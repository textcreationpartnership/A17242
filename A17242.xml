            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

Bunny, <hi>a member of the one, wisheth such like measure of Graces to both, as whereby still they may be, as (by the goodnesse of God) already they are, speciall good instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to the aduancement of the kingdome of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong vs, and beautifull Ornaments to those that haue beene the planters of them, and to those that still maintaine them.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat I make so bold, as in this sort to offer these my labours vnto your graue and learned censure, it is not for any worthinesse of the thing it selfe, as in any sense it may be mine, or for any thing it hath yet had by me: but for the hope that I haue conceiued, that in time it may haue by some of you; as a <hi>Lazarus</hi> now assaying againe, though once he was but little regarded, whether yet he can speede any better at the rich mans gate.</p>
            <p>None other foundation, we all doe know, can any man lay, but that which is long since already laide, euen <hi>Iesus Christ:</hi> but the building which others may reare therupon, may well be diuers; either commendably answering the foundation laide, or (yet not without reproach and losse to the workeman) swearuing from it. It may answere the foundation laide, as also it may swearue from the same, either in substance: or else but in forme or manner onely. As for the substance (God be thanked for it) there may hardly bee found any such variance at all among vs (I know not of any) as may not in good, or some tollerable sense haue place in the building. The maner is diuers: one kind, that which is commonly vsed by all, the other, that which this present intention of mine doth point vnto. That which is commonly vsed by all, is but to deale by particulars: as either by whole Bookes a-part by themselues; or else by seuerall parcels or portions thereof. And this if we marke, we may see to be the course of all generally: not onely in the deliuery of the Word of God by word of mouth, as we terme it, as by Sermons and Lectures: but also euen of all our writers too, in a maner both olde and new; whether they haue taken but cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Bookes or some parcels of them in hand, or whether they haue dealt with them all.</p>
            <p>The course that this intention of mine doth point vnto, is altogether another thing &amp; diuers from it: not in any dislike of the other but to make vse of this also. For that other is not onely blamelesse in it selfe: but of singular moment withall. And this that I speake of as so far from crossing the other: that it discloseth, both a
<pb facs="tcp:7530:4"/> readier, and an easier way vnto it. Neither is it any more but onely to deale first with the whole, and to contriue it into one entire Body: as if hauing the portra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or Image of the body of man, in metall, wood, or stone, but all the members se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered from the body, and from their owne proper places, and in many seueral par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels themselues, a man should in such sort dispose thereof, and lay euery one to his fellow, that so he should giue forth the true shape thereof againe. Making no doubt, but the best way to come to the knowledge of all particulars, is first to bee acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted well with the whole.</p>
            <p>In my measure, at such a thing herein haue I aimed: but graunting withall, that it is farre beyond any furniture that is in me, in such sort to handle it, as the worthinesse thereof doth require. Therefore haue I made this offer thereof vnto you: yet not onely on mine owne desire, that so it may come to better handling; but also, on a good hope that I haue conceiued, that God will in his good time, set some of you on worke about it. And beginners being first directed vnto the whole, and being orderly holpen therin, after that so, for some reasonable time, they haue beene made acquainted with it, may then at their pleasure descend to particulars: and, as by a more orderly course; so to their much better aduantage. In so much that the thing it selfe is not so much to be commended to any, as that wee all may iustly maruaile, that of so many rare and excellent men, that former ages, and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially this of ours, both for learning and godly care, haue raised vnto vs: yet is there none, that I do know of, not any one, that hath taken the course that now we speake of; though otherwise, in their kinde, they haue done maruailous well, and many of them in very great measure.</p>
            <p>In that my abridgement in Latin, of Master <hi>Caluines</hi> Institutions, wherein also I shewed, what method I conceiued him to obserue (which to the yonger Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, members of the one bodie of you, many yeares since, 1579. I then did dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate) I both mooued such a thing, and promised withall, that if others should not doe it before, my selfe would make proofe, what I might bee able to doe therein. Since which time I haue now and then, lesse or more, beene dealing with it: and this is the thing that it hath pleased God to vouchsafe me therein to doe.</p>
            <p>Those that haue gone on all the whole Bible, or (which is the same) on all the Scriptures, haue gone nearest vnto it: but so farre as they haue gone indifferently on all (on one booke after another in like sort of those that are of Doctrine, as of those that deliuer the Storie intermingling the one with the other; and haue not bin carefull to make their choice of such as did appertaine to the body of the whole, and so to dispose them) so farre haue they also missed the course that now we speake of. But these matters are more plaine in themselues, then that we need any farther businesse to lay them open.</p>
            <p>Neither is it lightly to be regarded, that such as are to acquaint others with those things that doe appertaine to the Kingdome of God, should by obseruing this course, euer deliuer vnto the people (and that in some better order then hath beene vsed) the vndoubted word of God: it being of most assured testimonie, both that it is mighty in operation; and that when it is not carefully deliuered, in some mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure as it ought to be, (as also, in these dayes of the Gospell, oftimes it is not, euen by men of notable gifts so farre as they seeke themselues withall) thence is it, that so little conuersion is wrought thereby among the people. The people againe, hauing those things gathered in some plaine and easie manner may haue good encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereby, to acquaint themselues better therewith.</p>
            <p>In both which (that more comfortable dicharge of your owne duties therein, I
<pb facs="tcp:7530:4"/> meane, and the raising vp of the hearts of the people to a sound desire of those other matters) the better heede that you take, neuer to let downe those good orders that already you haue, &amp; the more careful that you are euer to repaire the ruines there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of as occasion is offered, the more sauorie Salt shall you bee your selues, and so bee more able to season others: as on the other side, the lesse that smaller matters are in such case regarded; the harder doth it afterward prooue to withstand disorder in those that are greater.</p>
            <p>God euer vouchsafe you the mercy, both that you may grow rich in all good gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: and that euer you be carefull withall, readily to bestow them, to the glory of him that gaue them; and to the helpe of those that neede them.</p>

Than, hauing a dore of farther imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment opened vnto me, &amp; accordingly (in some measure) both aduising my selfe, and seeking farther, as in such a case it behoueth, what course I were best to take therin, it pleased God to lay me forth such a course as was not so vsuall: both for those among whom I was to bestow my labour; &amp; for the forme or manner of that, which I was to deliuer vnto them. Of the parties it is not needfull to speake, in the case that now we are in: but for the forme or manner of that which I was to deliuer, it was the very same that here I do now offer vnto thee. I haue bin therin occupied long; euen for the most part of my time, since I began it: &amp; both my selfe haue found that benefit by it, and many others too (as of their owne accord them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues haue deliuered) that I could not, but in dutie, both set it downe, and impart it to others. No new thing at all, in the substance of it; but such as soundeth (and that in great measure too, God be thanked in these blessed daies of the Gospell) all Christendome ouer, especially in these Churches of ours: but for the forme or manner of it, though handled by me, but after my plaine and simple endeauour; yet such in it selfe notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, as to my knowledge (and as before I haue said, is neither yet vsed by any, nor by our Writers (Old, or New) deliuered vnto vs.</p>
            <p>In which kinde of labour as I was occupied, occasion was offered, to giue forth some part of it before: by which occasion long since I gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and soone after published, a forme or manner of the Lawes of God, such as he gaue to the children of Israel: terming it the Scepter of <hi>Iudah;</hi> and publishing it, 1584. In it I acknowledged, that then already I had a greater worke in hand, which but in much longer time, I could not get ready: and in truth it prooued much longer, than I conceiued. Yet now at the length, God hath vouchsafed that mercy vnto me, that in some sort, or according to my measure, I haue gotten it ready, and now at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent salute thee with it.</p>
            <p>The effect of it is, the whole body of those Scriptures that are Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall, generally: but for orders sake, I haue thought best to distribute the
<pb facs="tcp:7530:6"/> same into a couple of Tomes; and each of them into a couple of Bookes. The former of these two Tomes likewis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s of the Olde Testament: the latter, of the New, and somewhat farther. In that which is of the Olde Testament, the former of those two Bookes, is of Historie: the later, of Doctrine. In that which is of History my endeauour hath been, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact or knit all the seuerall parts together, so to make one body of it: and withall, to draw it forth in equall proportion, as a thred that is euen spun; not lesse not bigger in one place then another, but alike, so neare as I could. But to the ende, that of the History better vse may be made, there is euer now and then Doctrine deliuered, as the History it selfe doth oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion, and as it pleased God to vouchsafe me to espie. In that which is of Doctrine, my endeauour hath not beene to gather all into one Body (which notwithstanding I had in election, and my selfe was much incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vnto it) but haue resolued on the better course, as I do take it: name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to take all those whole Bookes that are of that sort, as they lie; and but onely to lay forth a Method of them. But whereas in those Bookes that are most of History, we haue diuers parcels that doe rather appertaine vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Doctrine, especially in those that are accounted the Books of the Law, those parcels haue I gathered to that Booke which is of Doctrine: and those Lawes of God, not onely in parcels as they lie, but haue gathered them all besides, as it were into one entire Bodie. In that which is of the New Testament, the former of those two Bookes is of the estate of the Church or people of God, during the time of Christ, and of his Apostles: the latter of them, a compendious, or briefe recitall of the Story of the Church among vs Gentiles, from the time of the Apostles vnto this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Age wherein we liue.</p>
            <p>The vse of these as I doe conceiue, and as I hope that God will blesse them, will be of good and speciall moment: and to his blessing I do com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend it. But one thing there is, that my selfe might in some sort com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend vnto such, as shall be disposed so to take it. The Saboathes we all doe graunt, the most of vs the Holy-daies also in a second degree) were best to be spent in some godly exercise or other. The Scriptures we haue and other good Bookes, in great plenty, which to such end we may vse to the glory of God, and to the edyfying of our selues and others: and euery one is at his liberty to vse any such at his owne discretion, in all lawful and orderly manner.</p>
            <p>In this worke of mine, there be two chiefe and principall matters: one of History; the other of Doctrine. The knowledge of the History that herein is deliuered (euen frō the beginning vnto this present Age of ours) I am very sure, is to speciall good vse, to such as would profit themselues by the word of God, whether by reading or hearing the same. Some rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable measure of this knowledge doe I conceiue might soone be had, by all such as can be content to take some reasonable paines about it. On this perswasion of mine, and on the hope I haue thereof, I haue thought good to put such in mind as shall in themselues be so disposed (otherwise leauing it free to euery one to exercise themselues in those times, with whatsoeuer other good exercise themselues thinke best) of a way that I haue thought, to such a purpose might well be vsed. In those Bookes that are most of Historie, there are (as I take it) three hundred and nine Secti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
<pb facs="tcp:7530:6"/> in the former Booke of the former Tome, two hundred and thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene; of the Story of Christ in the first foure Chapters of the former Booke of the latter Tome, thirtie and one; and in the latter Booke of the latter Tome (a briefe History of the Church) threescore and fiue; and so consequently, three hundred and nine in all. And these, in such odde times of our Sabaothes and Holy-daies, as betwixt, before, or after Diuine-Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, or publique-Prayer, we haue to spare, might wee easily in such sort bestow, as that in the yeare we should goe through the whole. Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baothes, we know, are euery yeare fiftie and two: our seuerall Hollidaies, (the Circumcision, twelfe day, Purification, <hi>Matthy,</hi> the Annunciation, <hi>Marke, Philip</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> Ascension day, <hi>Iohn Baptist, Peter, Iames, Bartholo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mew, Matthew, Michael, Luke, Simon</hi> and <hi>Iude, All-Saints, Andrew, Thomas,</hi> and the <hi>Natiuitie</hi> of <hi>Christ)</hi> twenty likewise. But whereas we haue three principal Feasts, which haue mo Holy-dayes to them appertaining, thogh it may be wel conceiued, that to this purpose it wil not be n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>df<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> to take in all such times in them (that so the people, such as are so disposed, may haue some part thereof to any honest recreation): yet, because those Feasts are all of speciall note, if therefore we shall thinke good, to take out to this purpose, that which is the next, or second day of euery of them; so we shal haue three and twenty in al. Againe, in euery of these we lightly haue three seuerall portions of time, besides those that both morning and eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning are appointed for publique Prayer: the first in the morning, before the time of morning-Prayer; the next, after dinner, before euening-Prayer; the third after. The Sabaoth likewise we all doe graunt, would bee on all hands more carefully obserued: and so it shall not be amisse, if any of it allot two of those three portions of time that before we noted, to this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise that now we speake of. The Holi-daies also would not be so much neglected as (vnder pretence of zeale sometimes, and then for that cause so much the worse) now by many of vs they are: and so might we obserue them so much the better, to take one of those three portions of time that before we noted, out of them to this purpose also. So will it fal out, that if we take order with our selues, to read fiue of those Sections euery Saba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oth (three in the former of those times that we take, and two in the later) that in the yeare we shall so haue read, two hundred and threescore of them. On those our other Holi-daies likewise if we shall read, on euery one a couple of those Sections, those Holi-daies being twenty and three, so shal we dispatch sixe and forty moe of those Sections. Then wil there remaine but onely three: and those may we well allot to three of those o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Holi-daies that we have in those our three principall Feastes, to eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of those three, but one. And all these are none other but of the history: and these may serue for the first yeare that any shall betake himselfe to the exercise that now we speake of.</p>
            <p>In those parts of the whole worke that are for the most part of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine (which are, all the latter Booke of the former Tome, and the sixe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene last Chapters of the former Booke of the latter Tome; the former of the Olde Testament, these latter Chapters of the New) first I note no more but this, that both those whole Books of Scripture, and those other seuerall portions besides, whereof they consist, are laide, I trust, a great deale more open vnto the Reader, then otherwise they would haue been;
<pb facs="tcp:7530:7"/> and yet the same very briefly too: and that, whosoeuer would haue some Method, either for any whole Booke of the Canonicall Scripture, or for any Chapter or lesse portion thereof, there may he haue it, some or other, such as it is.</p>
            <p>But then as touching such vse of these parts also, as before wee haue spoken of in the other, if any be disposed to set in hand with a second year also, they may soone (I trust) find, that the Sections of these parts are, of the second Booke of the former Tome, two hundred thirty and sixe, and the residue of the first Booke of the later Tome, one hundred &amp; twelue in all, three hundred forty eight, &amp; so thirty mine more then the others. For the Sabaothes therefore and for those Holi-daies of the second yeare, we may take of these, as before of the others: and so haue but those thirty and nine remaining; which may fitly bee bestowed on a second portion of time on those Holidaies which first we named, two a peece on euery one. For those (excepting Saint <hi>Thomas</hi> his day before the Natiuitie) are but nineteene, and so take vp but thirty and eyght; and that day of Saint <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> because of the businesse that commonly it hath (because of those ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lydaies that follow soone after) may well bee allowed, to bee charged no farther, for that second portion of time that it hath, but onely with one: and so haue we al placed for the second yeare also.</p>
            <p>But then, wherof diuers times Sundaies and Holidaies meete together in one, and then (in Diuine-Seruice, and set Sermons) the most vsuall ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is, that the one drowneth the other, in this case it might bee perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med (by such as may haue conuenient leisure) in some time of the weeke ensuing: and the same course might be likewise obserued, so often as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise the exercise wee speake of, were by any occasion omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. It may be likewise, that some would conceiue, it were much better, if in some Table it were set downe, what Sections would so fall out to be for euery day, and for the seuerall portions thereof: but neither could that so well be done, because so many of those Sundayes and Holidaies are so mooueable; and in this course that now we haue noted, may euery one at all times beginne, whensoeuer himselfe shall be disposed so to do. As also because some Sections are much longer, and some other but short euery one may vse his owne discretion and freedome therein, both in the one, and in the other, as himselfe is disposed.</p>
            <p>As touching the benefite, that in thine estate towards God, both in this present life heere, and in that which is to come, is like (by the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and grace of God) to redound vnto thee, if truly thou employ thy selfe therein, and seekest withall thy successe from aboue, so often haue I seene the good hand of God on many therin, that I cannot but hope, but that it will be gracious and comfortable to thee likewise: and the more it shall please God to extend his goodnesse to thee therein, the more be his name glorified therefore; and be thou more carefull, both safely to keepe, and still to encrease that gracious Talent, that so it shall please him, in trust to commend vnto thee.</p>
            <p>Of all the whole together, yet, by thy pacience, one thing more; this manner of teaching by the whole Body of holy Scriptures, doe I take to be of such importance, to the ouerthrowing of the power of darkenesse, and both to let in, and to settle in the hearts of the faithful the loue of the
<pb facs="tcp:7530:7"/> Truth, that if it should be taken in hand by any that should be rightly fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished to such a purpose, and accordingly disposed withall, as in former ages there were many and diuers Engines of great force in Warres; but none like to the inuention of Gunnes since both great and smal: so in this spirituall warfare of ours, it might well fall out, that although wee haue many and diuers waies to impugne that power of darkenesse that of late did so ouerwhelme vs, and those very forcible; yet such vnfoulding and laying open of the word of God, being rightly and kindly handled in deed would bee the most forcible Engine (to batter downe Popery, and the whole power of Satan too) that yet we haue vsed.</p>
            <p>And for thy better furtherance heerin, before thou shalt enter into the Books themselues, thou hast some farther helpes besides: some, that may be to the vse of all; one other such, as for many of the common sort will be needfull also. Those which may be to the vse of all, are concerning the matter it selfe: and they are, in that the effect of the whol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> and of eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the seueral Bookes by themselues is laide forth, first to the Learned, in the Tables of Method prefixed; then, to the residue, in the Contents of the Chapters, after the vsuall manner, besides. That other, that for many of the common sort will bee needfull also, is about the quotations of the Scriptures that therein are vsed: to which end I haue likewise set down (for the readier going to all the places that there are noted) not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the names of the Bookes themselues, as in our Bibles they are wont to be noted; but for some farther, and the more easie getting of them a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod likewise, in what sort they may be well taken.</p>
            <p>Those few moe that concerne the manner wherein it now proceedeth or commeth forth, are, one of them before intended: others, comming in at the Window since. That which was before intended, is, that the Tables are framed to the Capitall Letters in the inner Margent, as other books for the most part are vnto the Pages. The reason is, for that the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles were made before, while the Booke was but in writing, and so could not bee knowne then, of what number the Pages would be when they should be printed: but then those Letters do note in effect, but Pages al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, for that they all in euery Section (the first and the last, which must euer take their place as it falleth, only excepted) had the space of a writtē page.</p>
            <p>At the Window (that I speake of) are other two come in since: one, in certaine of the Sections; the other, in the quotations onely. In the Sections no more but this, that a few of the first of them, are into diuers parcels, by Breakes (as they tearme them) diuided: which for a while on supposall was done, as thinking thereby to ease the Readers labor there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. That which is in the quotation, is, that therein for a time they haue followed their wonted order: whereas the manner of these quotations, are to distinguish the number that noteth the Chapter with a Colon, or Middle-distinction from the verses that follow; and some-times to sort the verses also (as the case doth sometimes require) by some other distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions besides.</p>
            <p>These are the things that thus I do commend vnto thee: and that they may prooue to thy greater good, the successe thereof, together with thy selfe and thine, I commend to the good blessing of God.</p>

               </gap>ing therefore that the whole Citty were forward worshippers of their supposed Goddesse <hi>Minerua,</hi> hee thought, that happily there might some consequence to his desire that way be had. He aduiseth himselfe therefore of some such personable wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, as might best serue to such a purpose, attireth her accordingly, placeth her in a Coach, and <hi>Pisistratus</hi> with her, and causeth proclamation to be made as they entered into the Citty, and as they passed farther therein, as in the name of that their great and mighty Goddesse, that they in any wise receiued him againe, whom her selfe vouchsafed so to bring home. The people therefore so suddainely taken, made no stay for that matter, and so busily worshipped that their Goddesse, besides, that plainly they haue shewed themselues to haue swallowed. In these daies of ours, much stickling we haue about those vaine conceits in Religion, which the latter Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> partly, of ignorance, but much more on priuate respect, haue matched with the truth in Christ, and still would vphold in that so transcendent a place for them. Howbeit, the power of the truth is so strong against them, that euery where they daily fall more and more, and in many places are already quite discarded. Heerupon, diuers wily pies among vs, noting with themselues, of what reckoning the name of the Catholicke Church is, generally with all (not only with those that to their owne purpose abuse it, but with many others of the people be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, of all sortes or degrees whatsoeuer) haue often endeuoured, and daily yet do, (vnder that reuerend name of the Church) to bring in againe those already de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciphered and exiled trumperies of theirs, no more approued by the true Catholicke Church indeed, than that Gallant was, then brought in by that supposed Goddesse of theirs. A thing, which at that time was so much the more absurdly done of them, for that then they had a <hi>Solon,</hi> a right worthy man among them indeede, and one that altogether studied the peace and welfare of that state of theirs: yet nothing so absurdly as should be done by vs, if hauing Christ and his truth so presently with vs, we should by any such pageant suffer our selues to bee so far abused. It is noted <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> likewise, that the woman who sustained the person of that supposed Goddesse, was <hi>Phya</hi> by name: and certain it is, that such as in these dayes of ours, do most ingrosse to themselues the reputation or Title of the Catholicke Church, are (besides that intolerable presumptiō of theirs) so grosse in Idolatry, so beastly in life, that if any in the vehemency of his spirit, should leaue the propriety of the Greeke, and in plaine English vrge such application of it, as in some sort the word might lead vnto, thogh such application might be somewhat distastful, yet had they no iust cause to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine, laying their owne deserts out thereunto.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:7530:13"/> 2. These things are yet but onely saide: namely, that those points of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Religion, for which they do so busily striue in these our daies against the gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, are not such as the true Catholicke Church at any time vrgeth: and that those who in these our dayes do so much braue it vnder the name of the Church, though indeed they bee of the Church, because they professe (after a sort) Iesus Christ, yet (besides their life) euen their profession it selfe is such, as sheweth them to be excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding corrupt members thereof, &amp; so to leese their dignity therby. But the discourse that now ensueth, will so plainely declare the same, and make so good demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, that there wil need no further proofe at al vnto it. For therein shal we see, what people God hath euer had (euen from the beginning of the world) and what Religion or profession it was, that they did hold. In the people likewise wee shall see, that the greater multitude of them were but corruption in their profession, though, after a sort, they also did hold it: but that euer God reserued certain of thē, who in that corruption of others, did more truly hold, that which was professed by all.</p>
            <p>In their profession it selfe, we shall see likewise, that there was none other allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but only that which God himselfe prescribed; and that the better sort of them made their stand there: but that the others, led by the wisedom of flesh &amp; bloud, had diuers additions of their owne mingled therewith; and with them accounted altogether (in a manner) as currant too, as were the other appointed by God, by the prerogatiue that themselues had in being his people. Which if wee can apply to our selues, out of it may wee learne that, which will abundantly serue, both to represse the audaciousnesse of some, in the matters that now wee speake of, and to strengthen the weakenesse of others.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Comming therefore to the matter it selfe, wee are first to consider of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Title of those Books or writings that now we set in hand withal; and then, to come to the Bookes themselues. The Title, for the most part is, The <hi>Holy Bible,</hi> or the <hi>Holy-Scriptures,</hi> containing the <hi>Old-Testament</hi> and the <hi>New:</hi> or contained in the <hi>Old-Testament</hi> and the <hi>New.</hi> Wherein wee may note, that as touching the matter which in those Bookes wee haue deliuered vnto vs, we haue something noted, but generally: something againe, more specially. Generally, I account that to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, which doth concerne the whole: more specially, that which concerneth the chiefe and principall parts thereof. As touching the whole, whereas it is the wil and pleasure of God, deliuered vnto vs in Bookes, or in writings (for such is the meaning of the words, <hi>Bible,</hi> and <hi>Scriptures)</hi> we are first to consider, whereupon it may seeme to be, that God would leaue vnto vs his will and pleasure in writing: then, whereupon it is, that these Bookes, or these writings are counted holy. That hee would leaue vnto vs his will and pleasure in writing, it seemeth to be, both to preuent the malice of some, and to help the infirmity of all. The malice that other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise wee were like to finde in some, is, that diuers of those that are ill-disposed, would readily otherwise beare vs in hand, and strongly too, both that that was the word of God which indeed is, and that that were, which is not: vnlesse we had the Booke, both our selues to shew the one; &amp; to put them to shew the other. The common infirmity of vs all, is such, as that though we doe meane neuer so well, yet neyther can we well get the knowledge thereof to our selues, vnlesse we had it in such sort so ready, as that now and then we might peruse it: neither could wee, in any good manner, deliuer it ouer to others, but that in going from hand to hand, it wold soon be corrupted. Which things being considered, may sufficiently teach vs, as that it was maruellous il done of those that took frō the people the word of God, &amp; plainly enough bewrayed themselues thereby, that they had an ill meaning in it, so was it vnaduisedly done of others also (and yet is) to haue the same in so litle ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, as euer it hath bin the manner of the vnthankefull and carelesse world.</p>
            <p>Holy it is in two respects: first, in it selfe; then also, towards others. In it selfe it is Holy, for that it approueth nothing that is ill, nor condemneth any thing that is good: as also it must needs be such, and can be none other, proceeding as it doth,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:7530:13"/> not any thing at all from the wisedome of flesh and bloud; but altogether, &amp; only from the wisedome of God. Towards others it is <hi>Holy</hi> likewise; chiefely, because it sanctifieth or bettereth those that are truly occupied therein: but partly also, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it shall bee so seuerely required at the last day, of those that haue neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> the same; and now also in some measure is, in the meane season. As tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the chiefe and principall partes thereof, it is farther sayde, that those <hi>Holy Scriptures</hi> do containe the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New Testament:</hi> or else, that they are contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned therein. In which kinde of speech, the word <hi>[Testament]</hi> doth signifie that, which we commonly call a <hi>Couenant:</hi> and wee thereupon are to consider what Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenants they are that are signified thereby; and why the one is called the <hi>Old,</hi> and the other the <hi>New.</hi> The Couenants that are signified thereby, doe in some thinges agree together, though in some others they vary likewise. They agree in this, that they both offer vnto vs the fauour of God, and eternal life: and we are able (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly in themselues, and so that there be no want in vs) to performe the same. But in this they vary, that the one doth offer it by woorkes; and the other, by faith onely. The workes that are thereunto required, are none other, but onely such as make vp perfect righteousnesse; that is, not onely to be freed all our life long from all manner of euill (both in word and deede, without; and in our secrets thoughts within) and euer to do all manner of good (so that whatsoeuer we bring forth by deede or word, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> whatsoeuer wee conceiue within, all to be godly) but also, euer to haue auoyded all euil, and euer to haue done all maner of good, in so great and exquisite measure, as the rule of perfect righteousnesse requireth, with a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full detestation of the one, and a most absolute loue of the other.</p>
            <p>The faith that is required, is to put by all others, in heauen and earth, and for the whole worke of our Redemption, to rest in Iesus Christ alone: looking by his suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, to escape hell, and by his righteousnes to come vnto heauen. The former of which, is tearmed the <hi>Old,</hi> because it is antiquate to vs, in respect of any helpe that wee are able to get thereby, because wee can come nothing neere to doe the thinges that it requireth: so to giue vs to vnderstand, that of it we may looke for no helpe at all, but only requiring such things at our hands (so far exceeding what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer we are able to do) that thereby it put vs cleane out of doubt, that that way there is no good to be done: and therefore that wee leaue it or abandon it cleane, as an out-worne Garment, altogether vnable (in such respect) to bee of any vse vnto vs.</p>
            <p>The latter also is tearmed the <hi>New,</hi> as succeeding in the place of the other, to supply whatsoeuer we want therein: and as in it selfe, euer able to serue our turne; so on our parts euer to be of that reckoning with vs. Vpon the consideratiō of both <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> which, if any man should conceiue a farther question, whether, when as wee are not able to do whatsoeuer the Law requireth, it might be sufficient to do our best endeuour, and to get so neere it as we are able; the resolution thereof doth plainly shew it selfe to bee, both that it would not serue our turne, and that it is more also then needeth. That it would not serue our turne, may plainly appeare, for that the former of these two Couenants, doth strictly require absolute righteousnesse: and the other, nothing at al to rest on our selues, or any other, but vpon Iesus Christ a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone. So that taking neither of those courses that they prescribe, we might not look to haue the benefit of eyther: but bringing in a new of our owne, as we must needs graunt that GOD hath made none such with vs (but onely those two before rehear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed) so may we not looke that he shal that way saue vs, or vouchsafe vs that fauor of his, though otherwise he will bountifully reward whatsoeuer seruice we do to him. That it is more then needeth, also is plaine enough likewise, for that although wee cannot receiue that helpe by the former, because we cannot do the things thereby required, yet hath God so fully prouided for vs by the latter, that therein there is no want at all, but most absolute fulnesse, to all intents and purposes whatsoeuer.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The Booke it selfe, so farre as we are to deale with it now, deliuereth vnto vs two principall Stories: One, a generall story of the whole World: the other, a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:7530:14"/> more speciall story of the peculiar people of God. The generall story of the whole World, is deliuered vnto vs in the first eleauen Chapters of Genesis, and hath two principall parts: how God made all thinges at the first; and in what case they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward stood. How God made all things at the first, is commonly called the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: which is set down vnto vs, first generally; and then more specially. Generally it is said, <hi>That in the beginning God made the Heauen and the Earth.</hi> Where we are to <note place="margin">Genesis 1. 1.</note> note, that these things were not eternall, nor of themselues; but that they haue had their beginning (&amp; the same not long since neither, to speak of, litle more then fifty sixe mens liues, as some men yet liue, allotting but one hundered yeares to euerie one) and that they are the workemanship of God the Father, the Sonne, and the Holy Ghost. More specially we haue diuers thinges more plainely set downe: but most of them concerning the wotke he had in hand; and yet some of them concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the <hi>[Rest]</hi> that afterward he tooke.</p>
            <p>Concerning the worke that he had in hand, wee haue set downe how rude and vnhansome it was for a time: and then, to how excellent a worke it was brought <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> in the end. That it was but a rude and an vnhansome thing at the first, is set downe in this, that it is sayde; then to haue beene without shape and voyde, and that it <note place="margin">Genesis 1. 2.</note> was couered with darkenesse besides. Out of which we may learne, that euen the workes of God himselfe, and such as hee meaneth afterward to bring vnto speciall beauty, may notwithstanding for a time, be but of homely beginning: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no such thing to bee of vs eyther cleane reiected, or no more but lightly esteemed.</p>
            <p>To how excellent a worke it was brought in the end, is declared; first, in his dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with that whole vnhansome Masse it selfe: and then, in the creation of the particulars, that he framed out of the same. His dealing with that whole vnhansome <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> Masse it selfe, was that his Spirite did spreade foorth it selfe on the same: and, as the Nature of the Worde importeth, euen as a Byrde doth spread forth, and set her selfe close on her Egges, when she is to hatch or bring foorth her yong. By which wee may gather, what it is that bringeth to proofe whatsoeuer wee haue, that is so farre off, and so vnlikely at the first: euen the good Spirit of God, and none other power or deuise whatsoeuer.</p>
            <p>In the Creation of the particulars that hee framed out of the same, wee are first to consider of the thinges themselues: and then, what hee pronounceth of the Workemanshippe of them. As touching the thinges themselues, wee are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, not onely what they are: but also, in what order it pleased him to make them. What they were, is for the most part so plainely declared in the Text it selfe, that no body can chuse but see them therein: and yet are there some others that in the Iudgement of most men belong thereunto, that cannot so easily bee founde in the Text, or (at the least) not to lye so plainly there, as do the other.</p>
            <p>Those that are so plainly set downe in the Text it selfe, are first of all, one, that shoulde in some sort extend vnto all, and take away one speciall blemish that was on the whole Masse before: and then all the rest, that shoulde serue to perfect the worke that was in hande. That one, that should in some sort extende vnto all, and take away one speciall blemish that was vppon the whole <note place="margin">Ibid 3. 5.</note> Masse before, was the Light: so to put away the darkenesse that before coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red all.</p>
            <p>A verie good patterne that God is euer the Author of Light; and that, vntill he vouchsafe vs the same, we are nothing but palpable darkenes: as also, a good token withal, that these dayes of the Gospel (which are so hardly censured by others) are notwithstanding the good workemanshippe of GOD, because they bring the light with them, in so plentiful measure, that euen the Aduersaries also are light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned thereby, and by this light haue amended some of their former errours. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidue <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> that should serue to perfect the Worke that was in hande, were, some of them, but onely to distinguish or to drawe out of that whole Masse, the chiefe and principall parts of his intended worke, apart by themselues: Others again, to furnish them, so as his wisedome had determined to do.</p>
            <pb n="5" facs="tcp:7530:14"/>
            <p> Vnto the distinguishing, or drawing foorth of that whole Masse the chiefe and principall partes of his intended woorke apart by themselues, doe appertaine, that first he made that separation betwixt the Waters aboue, and the Waters beneath, <note place="margin">Gene. 1. 6. 8.</note> which we commonly call the Firmament, or the lowest Region of the Ayre; a brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing place before for such liuing creatures as he would make to enioy it: and that <note place="margin">Ibid. 9. 10.</note> he made the Waters beneath to withdraw themselues to the Channels and depths, that so the dry Land might appeare among them, which the Lord called the earth, and these waters themselues the Seas.</p>
            <p>The furniture that GOD bestowed on these, was first, of such thinges as had no sence: and then after, of such as had. Of those that had no sense, first, <note place="margin">Ibib. 11. 13.</note> hee cloathed the Earth with Grasse, Hearbes, and Trees: and then both adorned the Sky aboue, with those two greater lightes, the Sunne and the Moone (where <note place="margin">14. 19.</note> we haue it giuen in withall, that hee made also the Starres.) Of those Creatures of his that had sense, first hee furnished the Waters with Fish and Foule, and all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Creatures thereunto appertaining, blessing them also vnto increase or multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication: <note place="margin">20. 23.</note> and then the Earth, not onely with Beasts and Wormes of all sorts ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording <note place="margin">24. 31.</note> to their kind; but also with Man.</p>
            <p>Those others (that in the iudgement of most Men) belong thereunto, and yet are not so easily found in the Text, or at least not so plainely, are all those spirituall Creatures that otherwise wee read of, Angels and Diuels; both which are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly thought to be of this Creation, or part of those Creatures that appertaine vnto the workemanshippe of this World: the former of them, to haue beene made then such as they are yet; the latter of them to haue beene made good at the first, but that then they quickely fell, and so became such as they are. But seeing that neyther heere, nor any where else (but as some men doe thinke they may gather) the Scripture doth not set them downe to bee of this Creation, and maketh at all no mention of them in all this story; therefore as it is needlesse for vs to inquire far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, so it were, so much the worse so to determine, when as wee see it is more than needeth, and that we haue no warrant for it: and much safer to leaue it at large (as the Text it selfe doth) contenting our selues (for those matters) only with this, that they are the Creatures of God, not curiously searching when it pleased him to make them.</p>
            <p>It is (wee knowe) but of a small time to speake of, not sixe thousand yeares <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> since this World beganne, neyther is it of so great a compasse but that the Sunne compasseth, not onely the Earth, but one halfe of the higher Orbes likewise, in foure and twenty houres, and a Man (for the quantity or greatnesse of it, if o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise hee might haue conuenient, safe, and ready passage) might on foote tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile round about the whole Earth in lesse then three yeeres. Beyond all which time, and without all which spaces, as wee knowe that GOD hath beene for euer, so it may bee, that he hath had, and yet hath, many other workes in hand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides this.</p>
            <p>Wherein, although the most part goe with Saint <hi>Augustine,</hi> to allot Aungels <note place="margin">

But because in this World onely, GOD hath o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened himselfe vnto vs, and in none other; therefore, howsoeuer that hee accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his incomprehensible Maiesty, may well haue many woorkes besides this, both else-where, and before, and after; yet are wee to holde our selues content with this, and therein to learne to know the Maker of it, and not to suffer our conceits to wander further; as also wee neede not, because hee hath sufficiently opened himselfe in this, and not in any other to vs.</p>
            <p>In the order that it pleased him to obserue in the making of them, we haue diuers thinges to bee considered: some of them concerning those workes of his, (as wee may take them) all together; others, as they are to be considered seuerally, or ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken asunder.</p>
            <pb n="6" facs="tcp:7530:15"/>
            <p> As we may take them altogether, wee are to note, that all thinges were made first to the vse of Man: and that they were all made likewise before that Man him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe was made. Beeing all made to the vse of Man, we may see therein, both the great goodnesse of God towards vs, and both how carefully and how confidently we ought to serue him, that hath made those thinges for vs, and so backed vs with them in al his seruice.</p>
            <p>In that they were made before Man, wee may see a perpetuall patterne of his prouidence therein, that hee neuer bringeth any into the Worlde, but that first hee ordaineth thinges needfull for them, for the time that they shall bee there: euen as Milke in the Mothers breast for the Childe to sucke, before that euer the Childe bee borne to sucke the same. A very good patterne, alwaies to haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> our eyes, against that distrust that commonly haunteth the nature of man in those matters.</p>
            <p>As they are to be considered seuerally; we are first to consider of those creatures that were made before: and then of Man. In those Creatures that were made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, we are to note, both that all of them are set downe to be made by the power of the word of GOD: and that there was both day and night, before there was any Sunne at al. In that these thinges were made by the power of his Word, wee <note place="margin">Gene. 1. 3. 6. 9. 11. 14. 20. 24. 26. Ibid. 3. 14.</note> see not onely of what power himselfe is: but also that his Word (whereby hee made all) may well bee a sufficient meane of our Redemption, without any other mixture on earth whatsoeuer.</p>
            <p>In that there was day, before there was any Sunne (though since wee see, that when the Sunne is with vs, then it is day, and when it is departed, then it is night, and so might thinke that the presence of the Sunne is absolutely needfull to haue any day:) yet thereby may we learne, that although it pleaseth God ordinarilie to worke by such meanes; yet can he do otherwise so oft as he list, as in these hee hath left a patterne vnto vs.</p>
            <p n="5">5. In Man we haue many thinges to bee considered, as touching the order of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> his Creation, that as hee was ordained to bee (next vnder GOD) the Head of all the rest, so might we haue the workemanship of him more carefully set downe vnto vs; and first, how God made him; then, how he dealt with him when he was made. How GOD made him, to the end that wee may the better finde out, wee are to consider, that whereas hee made them both Male and Female, some thinges there are, that concerne them both together: some others againe, that concerne ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them apart by themselues.</p>
            <p>Those thinges that concerne them both together, doe first lye in that part of the Storie, that sheweth, how the God-head, or the Persons in Trinity, did <note place="margin">Gene. 1. 26.</note> first expresse or vtter their purpose therein, before that euer hee did set in hand to make him: then also, in another place that afterward followeth. Out of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer we may easily gather, that he was like to be a Creature of speciall importance; both for that it pleased GOD, so to aduise himselfe therein; and especially, for that hee should bee such an one, as it pleased him before-hand to shewe that hee should. For in that hee will shew himselfe, but to be aduised therein, needes must it import a matter of some speciall importance that thereuppon should bee done: as we see it is the manner of men, howsoeuer they will slightly and presently dispatch their common affaires; yet if any matter doe come of greater moment, then will they more specially enter into some set aduisement of it. Not that God needeth so to call his wittes together (hauing his wisedome euer present with him, and the depth of all thinges euer open before his owne eyes) but that thereby he would teach vs to consider, of how excellent a woorkemanshippe hee meant to haue him.</p>
            <p>What before hand hee shewed hee should bee, dooth sufficiently appeare in these two pointes; that both himselfe should bee endewed with such graces within, and haue such power ouer all the Creatures of GOD besides, both in the Sea and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:7530:15"/> Land, that therein he should be a right Image of God, and euer represent his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son on earth.</p>
            <p>The latter of them is, that afterward it is saide; that though they were both of them naked, yet were they not ashamed: an euident token, that the workemanship <note place="margin">Genesis 2. 25.</note> of God is good in it selfe, but that by sin, it is since defiled in vs. And though nowe we cannot see (in this corruptible estate that since we are in) how excellent a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture then we were made (no more then in the Dust and rubbish of some excellent building, what was the building it selfe before) because now wee are to beare the Image of the earthly: yet, no doubt, the woorkemanship was then of some won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull beauty, (farre passing all that we are able to thinke and conceiue) when as both that wonderfull and glorious God-head, would shewe himselfe to take such aduice therein, and before-hand gaue it so honourable a Title, that it should be like to himselfe; and they both likewise found no deformity at all in themselues, when as wee (if there be any shame fastnesse in vs) are full ill ashamed now, not onely of the foulest partes of vs, but of others also lesse stained then those, euen before the neerest friendes that wee haue, and though there be some speciall cause to vncouer the same, vnlesse it bee some vrgent necessity that enforce vs vnto it. Of which beauty of ours then, if wee would gladly haue some such little tast as heere wee are able, wee are to take heede, that from our selues now, wee doe not seeke to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, what that woorkemanship of God should bee: but that from his vnsearcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble wisedome and goodnesse, wee search to finde out, what it is likely our selues were then; how wise, how holy, how free, how mighty, how comely, how rich, how glorious withall.</p>
            <p n="6">6 Those others that concerne either of them apart by themselues, do some of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> them appertaine vnto the Creation of the Man: &amp; others, vnto the Creation of the Woman: Vnto the Creation of the Man it appertaineth to consider; first, of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> making of his Body: and then, how hee was a little while after indewed likewise with a liuing Soule. Concerning his body, wee are to note, first, of how meane a peece of stuffe that same was raised, or how homely a beginning it had: and then, to what a peece of excellent workemanship it was afterward framed. His homely beginning appeareth in this, that his body was made of the Dust or slime of the <note place="margin">Genesis 2. 7.</note> Earth: on our part, a good preseruatiue against pride, if the matter bee well consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered; on Gods part, that he is able, of small beginnings to accomplish his greater purposes. To what a peece of excellent workemanshippe it was afterward framed, will indeede most fully appeare, when the Soule is vnited vnto his body. But yet notwithstanding, if we looke no further but onely vnto the Body it selfe before the Soule was breathed into it, euen therein also it may plainely appeare, that it was brought to an excellent woorke, and that partly if wee doe behold but that which may bee seene with the eye; but especially if wee goe somewhat further, to that which representeth it selfe to our vnderstanding. As touching that which may bee seene with the eye, wee are to know, that since the fall wee are not able so well to behold the excellency of it, partly for some deformity that is fallen to the Body it selfe; and partly by a corrupt disposition in our selues likewise. The deformity that since is fallen to the Body it selfe, is part of it but peculiar to some: but part of it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine common to al.</p>
            <p>That which is but peculiar to some, are all those imperfections or wants, or when any thing is too much or too little, as somtimes we see in diuers of vs. That which is cōmon to al, is partly our whole nakednesse generally (some few parts only excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) but especially, our secrets, or priuy parts. That corrupt disposition that is in vs, is fleshly concupisence: whereby it commeth to passe, that beeing so far stained with sinne as now it is, our eye can no sooner light on the nakednesse of any (espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially on those partes aforesaid) but that by and by it turneth it selfe aside, as from some vncleannesse that much offendeth the fight thereof. So that in the estate that now we are in since the fall, we may not looke to finde how beautifull workeman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship the body was of, so far as might bee seene with the eye: much lesse, so farre as
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:7530:16"/> then it might represent it selfe to our vnderstanding, for that now the same is much darkened in vs, and nothing able to finde out many of those thinges that therein were to be found. But yet that it was of very great beauty may sufficiently appeare, principally in the thing it selfe, as yet it standeth: but partly also, euen in that cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt disposition of ours likewise, that euen nowe was noted so much to hinder vs. For as touching the thing it selfe, as yet it standeth, although in the Bodies of dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> wee see sometimes something too much, and more often of the two, some thing too little: yet are those but the Badges of sinne, and but very few in respect of the rest; and all the residue doe yet resemble the workemanshippe thereof to haue beene of great wonder indeede, whether wee respect the beauty or feature of euery member, or part in it selfe, or the apt distinguishing or knitting of them altogether, in so wonderfull good proportion and beauty. And as for that cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt disposition of ours, of what force soeuer we finde it to bee, to make either Sex to delight in the other, and in the sight of the bodyes of those whom so they doe loue: of the like, and greater, may we probably thinke would bee that holy and chast loue, that GOD at the first did giue vnto them the one towardes the other, in the whole and in euery part, to admire the wonderfull art of the Maker. That the force of this stained loue that nowe wee haue, is to such purpose great, and maketh vs to finde great workemanshippe euen in the Body; it appeareth, not onely in that good liking that in such case we haue of the Body it selfe: but in this likewise, that such as haue skill rightly to resemble whatsoeuer proportions or shapes they doe conceiue, doe not lightly finde any thing that for woorkeman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippe, or good proportion and beauty, dooth generally delight the beholders more, then the resemblance of it, though left more open vnto the eye, then the bounds of modesty may well allow.</p>
            <p>And although, if the worke-man hath gone too farre therein, then they are but the lighter and looser sort, that doe take such pleasure in it: yet both so long as the boundes of modesty are duely obserued, good workemanshippe is then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull to all; and that staine of loue that nowe is in vs, cannot make vs more to like now of that which exceedeth, then the power and force of that holy loue that then was in vs, could make vs to like of the thing it selfe then; both in respect of the worke it selfe, and in respect of him that made it. But if wee goe further, to that which may come within the reach of our vnderstanding, then doe wee see, (though nothing so cleerely as wee might before) that such is the power and need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful vse of euery part, and of altogether, and so wonderfull aptly framed thereunto, that many that were but natural men, could no sooner enter into the cōsideration of it, but that they found themselues ouer-matched in the depth of wisedome, power, and goodnesse, that they saw to shew forth themselues in the least of them all.</p>
            <p>When the Soule was vnited vnto it, then was it more fully seene, what was the workemanshippe of it. For then could the eye see; the eare, heare; the tongue, frame it selfe vnto speach; and euery part and member thereof, doe the proper worke thereunto appertaining. VVhere we may note by the way, that therein we <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> haue a right patterne of the difference or oddes that wee finde betwixt the Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, and Regenerate man, in such thinges as belong to the Kingdome of God: for though (otherwise) they bee learned and wise, and so might seeme to haue a great in-sight thereby in matters that doe belong to the kingdome of GOD; yet so long as they be but Naturall men, as the eye of <hi>Adam</hi> did not see, nor his eare heare, vntill he had a liuing soule breathed into him; so these also, haue no iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at all in matters of Religion, to approoue or like of that which is sound, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till they bee regenerate or borne againe the Children of God, or (which is all one) become a new Creature in Iesus Christ.</p>
            <p>And from this difference it is, that when at any time the word of GOD is offered indifferently vnto all, some there bee, that haue no feeling thereof, and others, that like thereof maruellous well: the one sort hauing but such eyes and eares yet, as can neyther see nor heare, in those matters; the others, by that latter byrth of theirs, hauing them so inabled to such a purpose, as that therein they are
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:7530:16"/> able to deale with a speciall feeling vnto themselues, and a singular comfort out of the same.</p>
            <p>As touching the Soule it selfe, we are to note two principall matters: the former of them, whence it is; the other, the nature or excellency of it. Whence it is, wee are so much the rather to note, because diuers, by such likelihoodes as they haue conceiued, haue taken the Soule to bee nothing else in effect, but onely some ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary concretion, and so consequently, both to followe the temperature of the <note place="margin">Gene. 2. 7.</note> body, and to bee but Mortal also: Whereas notwithstanding, not onely this Text doth plainely say; that God breathed into him the breath of life, and that so he was a liuing Soule (and so doth shew it to be another thing, then any way arising out of the Body; and that another gift of God) but euen the wiser sort of the World like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, would neuer yeeld to thinke so grossely of it. And although (because it may seeme to follow the temperature of the Body) it was so much the rather thought with diuers of them, that it must bee of that Nature also, (deceiuing themselues with a false principle;) yet heerein may wee see, that it was not raised out of the Earth as was his Body, nor out of any other Element whatsoeuer, but that it came immediatly of God: and therefore neither may it so properly bee saide to follow, (though the experience that we haue, may seeme that way much to incline) but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to vse, as it thinketh good, such temperature as the body hath; and that well, if the Soule be good; otherwise worse, if the Soule be ill.</p>
            <p>As also we are taught by experience it selfe (if wee be able rightly to take it) that whatsoeuer temperature the Body be of, or as we vse most commonly to speake, of whatsoeuer complexion it bee, it may be vsed eyther well or ill: as Choller, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> to a godly zeale; and Flegme, to a good moderation withall (and so of the rest) if the Soule be good; but otherwise, the one to vnbridled passions and anger; the other, to slothfulnesse (and so of the rest) if the Soule bee ill. Much like as a Man in a fray, or a Worke-man in following his businesse, is sometimes driuen, the one to such Weapon, the other to such Instrument, not as either of them would fainest haue, or at that time were meetest for them, but such as then they haue, or any way can get howsoeuer: and yet in neither may bee saide to follow, though it bee such as best he liketh, but rather to vse that which he getteth.</p>
            <p>The nature or excellency of it, wee haue likewise set downe in two speciall points: First, because immediatly it came by the breathing on of GOD; then al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so of the effectes, because that by and by that Body did so become a liuing Man.</p>
            <p>For comming from GOD, and in such sort as it did, it must needes bee of speciall price: and by and by quickning the whole Body, and taking place there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in (as a Prince in his Kingdome) in the whole, and in euery part thereof, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in both working and ruling so woonderfully as it dooth, there may bee no questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with any, but that it is of wonderfull excellency, and that much greater, than our selues that haue it, are thereby able for to conceiue. Insomuch, that it is lesse maruaile, that diuers of the wiser sort of the World haue accounted Man, consisting now of Body and Soule (yet after the fal, when both these were much defaced, and seeing no more then they did neither) to be no lesse then a litle world: and certaine withal, that much rather they would haue made that reckoning of him, if they had had a farther light of the word of God, and might haue seene him (with former eyes) as he was at the first.</p>
            <p n="7">7. In the special discourse of the Creation of the Woman, wee are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> not onely in what manner shee was made: but also, of a certaine Mysterie that therein is further deliuered vnto vs. Vnto the manner of her Creation it dooth appertaine, first to consider of some thinges that went before, concerning the same: and then, to come to the thing it selfe. Those thinges that went before concerning the same, are some of them ascribed to GOD himselfe: and some vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Man. Vnto God are ascribed these two:</p>
            <pb n="10" facs="tcp:7530:17"/>
            <p> First, that he saide, <hi>That it was not good that Man should be alone:</hi> then, that hee added thereunto, <hi>That he would make him an helpe meete for him,</hi> or such another as himselfe. In that he sayde, <hi>That it was not good that Man should be alone,</hi> we are to gather, both out of the consideration of the wisedome of him that spake it, and of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> the time when it was spoken, that though it please God sometime to giue that spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall guift (at least for a time) to liue single, and yet therein not to burne: yet houl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly or generally, it is not good for vs to liue vnmarried. For, if God in his wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome did see that it was not good, needs must it be but folly in man, to thinke o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise of it: and if it were not good then (before sinne did enter in vpon vs) needs must it be, in that respect, so much the more needfull now. So that out of this one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly place, though there were no other Scripture besides, yet might wee indifferent plainly see, how vnaduised a course it is, not onely to forsweare marriage (as it was the manner of our Cleargy of late to doo) but also, so much to abstaine from mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, vnlesse there be some speciall and vrgent cause, as it is the manner of most of those, that finde no necessity in themselues to marry. For though they neede not, and in such case may vse their liberty, as themselues did thinke good; yet they must take heede, that they do not abuse it neyther: and, when God hath saide, <hi>That it is not good to be alone,</hi> let them take heede that they play not the fooles, to liue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marryed.</p>
            <p>In that he sayd, <hi>He would make him an help like to himselfe,</hi> we may note likewise, not onely what benefit there was therein at the first, as God did then ordaine the same; and whereunto Wiues should now also endeuour to frame themselues; that is, to be good helpes to their Husbands: but also, so farre as it pleaseth God, yet to vouchsafe vs the benefit of his ordinance (if we betake our selues thereunto, as we ought to do) so farre do we defraud our selues of that needefull helpe, if (without some speciall good cause) we enforce our selues to liue vnmarried. And that among those that at any time marry, such reckoning should be made the one of the other, as that each of them should euer be (as it were) another selfe to each other.</p>
            <p>Those that are ascribed to Man, may be two likewise: And yet it is not to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed, but that the former of them is by diuers (and lyeth fayre for it) otherwise ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. The former of them, is in such sort placed in the Originall, that as the forepart of the sentence is plainly atributed to him, so may the latter part also: &amp; yet is it no great matter in effect neither, though it likewise be attributed to God. But beeing attributed to man, the former of them is, that hauing al those creatures of God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, to giue them their names, so (as it were) to set his marke or burne vppon them, he found none of them all meete for himselfe, to such a purpose. The latter, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> that his words after seeme to import (in that he maketh so speciall a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt those two times, when now he found none, and afterward when one was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented vnto him: for so the words in the Hebrew import) that hee had some desire himselfe vnto it.</p>
            <p>If among all those creatures that were brought before him, he found none meet to be ioyned with him, as it is cleane against kinde, that any should bee so beastlie since (and that is a matter so plaine in itselfe, that all do willingly yeelde vnto it:) so is it against the dignity of our Creation likewise, that we should make the simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude of them, or of any thing els (being therein but our owne creatures) so farre aboue vs, as that we haue done worship vnto them. If hee had some desire before, to haue such a yoke-fellow ioyned vnto him, he being in estate of innocency; then out of it we may gather, that marriage by Nature, and Gods holy ordinance, is so holy in it selfe, that there may bee inclination thereunto, altogether without any staine of sinne.</p>
            <p>Now we come to the thing it selfe, to see how the Woman was first created, and there haue we more specially to cōsider, first of the matter of which it pleased God to make hir: &amp; then, in vvhat sort he made hir therof. In the matter vvherof he made her, vve are to consider, first, vvhat it vvas: and then, hovv it pleased God to take it. It vvas a rib out of <hi>Adams</hi> side, so to occasion their mutuall loue to bee so much the greater. It pleased God in such sort to take it, as neyther might bee any payne
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:7530:17"/> vnto him at that present, neyther yet any want for the time to come: and therefore did he cast him into an heauy sleepe while hee tooke it out; and filled vp the place againe whence it was taken. In what sort he made her thereof, doth occasion vs to consider of some thinges on the part of God: and some others on <hi>Adams</hi> also. On Gods behalfe, we are to consider; first, how he he made her a woman: &amp; then, how he made her his. He made her a Woman, by framing that matter in such sort, vnto <note place="margin">Ibid 22.</note> the vse for which he ordained it, (as that the word importeth) as it were a building of her; so to signifie, that he vsed such workemanship in the making of her, as best might frame her to bee a Yoake-fellow meetest for him. He made her his, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king deliuery of her vnto him when he had made her: an euident token, that mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage by the first institution, is no way stained with any vncleannesse, when as God himselfe doth so ioyne them together; and that such as will looke to finde a bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing in their marriage, had need to reserue themselues onely to such, as it shal please God to bestow vpon them, or whom they may account themselues to haue taken, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> euen as it were of his owne deliuery. On <hi>Adams</hi> part wee are to consider (for the euidency of that worke of God towardes him) how readily, and without any que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stioning at all, as if it were written in his heart before (as indeede it appeareth that so it was) hauing found none a little before, among all those Creatures of God that he could like of, now on the suddaine hath espyed, that in her so soone as euer she is brought vnto him, that he acknowledgeth her to be such, as with whom he may, and ought to bee most inmost of all: and for that mutuall society of theirs, that it should be no breach of duty, nor against kinde, to leaue or breake off from the nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest societies that are (euen of Father and Mother) to keep to his Wife. That speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Mystery, that in this Creation of the Woman is deliuered vnto vs, is concerning the Church, and resteth in two principall pointes: one, who they are that may bee accounted to be of the same; the other, of what hope they may bee towardes God in Iesus Christ.</p>
            <p>Who they are that may account themselues of this company, may soone appear, if by the description of the one, we can frame our iudgement of the other: that is, none other, but such as are raised out of the opened side of Iesus Christ, being cast in a sleepe by his death; or such as rest in him alone, for the whole woorke of theyr Redemption. What hope they may haue towardes God in Christ is euident also, if as <hi>Adam</hi> then acknowledged <hi>Eue,</hi> so Christ likewise shall then acknowledge those that in such sort are brought vnto him, to be so neere and deere vnto him.</p>
            <p n="8">8 How he dealt with Man when thus he had made him, whosoeuer would find, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> he had neede first to consider how wealthily and richly hee placed him: and then, what charge hee gaue vnto him. How wealthy and richly it pleased God to place him, will best appeare, if we consider first of the place that God prouided for him; and then accordingly, how God did place him in it. What the place was that God prouided for him will best appeare, if first we consider of the scite of it; and then how the same was furnished for him. As touching the scite of it, though it bee by <hi>Moses</hi> described, yet it is not so fully agreed on by the learned that haue written thereon, but that as yet some question remaineth, both of the place where it should bee, and of the boundes and limits of it, when once they are agreed on the place. But this is certaine, that it was in <hi>Heden,</hi> a fruitfull and a pleasant Countrey, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> on the East part of it: and by the description that <hi>Moses</hi> vseth, about that place <note place="margin">Gene. 2. 8. 14.</note> where <hi>Babylon</hi> was afterward built, or somewhat beyond; and was very well wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, which in those hotter Countries is of speciall importaunce. But as touching the furniture of it, the Text is plaine, that God had prepared therein whatsoeuer Plants and Trees were meete for sustenance, &amp; most delightfull to the eye besides; and that in that respect it was called a Garden: and that he had therein two speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all trees besides, one of which, was the Tree of Life, in the middest of the Garden; the other, the Tree of Knowledge of good and euill. Which place beeing in this sort prouided, then hauing made him, it pleased him likewise to place him in it: that so he might be possessed of that goodnesse of God tovvardes him, and in the dayly
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:7530:18"/> fruition of it, the more to his comfort behold the same. In the charge that nowe he gaue him withall, we are to consider, first what the charge it selfe was; and then <note place="margin">Gen. 2. 15. 17.</note> what we are to gather out of the same. In the charge it selfe we are likewise to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, in what poynts it resteth, and of what nature it is, for one other matter of spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall importance. The pointes wherein it resteth are two: the one as touching the whole grounde it selfe; the other, as touching one Tree therein. As touching the whole ground it selfe, he was willed to imploy himselfe about it, to dresse it as need should require, and to keepe it (belike) in such order as now it was deliuered vnto him. That which concerned one Tree therein, was, that which was giuen about the Tree of knowledge of good and ill: which in effect was this, That hauing liberty to eat or feed where they would besides, and especially of the Tree of Life, they might in no wise eat of that other that was forbidden; being giuen to vnderstand withall, that whensoeuer they should eat of it, then should they certainly die. Of what na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture this charge of theirs was, for one other matter of speciall importance, is to be considered also: namely, that in those two pointes of their charge, God did not so tie them vnto him, that they could not fall away from him; but onely let them vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand wherein they might please him, and what seruice he required of them: o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise leauing them at their owne free liberty, to chuse them whether they would doe it or not. As also it had left them lesse oportunity, to haue shewed their obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence towards him, if they had beene made so fast vnto him, that they could not haue turned aside though they woulde. Those thinges that we are to gather out of the same, doe partly respect God himselfe, but most of all Man. Those that respect God himselfe, are especially two: one, that he had done maruelous much for man; the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that notwithstanding, he requireth but a small peece of seruice of him. That he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> had done meruelous much for man, appeareth not only in his Creatiō of late, in that he made him so excellent a creature in himselfe, and besides that (vnder him) the head of all the rest; but also, in this his late placing him in so notable a vein, so richly furnished with all things needfull, and so full of delectation besides. That notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing it was but a small peece of seruice that he required of him, will better ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, if we do consider of those braunches of it apart by themselues: and first, of dressing and keeping the Garden; and then, of forbearing of that one Tree that was forbidden. For as touching the dressing and keeping of the Garden, being such as then it was when God had new made it, no doubt the labour must needes bee but small, and was rather an occasion giuen him to go about it, that in the whole and in euery part of it he might (to his singular cōfort) behold the exceeding great goodnes of God towards him, than to be accounted (as labours go now) a labour indeed. For who woulde not of himselfe be desirous of so pleasaunt a place as it, and though it were a great deale meaner, desire to haue the fruition of the whole and of euery part (and glad he might obtaine that fauour) notwithstanding the labour that the place would require to keepe it in order? As touching the Tree that was forbidden, although their liberty was therein so farre restrayned, yet was that no burthen vnto them, but so easie and light, that without any paine they might haue born it, though (for those twoe persons) they had not had the tenth part of that prouision, that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise he had laide open vnto them, euen rounde about them, which way soeuer they turned themselues. Being therefore so good vnto them, and yet requiring so small seruice of them, it might well teach many of vs, not to exact so much as wee do, at the hands of those to whome we haue done some little pleasure. Those things that respect man, are first as touching them both together: and then, as touching either of them apart by themselues. As touching both together, we may note, that when God was purposed to appoint them some spirituall seruice, which was to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare the forbidden Tree, then did he first enioyne vnto them some bodily labour: so (belike) the better to preserue them from transgressing the other. A good argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment vnto vs, that if in the wisedome and goodnesse of God, that bodily exercise were needfull for them, to preserue them from sinne, before that sinne had yet made any entraunce vnto them, then is it much more needfull for vs, after that once sinne hath gotten such hold of vs as nowe it hath; and withall, that such as liue most idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:7530:18"/> or do most of all sequester themselues from all needfull and honest labour, those <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> are by all likely-hood most subiect to sinne; and how faire a shew soeuer they may outwardly beare, yet notwithstanding, of all others the fowlest within. If we come to either of them apart by themselues, then are we first to begin with this bodily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise that it pleased him to enioyne vnto them, and out of it to gather two speciall lessons; One, that if that bodily exercise or labour (such as it was) was enioyned to them, then when as neither they stood in any neede for their bodily sustenance (for themselues or others) nor in any danger of sicknesse, which as yet was not; then is it much more needfull for vs now, when as necessity vrgeth vs thereunto, so much as it doeth, either for the needefull sustenaunce of our selues or others, or else for the health of our own bodies. The other, that if God in <hi>Paradice</hi> would not haue things in so perfect order in euery point, to those also that had yet neuer sinned, but that therein there should be some vse of their owne industrie too; then is it not to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, that there can be any such estate in the world now, that will not need some speciall care to mantaine the same, euen to the godliest men that are. In the other, we are to note somewhat, not only in the prohibition it selfe, but also in such things as go therewithall. In the prohibition it selfe, we are to note, that it is our seruice to God, to forbeare such things as hee forbiddeth; and that as vnto them he forbad but the vse of one Tree onely, and gaue them free liberty ouer all the rest; euen so, now dealeth he with vs also, leauing vnto vs so great plenty of all things needfull in all kindes whatsoeuer, that we neede not to account our selues streightened in any thing that is forbidden vnto vs, but that the corruption of our nature doeth rather incline to that which is forbidden (though it be woorse) than to those things that are left vnto vs, be they neuer so good. Those other things that go therewithall, are diuers: some of them nearer, but one that lyeth somewhat farther off. Those which are nearer, are two; the name of the Tree that was forbidden, and the interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it. By name it was called the Tree of knowledge of good and euill: a daunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous name to allure them vnto it, but that there was prouision made in the interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of it, to preserue from the daunger of it. The interpretation of it, was such, as might plainly shew in what sense it was so called: namely, that if they transgressed, thē should they know by their misery then, how blessed or happy they were before. And this place may be a patern vnto vs, to teach vs what to look for in al the residue of the scriptures besides; namly, that as somwhere there are things darkly set down, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> to exercise the depth of our wittes therein, and to be a iust offense to those that are carelesse of holy things; so are they else-where made so plain likewise, that the sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pler sort may well vnderstand, &amp; all that be careful may be safe enough from all dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of being intangled therein. That one that lyeth somewhat farther off, is the consideration of the Tree of Life: which being the Sacrament of their happy estate by that their Creation, and placed in the middest of the Garden, might very well haue beene a good stay vnto them so to haue continued. For in that it was the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of their happy estate, as they had a feeling of the same within: so was this from God himselfe, an vndoubted testimony of it without. And being in the midst of the Garden, it must needes be much in their eies, which way soeuer they turned themselues, and so more meete to holde them in a speciall good liking of their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent estate, to be thankfull to God for the same: yeelding vs also a profitable les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, how much to esteeme not only of our blessed estate in Christ; but also, both of Christ himselfe (by whome we haue it) and of such Sacraments as he hath left vnto vs, euer to haue them our chiefest delightes, euen in the middest of all our Gardens of ioy and comfort.</p>
            <p n="9">9 What it pleased him to pronounce of the workman-ship of these when he had <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> made them, wee haue deliuered vnto vs; first, particuarly of most of them apart by themselues: and then, generally of all together. Particulerly apart by themselues, it is first pronounced of that one, that serued to take away one speciall blemmish that was on the whole Masse before: and then, on most of the residue, that serued to the perfecting of the worke that was in hand. In that it was pronounced of that one
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:7530:19"/> that serued to take away a speciall blemmish that was on the whole Masse before, <note place="margin">Genesis 1, 4.</note> (namely the Light) we may note, that it was not good to be in darkenesse; and so consequently, that it is a thing vnnaturall, that diuers doe so much loue darknes as they doe in most of their waies; Then also, that the inward Light of the trueth is a treasure of great importance, and the ignorance of it maruailous euill. Among those that serued to the perfecting of the woorke that was in hand (being omitted in the second dayes woorke, which was the seperation of the Waters that were aboue, from the Waters that were beneath by the Firmament set betwixt them) it is next of <note place="margin">Gen. 1, 10.</note> all spoken of the diuision of the Waters that were beneath, from the dry Land, so making therby the Sea and the Waters on the one side, and the Earth on the other, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> to appeare and be apart by themselues: and then of the furniture of them. In that it is spoken of that diuision of the Waters and Earth, we are to note, not onely that which ariseth vnto vs, by dayly experience of the benifits that redound vnto vs out <note place="margin">Ibid. 12, 25.</note> of them both, and therein much more then wee can perceiue; but also that those bounds which are set vnto them are clearly the best, and therefore not to be wished of any that there were Land where it is Sea, or that it were Sea where it is Land. In that it is spoken of the Furniture of them; first of those things that haue no sense, both belowe and aboue, and then of those that haue, both of the Sea and of the Earth, wee are to note, that euen from the highest vnto the lowest, and from the greatest vnto the least, they are all to good vse, and not one of them all to be despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, or had in any other account. When it is spoken generally of all together, it is not onely saide, that he did see those things to be good: but also, both that he vie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed and considered of them, that all was maruellous good. Out of which, we are so much the more to settle that resolution in our selues of all the works of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, both for the whole and for euery part of them: as wee see that it is of speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all great force to such a purpose, that his wisedome vppon that viewe, should so giue foorth his iudgement of them.</p>

That one thing that fell out immediatly after, while yet they were but those two onely, was the ruine or Fall of Man (a matter of very speciall im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance:) wherein, first we are to consider how far they departed away from God; and then, how God did (neuerthelesse) beare them speciall fauour. How <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap> they departed away from God, will best appeare, if we consider what was the falt by them committed; and then what euill did thereupon rush in vpon them. In the fault by <note place="margin">Gen. 3: 1-16.</note> them committed, we are to see, not onely what was the transgression it selfe, but also by what meanes it was accomplished. The thing it selfe was, not onely a breach of the commaundement that God did giue them: but also, in a very high degree. A breach of the commandement it was, for that they did eat of the fruite of that Tree which was forbidden. It was in a very high degree, in many great and weighty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects: some, respecting the thing it selfe; others, certaine circumstances thereunto appertaining. Those that respect the thing it selfe, are two: One, that they had liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to eat of all besides; the other, that there was so grieuous a penalty imposed vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the eating of it. Hauing liberty to eat of all besides, it must needs be a great falt in them to stretch out their desires into those bounds that were forbidden; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing so great a penalty imposed thereon, needs must it teach them, both how much they should offend God in doing the same; &amp; how far they should therby endamage thēselues likewise. Both which do necessarily import, that their sin, (in these respects only) was maruelous great. The circumstances that are chiefly to be considered here are two likewise: one, of the time; another, of the persons. The circumstance of the time importeth, that very quickly they did so far transgresse; and (it may be, at least for any thing that we read to the contrary) before they had done any seruice vnto him: but the best probability seemeth to be, that they stoode one whole day and somewhat better, because we haue the story of Gods resting the seauenth day before the story of their Fall, &amp; because the story of some part of their Creatiō is enterlaced therewith. The persons are of two sorts: those that dealt with them; and their own. Those that dealt with them were two: God, &amp; the Serpent. In God, his Maiesty and Goodnes to them was such &amp; so well known vnto them, that they could not do any thing against the praescript that he had set thē, but that therein, though the fact were neuer so smal, yet must they needs grieuously sin. In the Serpent, they could not but <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> see, both that he was but a creature himselfe, and but of base estate besides, in cōpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison of many others. If he were but a creature himself, they then could ow no seruice vnto him, but were to account him to be theirs, and made to their vse. If he were of so base quality besides, in cōparison of many others, then might not they so far be ruled by him, but that thereby they must make their sin to be so much the greater. In their owne person they might likewise behold, both within and without, such things, as would easily make their sin to be very great. Within they might find, both such free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of will, and such graces withall, that the falt must needs be great in them, so to offend: Without, might they finde likewise, that they were so farre aduanced alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, that considering their homely beginning so lately before, they might in no wise preaze further, but that thereby they must staine themselues maruailous fowly. The meanes whereby it was accomplished were these two: Sathans tempting; and their owne yeelding thereunto. In that tempting of Sathan, we are first to consider of the instrumentes that hee vsed vnto it: and then, in what manner hee proceeded therein. The instruments that hee vsed vnto it, were twoe: one, to the Woman, which was the Serpent; and an other, to the Man, which was the Woman.
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:7530:20"/> In vsing of the Serpent vnto the Woman, wee are to note, that whereas the Text it selfe sayth, that hee was the most pregnant of all the other beasts of the fielde that <note place="margin">Gen. 3▪ 1.</note> God had made: first, what instruments they are, that Sathan in such cases will bee readiest to vse; namely, the most ingenious, or such as come neerest vnto it, as the meetest of all for his purpose: then also, that our selues, (if God haue giuen vs anie speciall giftes) are to take heede, that Sathan do not abuse the same to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> of others. The former of which, may teach vs to beware that Sathan do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guile vs, with the wisedome, learning, devotion, humilitie, or austeritie of any, or with anie other excellencie, or good guift whatsoeuer; much lesse with pretences, or where those giftes are in scanter measure, as in the adhaerents of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and all that company in our time: and so the latter may warne vs likewise, that by any such thing in vs, hee deceiue not our selues or others. In that hee vsed the Wom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n her selfe vnto Man, wee may likewise note two things: first, that as Conquerours vse, when they haue subdued any one people or Citty, to make it a meane to bring in others to their subiection; so Sathan likewise, first subduing the Woman vnto him, doth afterward by her, overthrow the Man likewise; then also, that Sathan will abuse (to our hurt) not onely such as are farthest off from vs, but <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> euen those that are neerest also. The manner of proceeding that he vsed herein, was most of all imployed about the Woman: but somewhat also about the Man. In that which was imployed about the Woman, wee are to note, first how he chuseth out the weaker vessell, and then in what sort he dealeth with her. In that he chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth out the weaker vessell, wee are to take heede, first that we be not weake, or that we abide not in our wonted weaknesse, because that so wee shall prouoke Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than to set vpon vs: then also, that wee ever remember where our strength lyeth, which is (to such purpose) in the exercise of his holy word. Experience whereof we haue in al ages, and these dayes of ours in plentifull measure. Sathan by his both pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie whisperers and open gain-sayers, ever lightly imploying himselfe about those that haue least skill in the word of God, or care not for it, and as carefully on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther side auoyding al such as giue themselues vnto it in any good measure, loath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like to leese his time about them: and euen as in those hee readily worketh on that kind of weaknes, so likewise in al others besides, whatsoeuer weaknesse it is that he findeth in them, of that is he ready to take the aduantage the best that he can; and lightly bawketh none others at all, but onely such as hee findeth to bee prepared to encounter with him, and euer standing vpon their garde, that so they may the better be able to resist the assaults that hee shall at any time make upon them. In wat sort he dealeth with the woman, whom he hath in such sort chosen, to the end that wee may the better find, we are first to note, what person it is that hee taketh vpon him; and then, how he playeth his part therein. The person that he taketh vpon him, is of a freind, and one that is carefull of their estate, as comming vnto her for no other cause, but onely to confer with her about the same, and to giue her his best advice. Out of which wee are to gather, first that wee are to take heede of those that are our neerest friends of all, for that Sathan may tempt vs, by them: then also, that som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time profession of friendship and great hostilitie may lodge together in one mans bosome. Vnder the person of a friend how hee playeth his part with her, is set foorth vnto vs in his two seuerall attempts: whereof in the former hee keepeth somewhat aloofe, or holdeth himselfe somewhat farther of; but in the latter he commeth nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer vnto her. In the former, wherein he keepeth himselfe somewhat further off; he doth but aske a question onely: but yet in such sort, as that plainly he sheweth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to be ready to quarrell with that word of God that was giuen vnto them; and couertly also hee doth insinuate, both that God had no good meaning therein to them, and that himselfe doth not take it well that their liberty should be so far re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained. Hee doth plainly shew himselfe to bee ready to quarrell with that word of God that was giuen vnto them, in that he sayth, <hi>Yea hath God sayd,</hi> &amp;c. a speciall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> propertie of him and his, as in these dayes also we daily do find, euer to be quarre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with the word of God; knowing wel inough, that so long as it standeth in credit
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:7530:20"/> with vs, so long he is able to do little against vs, and therefore that first hee must in any wise seeke to discredit the same vnto vs. In that hee dooth couerely insinuate, that God had no good meaning towardes them, and that himselfe did not take it well, that their liberty should be so farre restrained, as thereby we may plainly see, that he went cunningly about his purpose then; so we daily see likewise, that hee goeth about after the same manner to worke with vs, insinuating to inferiors, some hard dealing of their Superiors, and a better care in himselfe, to haue them in bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter estate. But as Fowlers lay not meate in their Scrape for Birdes, nor Fishers so carefully baite their hookes to feede those fowle or fish any fatter, but to pray vpon them: euen so, hath he the self-same meaning in those his fawnings, &amp; none other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise to be esteemed of any. In the latter, wherein he draweth neerer vnto her, hee dealeth likewise more plainly with her; both against that which was their stay, &amp; further to commend this new friendshippe of his vnto them. To ouerthrowe that which was their stay; first, he doth more plainly impeach the credit of that worde of God: &amp; then, he chargeth God himselfe with il-dealing towards them. How far he impeacheth the credite of the worde of God, is not so fully agreed on with all: some being of minde, that he goeth but against the certainty of it; others, that hee did flatly deny it. And experience teacheth, that those that are of that kind among vs, do not onely impeach the certainty of it, as those that say in their hearts, <hi>There is no God;</hi> but also take away the thing it selfe from the vse of the people (as the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haerents of the late Church of <hi>Rome)</hi> that others may the lesse espy the collusion that they vse for their owne aduantage: as also we may learne hence to gather, that such as at first do no more but make question of the word of God, haue it in them, and bring it with them, to deny it too, so soon as they see hope to aduantage them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues thereby. In that part of his speech wherein he chargeth God himselfe, it shal be good, first to consider wherewith he doth charge him: then, what we are more specially to gather out of the same. Of those things wherewith he doth charge him some there are, that he speaketh plainly: some others againe, that he doth but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinuate, and leaueth them to her selfe to gather. Those thinges that hee speaketh plainly, are two: One, that they were towards a better estate, by the help that they might haue of the Tree forbidden; the other, that God himselfe did know it also. Concerning that better estate, that they were toward, by the helpe that they might haue of the Tree forbidden, he doth not onely shew, whereunto they might attain: but also how soon it would be accomplished. To shew wherunto they might attain, by eating of the Tree that was forbidden, he setteth it downe in two speciall braun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> one, that their eies should be opened; the other, that they should bee like to the Gods, knowing good and euil. Both which may seeme to be grounded on the name of the Tree it selfe. For seeing it was called the Tree of knowledge of good &amp; euil, it might seeme very wel, both that their eies should be opened thereby: &amp; that so far, as to haue some knowledge of good and euill, might make any like vnto the Gods (if any such there were, mo then that one, who of late had made them) they might indeede thereby be made somewhat like vnto them. For the speedinesse of the accomplishment of it, he giueth her to vnderstand, that they should not need to tarry for it, but that presently it should be done, euen the selfe-same day. That God himselfe did know it also, he doth not only affirme it, or plainly say it: but also brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth it in for a reason, why so hee dealt with them, as though that his owne secret knowledge of that matter, had bin the cause why he thought good so to keep them vnder. Those things that he did but insinuate, &amp; did but leaue them vnto hir selfe to gather, wer two; one, that God for his part (they might be sure) did mean no better at al vnto them, but to keep them as vnderlings stil: the other, that therefore it was not for thē any lōger to be at his apointment, but now much rather to shift for thē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues. Those things that we are more specially to gather out of the same, are (some of thē) to be gathered out of the whole: &amp; some others againe, out of certain parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars thereunto appertaining. Out of the whol we may gather, that such wil be the practise of satan, &amp; of his Solicitors; both in matters of religion, &amp; in our ciuil estate also: and therfore, that we are euer to take heed vnto them: namely, that in matters
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:7530:21"/> of Religion they discredit not the goodnesse of God so farre vnto vs, as that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they make vs some other way to shift for our selues; and that in our Ciuill estate they doe not draw vs to such dislike of our lawfull Magistrates, or of their gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (though they be somewhat streight) indeed, that wee take occasion thereby to withdraw our selues from their alleageance. Out of the perticulars thereunto ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaining, we may gather likewise, whence it cōmeth to haue a conceit of mo Gods than one, and so to wrest the word of God to a contrary sense; to make that poyson, that is of itselfe a most wholsome foode, as Sathan here did the name that was giuen to the Tree forbidden. For, whereas God had therefore giuen that name vnto it, to make them take heede that they medled not with it (as other wordes of his did plainely import) because that whereas nowe they knew nothing but good, they should then know euill withall, and that in such measure, as that therin they should much better see what good they had before, than euer they found in the thing it self while they had it: Sathan, to make it serue his purpose, would out of it gather, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> there lay such knowledge therein, as whereby they might become like to the Gods. That part of his dealing that was imployed about the Man, was no more but this; that by her he offered some part of the fruite vnto him to eat. Wherein, although it may very well be, that the Woman did it of her selfe alone, without any sollicitation of Sathan vnto it; yet because it may be likewise, that she was stirred vp by Sathan so to do, here it shall be good to consider, first in what sense, or howe far it may be accounted the deede of either of them; and then, what instruction we out of either of these senses may take to our selues. First; it may be ascribed to the Woman, both for that <hi>Adam</hi> himselfe doth afterward lay it vpon her, and her selfe doth take with it likewise: and for that the Text (in this place) nameth none other but her alone. And so it standeth with vs indeed, that after that once we are infected with that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nom of his, then are we sufficient in our selues to infect others therewith, without any further helpe of his. It may be attributed to Sathan likewise, both because that originally it came from him, and himselfe was likeliest to be ready to help forward that which he had already begun, and so earnestly desired to haue effected vnto the full: and because that in diuers places of the Scripture, such woorkes are attributed to him likewise. If in the former sense wee take it, that it was but the Woman her selfe that did it, out of it we may gather, that in that respect also, it is needfull for vs to take heed, that we admit no infection into vs, that thereby we be not the ruin of others: If in the latter, that we hold him out so well as we can from all, for that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing gotten any one (especially if they be of the better sort) he is thereby much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter enabled to subdue others vnto him; and by degrees, euen the strongest of all. In their owne yeelding thereunto, we are first to consider of the Woman: and then, of the Man. In the Woman likewise wee are to consider, that as she was two seuerall times assayed, euen so did she accordingly yeeld: somewhat to the former, but most to the latter. In her yeelding vnto the former, we are also to consider, first, how far she cleaueth vnto God, and then how far she yeeldeth to the Serpent. She cleaueth vnto God in these two: that they had free liberty to eat of all besides; and that God forbad them that other for their owne good also. How farre shee yeelded vnto the Serpents aduice at this first assault, is not a thing so certainely knowne, because her wordes <hi>[least we die]</hi> as they may be taken to import, that then she made some doubt of that which God had set her downe for certainty; namely, that they shoulde cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely die; so they may be also otherwise taken, to signifie no more, but onely to shew what penalty God had set vppon it, if at any time they should meddle with it: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> but yet, that she abode to heare him, and vouchsafed to giue him answere, and that same but in milde and gentle manner, is more plaine, than that it may be denied by any. As for the former, though most of the learned suppose, that therein she began to fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> (and it may be that she did:) yet seeing the Text doth not force vs so to charge her, we may doubt of our warrant if so we do: yet, if so it were that so farre she yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, then out of it may we gather, that shee did very easily yeelde: and that if the Tempter so easily preuayled with her, then, vnlesse (wee take heede) he may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile much more easily with vs now. As touching the latter thence may we plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:7530:21"/> gather, how dangerous a thing it is, no more but onely to giue eare, not onely to that which is plainly euill; but vnto those also, that but call in question any thing that the Lord hath set downe vnto vs: especially, if we shut it vp with some easye answere, and do not scorne against such slye dealings, as best appertaineth vnto a faithfull and zealous defence of the honour and glory of God. For Sathan did yet but aske her the question: and she both abode the hearing of it; and did not giue him any such answere as he deserued, and she at that time full wel and kindly might haue done. In her yeelding vnto the latter, we haue deliuered vnto vs; first, how she did deliberate or consider thereon: and then after, how shee consented there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto. In her deliberation thereon, it is to be noted, first, that she did deliberate on it: then, in what manner she did deliberate on it. In that she did deliberate on it, when as it was so plainely before, and on such penalty forbidden vnto her, we may therein plainly charge her, that now she was much shaken indeed: both in her du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty towards God; and in needfull care of her owne estate. The manner of her deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration was, that setting aside, or not remembering how God had forbidden the same vnto her, she onely considered of the fruite it selfe (but relying therein, as it seemeth vnto that which the Serpent had told her) and therein gathered vnto her selfe certaine allurements, to prouoke her to meddle with it: some to the conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Body; and one other, vnto the contentment of her Minde. Vnto the contentation of her Body, she gathered a couple: One, <hi>That it was good for Meat;</hi> the other, <hi>That it was pleasant to the eye.</hi> That other that tended vnto the further contentation of her minde, was, that she thought it a good fruite also, to encrease her knowledge besides. A wonderfull thing, that beeing in that estate that then she was in (sauing that now shee was shrunke a little from her foundation) these things could be of that reckoning with her, in a thing that was so plainely forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den before, by such an one as did forbid it, and on such peril vnto themselues: and a speciall good warning to vs, that we, in this estate that now we are in, shall bee neuer able to stand against those and such like allurements, vnlesse we take speciall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> good heede to our selues therein; and specially remember, that they do not at any time sooner present themselues to our consideration, but that forthwith wee cast them out againe with all our power, and euer cleaue inseperably to that direction that he by his worde prescribeth vnto vs. Her consenting thereunto, is deliuered in two speciall pointes; One, that shee tooke of the fruite thereof; the other, that shee did eate of it also. Out of both which wee are to gather▪ first a meruailous preposterous iudgement vppon the deliberation aforesaide: then, how daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous a thing it is, eyther to view or but to consider of such allurements. Her resolution or iudgement was preposterous, for that none of the premises, nor all together, which shee tooke in to perswade her selfe thereunto, were any thing comparable to weigh with the least of those other considerations, which shee had to haue kept her from it. How daungerous a thing it is, but to viewe or to consider of such allurements, may sufficiently appeare in this, that she did then ouerthrow her selfe thereby. For, if shee in that estate was so soone ouerthrowne thereby; then is it certaine, that we in this estate of ours, may a great deale sooner vndo our selues by such vnaduised dealing as it: as also experience doth common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly teach, that infinite numbers of people daily miscarry thereby. In <hi>Adams</hi> yeelding thereunto, we haue no more set downe vnto vs, but onely that he also did eat: and so did yeeld his consent so fully thereto, that neither he rebuked her for so far yeil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding; nor stayed himselfe from ioyning with her in so euill an action as it. But if he in that estate of his, did so easily fall to those two branches of great transgression; (one, that he did not reproue her, the other that he did not yet stay himselfe:) it may not be doubted of any of vs, but that in the estate that now we are in, wee shal much more easily, if we take not good heede vnto it, transgresse in them both; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reproouing such transgression in others, nor so much as staying our selues from it neyther.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The euill that heereby rushed in vpon them, was of two sorts; One, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:7530:22"/> of nature to sinne; the other, misery that came in withall. Concerning the corruption of their nature to sinne, seeing it is a matter of so speciall importance, to know howe farre they were corrupted, and one of the principles of our Religion, therefore it shall be needfull, not onely to consider of those perticulars that here are spoken of: but also by them to go somwhat farther in the consideration of their estate in respect thereof, that so wee may see so much the better, what to thinke of ourselues for that matter also. As touching the particulars that here are spoken of, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> most of them doe certainly import great corruption in them: but one there is that doeth not necessarily import the same, but yet notwithstanding may so be taken. Those that certainely import great corruption, wee are to gather partly out of the time, while yet they were alone by themselues: and partly out of that which imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly followed, when God approached and came vnto them. While yet they were alone together; we may very well gather how farre they were corrupted, partly out of that which then they did: but chiefly out of another that was omitted. That which they did, was, that they were busily occupied so to sew Figge-leaues toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <note place="margin">Genesis 3, 7.</note> as that thereby they might be able, so to couer some part of their nakednesse. That which was omitted, was true repentance of their sinne committed: which if they had had, it could not haue beene, but that they would haue imployed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues muc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ore busily about it, which was the greater; than about that other, which was by many degrees the lesser. When God approached, and came vnto them, first they fled him, or shunned his presence: then, when he woulde not leese them so, but called vnto them, and inquired of their sinne, they neither did then acknowledge the same, but each of them laid it off from themselues. In that they fled him, and shunned his presence, it plainely argueth that nowe they were very foule within: and not onely of sinne (for that could not so haue chaced them away from the Phisitian of their soules;) but of sinne vnrepented, which onely maketh the presence of God to be odious and irksome vnto vs. For after that sinne is once setled in vs to our owne good liking, it altereth all our good perswasion of God, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a secret hatred of him: and then ingendereth that feare of him in vs, that maketh vs to account no otherwise of him, then as of a seuere reuenger of our sinnes; and thereupō, when we cannot repent vs of them, doth make likewise both him and his odious vnto vs. Out of which, we may gather by the way, that because this shrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away from God is of euil, we may resolue our selues of the true difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt that feare of God which is good, and that which is euill; the one euer leading vs vnto him, the other euer driuing vs from him: and so consequently, that our late seeking to Saints was of euil, when we sought to send thē to God as spokes-men for vs; for that such our seeking to thē did arise out of one &amp; the self-same fountaine that made vs, though we sent thē, yet to keep our selues far inough from him. In that they did not acknowledge their fin, but each laid it off from themselues, we may therein <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> note diuers good tokens of great corruption that now was in them: some that were cōmon vnto them both; other that were proper to either of them. Those that were cōmon vnto them both, were two: One, that same want that before we noted to be in them: the other, that so readily they lay it from themselues. The want that before we noted to be in them, which was of repentance, or that they were lapt vp in impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitency or hardnes of heart, doth now again shew it selfe to be in thē: for that now, when they had so iust occasion to haue gathered themselues to repentance (by that approaching of God vnto them, and his questioning with them of the cause of that their feare) they neuerthelesse did not suffer themselues to be led vnto it thereby. For the better occasion we haue vnto it, the greater must needs be our impenitency, if ratably we seek not vnto him. That they did so readily lay it off from themselues, it doth more plainly declare, how farre they were from any repentaunce, when as they would not so much as take with the fault that they had made, but altogether put it off from themselues. For, to take with the fault that we haue made, is but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one steppe vnto repentance: and there is much more that belongeth vnto it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides. So that whosoeuer is voyde of the first degree of all, there is no question, but that euery such, must needs be farre from the full accomplishment of it. Those that
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:7530:22"/> were proper to eyther of them, are for either of them one, of much like qualitie: <hi>Adam</hi> laying it vpon the Woman: and the Woman, laying it vpon the Serpent. In <hi>Adams</hi> laying it vpon the Woman, we are to note, that though directly he did lay it indeed but onely on her: yet obliquely, he doth in some part lay it on God like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise. Hee layeth it directly vpon the Woman in so euident and plaine tearmes, that it cannot lie hid vnto any. But yet is it apparent inough that therein also hee doth her great wrong for that although she gaue thereof vnto him, yet hee needed not to haue eaten vnlesse he list, and so was that fault none others but his: and first, for that hee did not reproue her for mouing him vnto it; then also, in consenting vnto her. Obliquelie he doth lay it on God likewise, in that he doth not lay it onely on the Woman, but on the woman that <hi>he ordained to be with him,</hi> committing there in a double fault: first of iniurious charging God so far as he dare; then, of vnthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full peruerting of that goodnes of God in bestowing that Woman on him, to be the cause of that his transgression; whereas himselfe did know, that he had giuen her vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his singular help and comfort. In the Womans laying it vpon the Serpent, we are to note also, that though shee lay it chiefly on him: yet doth shee partly touch God likewise, in that she saith that the Serpent beguiled her, as though God had not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven her wit inough to haue withstood his subtle perswasion. But this also is a double fault in her, both to lay it, where of right she ought not so to haue done (partly for the Serpent, who did no more but moue her vnto it; but chiefly for God, who shee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> knew wel inough, did plainly forbid it:) and so far to infinuate, that it was for none other but onely for that God had not giuen her wit sufficient; whereas indeed shee should rather haue granted, that it was for not vsing well the wit that she had. That one that doth not necessarylie import such evill to be in them, but yet notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <note place="margin">Gen. 3: 20.</note> may so be taken (and lyeth fayrest so to be) doth directly touch but <hi>Adam</hi> one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and is no more but that it is set down of him, that hee called the name of his wife <hi>Chavva, Hevah,</hi> or <hi>Liuing:</hi> and gave in the reason withall, that she was the Mother of all men living. Wherein first we are to consider, in what respect it standeth some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what doubtfull, whether by it he may be charged with sin or not: and then, if hee may, what is the sin that therein he is to be charged withall. The doubtfulnes stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth but onely in this, whether that relation of <hi>Moyses</hi> be in his rightplace or not: whether it bee sorted to the time when it was done; or whether it bee but inserted there as a digression (as in diuers places some other things are, without respect of the proper time thereunto appertaining. For if it bee but a digression, so that the meaning of it is not that then, but at some other time, that that lyeth not so much to his disaduantage, hee did so call her: then it may (much rather) bee, that he might do it in some other sense, and is not therein so farre to be charged. But if thus it bee sorted vnto the place that is due vnto it, then it falleth out, that when God was denouncing heauie thinges against him for his sin, and now was come vnto the sentence of death it selfe (and yet had not done with him neyther, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth by that which followeth) even then, hee gaue this name to his wife: and wee haue, as I take it, no part of the Text, out of which it may bee rather taken to be a digression, then to bee in his proper place. The sinne that then he is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to bee charged withall, is no more, but an euident fruite of great impeniten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie or hardnesse of heart, that hee in the midest of those heauy and grieuous spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, coulde imploy himselfe in that kinde of earthly glorying: and found not that he had much better cause to call her the mother of the dying, then of the liuing. But sure it is, that our selues are pestered with that vanity in so won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull manner, that euen in the middest of the fearefull iudgements of God, and commonly also at the time of our deaths, wee altogether vanish away in such discourses, as altogether sauor (or stinke, much rather) of flesh and blood. If now by these wee goe somewhat farther to the consideration of their estate heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, that wee may somuch the better see, what to thinke of our selues for that matter, out of these may wee gather two speciall lessons that may helpe vs well to iudge rightly of our owne estate therein: One, concerning the sinne that was <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> in them; the other their owne inclination vnto it. Concerning the sin that was in
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:7530:23"/> them, wee may well conceaue, that where wee finde such braunches of it as heere <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> we haue done, there may we account, both the whole body of sinne to be likewise: and that where sinne hath gotten such holde, there hath it bannished all godlinesse also. And as for their owne inclination vnto it, wee doe finde likewise, that when they had sinned they aboad therein: and that so fast, that when good occasion was offered vnto them, to haue sought vnto God, they neuertheles aboad so fast in their fin, and so little endeuoured themselues to get out, that (vnlesse afterward we haue some other Scripture that may otherwise inform vs) it may seem by this, that hauing so sinned, now they were so farre made the seruants to sinne, that they had in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues no motion at all vnto good, but that all that they had was onely to euell.</p>
            <p n="3">3 The misery that came in withall, was some of it such, as came in at the first to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> with their sinne: and some of it such, as afterward was inflicted on them. That which came in at the first together with their sinne, was some part of it such, as doeth concerne the whole: and some of it such, as respecteth but certaine par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars onely. That which doeth concerne the whole, is, that nowe they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to finde what they had done: how blessed an estate they had foolishly loft; and into what miserie they were sodainly faln. Which no doubt, if then they had any <note place="margin">Gen. 3: 7.</note> right feeling thereof, was enough to confound them cleane, and to make them so ill ashamed of themselues, that a thousand deaths might haue beene farre lesse irk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some vnto them. That which respecteth but particulers onely, doeth some part of it keepe but within themselues: but some other againe hath some thing to doe with God besides. That which keepeth but within themselues, resteth in two principall points: Shame, the one; and Folly the other. So ashamed they were now of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, in that nakednesse of theirs, that nowe they found their selues to be in, that though the work-man-shippe of those their bodies was in it selfe meruailous good both in the whole, and in euery part whatsoeuer, according to the vse and measure of it: yet now that excellent work-man-ship of his, is by their owne sin so stained to them, that they are much ashamed of it; euen of the whole generally but then much more of certaine parts of it. An euill that is of greater importance, than is espied of all at the first: for that thereby it commeth to passe, that neither can we glorify God for any thing that we haue, if our selues be ashamed of it; neither can we put foorth our selues to do good with it, so long as we languish in that conceite. Their Folly appeared plainly in this, that they endeuored to couer themselues with so miserable helps as those; hoping with those Fig-tree leaues, to couer that vncleannes of theirs from the all-seeing eies of, God: a folly notwithstanding that is often renued a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> vs, as in many other things besides; so especially with those that either by par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons from sinfull men, or else by those vnperfect good woorkes of themselues or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, hope so to do away their sinnes, that they shall not rise in iudgement against them. That which hath to do with God besides, was that when they heard him ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching, they had no ioy now in his presence: but found it to be so irkesome vnto <note place="margin">Gen. 3: 8.</note> them that now they sought to get out of his sight, and to hide themselues from him. A wonderfull depth of Misery, no doubt: though our selues be not able to see it. For though there were no more but this, that they could not ioy in his presence, yet, as they are in pittifull case, who are so clogged with mallady or cares, that they cannot ioy in their meat &amp; drinke, in kins folk nor frends, nor in any other such earthly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort (which things notwithstanding are as meere trifles as may be, in respect of the other:) much rather must we account it to be a much harder estate without compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison, when any are one way or other so far distempered, that they can haue no ioy in him, that is not onely all ioy in himselfe, and the fulnes of whatsoeuer comfort, not only the earth, but euen the heauens are able to yeeld; but especially vnto those that are distressed, as meat to the hungry, the Phisitian to the sick, or deliuerance to those that are in a grieuous and loathsome imprisonment. But if hereunto may be added, that we not only haue no comfort in him (and then what comfort is else to be had?) but also haue a feare and lothing of him, wel may such an one not be able sometimes to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>nd how miserable he is: but certain it is, that he is in wonderful wretched estate. That part of their misery that was afterward inflicted vpon them, was first that they
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:7530:23"/> were called to a reckning of their doings: then afterward, howe they were punni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed <note place="margin">Gen. 3, 9. 11, 13.</note> for them. In that they were called to a reckoning of their doings, is some part of their misery also, for that when any hath done euell, he had rather a great deale, that it should neuer be called to account, than that there should be farther inquiery of it: yet such a thing, as euer so inseperably followeth after sinne; as that whosoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer committeth the one, he also must looke to come to the other, and may not hope any way to escape it. How afterward they were punnished, may best be found out, if first we consider, what was cast on either of them apart by themselues: then what was cast on them both together. In that which was cast on either of them, we haue first set downe what was cast on the Woman, according as she was the first that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended; then, what was cast on the Man likewise: but in them both we are to note, that as either of them doth most respect the persons of those on whom they are cast, especially the former of them; so neuerthelesse they haue somewhat in them, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the latter of them, that doeth appertaine to the other also. So haue we in ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> of them to consider, first, what belongeth more specially vnto the party to whome it is directed: then what belongeth not onely to it, but in some respect to the other also. In that therefore which is cast vpon the Woman, some things ther<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> be that appertaine to her alone: and one, that belongeth vnto her and her husband together. Those that belong to her alone, are of two sorts: one of them respecteth her bearing of Childeren: the others, her estate towards her husband. That which respectteh her bearing of Children, is, that her sorrowes therein should be multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied: an euident token, not onely, that seeing it is onely God who laid that chas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisement on that Sex, it is he also (and none other) that can take it off, and therefore in that case to be sought vnto; but also, that none can breede any Childeren to God neither, but that they must take great paines therein, and that the harder that this is in respect of the other, the greater paines proportionably it will require. Those that respect her estate towards her husband, are two: but in either of them, as wee haue good lessons that lie more plaine, and are nearer vnto vs; so haue wee some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that lie further from vs, and are not so easily espied of all. The former of them is, that her desire should be to her husband: wherein it is plain, that she should haue <note place="margin">Gen. 3. 16.</note> a sense or feeling of a want in her selfe, and that thereuppon she should leane to her husband (a manifest token of a want in themselues, when as they are faine to haue so speciall dependancie on others;) and a good lesson also, though further off, that such as are of the true Church indeed are priuy to such want in themselues and haue such a sensible feeling of it, that their desire (howsoeuer others content themselues) is euer to Christ. The latter of them is, that she should also be at his commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or in subiection vnto him: Wherein likewise it is very plaine, that subiection and obedience was so cast vppon her, as that she could not seeke to rule, but that thereby both shee must needes withdraw her selfe from the ordinance of God, and might not looke for his blessing neither vpon any such gouernment of hers (which also belongeth vnto all married Women besides;) and a good lesson it is likewise, though it lie somewhat farther off, to helpe to resolue vs in a matter of doubt that troubleth many, concerning the authority of the Church in respect of the worde of God, because it teacheth vs by the anologie of this, that the true Church is, and euer will be vnder the obedience of the word of Christ her husband. Well may an harlot, or some fond presumptuous Dame take vpon her to rule ouer her husband: but an honest Matron will neuer doe it; nor the true Church wheresoeuer it be. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> That one that belongeth vnto her and her husband together, is the paines and tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble they should haue in the bringing vp of their Children. For seeing God had cast that discipline or chasticement on that part of their duty, needes must the Man also be subiect vnto it, because that the course of nature it selfe would make him also to be as carefull about it, as would be the other, and therefore as grieuous vnto him likewise, if it did not well go forward. And whosoeuer they are that would bring vp any to God (as Parents their Childeren; Maisters, their Seruants; the Minister his Flocke; the Lands-lord, his Tenants; the Prince, his Subiects; or one Neighbour another;) they also may looke for none other, but that therein they shall finde a very
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:7530:24"/> painfull and irksome labour. In that likewise that is cast vpon the Man, one thing there is that doth more specially concerne him then her, and yet concerneth her al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so: <note place="margin">Gen. 3: 17-19.</note> and others againe, that concerne them both indifferentlie. That which doth more specially concerne him than her, and yet concerneth her also, is the toile that he should haue with the ground so hardly yeelding, because of the curse that now was cast vpon it, such things as should be needfull for them: a thing that is found in greater measure in the Lords Husbandry; where, not the ground that was accursed, but mans heart for the which that curse was cast vpon it, is to be laboured. That it toucheth the Man more then the Woman, dependeth on this, for that by the abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and naturall disposition that God hath giuē vs, it falleth vnto the lot of the Man, much more then of the Woman, to be occupied in the fields or outen labours; and vnto Women, much more then to men to be about home, and to see to those things that are there to bee done: though <hi>Herodotus</hi> noteth the <hi>Egiptians</hi> of olde to haue taken the cleane contrary course; wherein notwithstanding, either he was deceiued, or they went therein directly against, not onely the doings, but euen the natural dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of all Mankinde generally. It neuerthelesse concerneth the Woman to, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that both she was of necessitie now and then to be imployed about the same, and for that the hardlier it could be won out of the earth, the more must she also be streightned by the same. Those that do concerne them both indifferently, are two: one, a toylesome life in the meane season; the other, mortallity or death in the end. That a toylesome life was in the meane season allotted vnto them, wee are to gather two speciall lessons out of the same: one concerning our duty here; another, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning our hope hereafter. That which concerneth our duty here, is, that seeing God hath cast this discipline vpon vs, we willingly submit our selues vnto it: not seking o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> to maintaine our selues but by our iust and paynfull labour, and not to step aside to some easier course for the paynfulnesse of any labour that doth lie in the way of our calling; and, though wee neede not labour for our owne maintenance, yet that otherwise there is euer so iust occasion offered thereunto, that no body may account that he liueth godly, vnlesse he find himselfe to be vnder this discipline al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so. That which concerneth our hope hereafter, is, that if now wee take vpon vs this toylsome life here, such as is by God himselfe appoynted vnto vs, then there is hope, that hereafter wee shal be free from it: where as otherwise, if here we shun it, then may wee doubt, that wee do but reserue our selues to greater in the world to come. That mortallity or death in the end is appoynted vnto them likewise, it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plieth not onely that last dissolution of the body when it shall be sundred from the Soule, and it selfe resolued into dust againe: but also, al such things as belong there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto, either by the imperfection or distemperature of the Body it selfe; or when thereby it is a burthen and breedeth vexation to the minde likewise. Those that were not directed to eyther of them apart by themselues, but were cast on both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, were two likewise: one, that they were vpbraided by God himselfe with this their follie; the other, that they were expulsed withall from that which hitherto they had enioyed. He vpbraided them with this their follie, that now they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come like to the Gods, knowing good and il: a speach that was, or at least might <note place="margin">Gen. 3, 22.</note> haue bin, exceeding bitter vnto thē both, especially proceeding from God himselfe; but yet to good vse vnto vs, to teach vs to haue a better acount of those good things that God doth giue vs, and not so easily to part with the same, as these our Ancestors at that present did. In that they were expulsed withall frō that which hitherto they had enioyed, we are to consider, first what those things were: and then, in what sort <note place="margin">Gen. 3: 22-24.</note> they were expulsed. Those things were especially two: <hi>Paradice;</hi> and the <hi>Tree of life.</hi> And meete and right it was, that such as now by their own default, were become so miserable, should no longer enioy so blessed a place: that when so they had falne from Life or happy estate, they should bee in like sort depriued of that which was the Sacrament of it. Which may be also the ground of a probable coniecture to vs, that none do now so carelesly absent themselues from the Church, our Paradice heere; nor from the Communion, our Tree of Life: but onely such, as whose Fall, or miserable estate going before, hath by the wonted iustice of God brought vpon <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:7530:24"/> them the like iudgment also; namely, that they should (in secret iustice vnknown vnto them) depriue themselues, some, but only of our <hi>Tree</hi> of <hi>Life,</hi> others, both of it, and of <hi>Paradice</hi> too. In what sort they were expelled thence, is deliuered vnto vs in two prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall parts: one vpon what occasion it was done; the other, how firmly it was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed. The occasion is made to bee, least they should take and eate of the <hi>Tree</hi> of <hi>Life,</hi> and liue for euer; a further vpbraiding them with the misery that nowe they were in by their folly before; the matter being of that nature, as that they were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer likely, not only, not to recouer themselues, but also, not to haue somuch as a mind vnto it. But it is to good vse vnto vs likewise, that so wee may the better see, that if we leaue the way of <hi>Life</hi> that is giuen vnto vs, we should be then as vnlikely as they, any way to helpe our selues againe, or somuch as to haue a desire vnto it. How firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or surely it was performed, appeareth in this, that when they were once put out, then did God place Angells there, with a fiery sword, to keepe the way of the <hi>Tree</hi> of <hi>Life:</hi> giuing vs plainly to vnderstand thereby, that it should be impossible for any to stand by our former integrity; and therefore that we are to cast about for some other way to helpe our selues, so to bring vs the sooner to Christ.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Though Man were thus farre departed from God, yet that God did neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> beare speciall fauour vnto Man; may soone appeare if we consider, first how it pleased him to seeke him out after his fall: then, in what sort hee dealt with him vpon the same. That it pleased him to seeke him out when he was fallen, is an euident <note place="margin">Gen. 3: 9-12.</note> token of his fauour towards him, as a good and carefull Shepheard, seeking out his lost sheepe: a good example for all in such case to do the like; and out of which we may gather likewise, that whē God calleth on vs by his word, leading vs to consider where we are, or in what case we stand, in religion or life, then doth he deale in great mercy with vs, and giueth vs therein a token of his speciall fauour. His further dealing with them vpon the same, is first to finde out what they had done: then, how gently he punisheth the fault, that he findeth them to haue made. To finde out what they haue done, first he dealeth with the Man: but by and by after with the woman also. The effect of his dealing with the Man resteth in two principall points: first, to get his answer of him, then, howe hee goeth no further with him. To get his aunswere of him, hee doth put him in minde of the cause of his misery, that for feare and shame of that his nakednesse, hee ran away, and hid himselfe: namely, that belike he had eaten of the <hi>Tree</hi> that was forbidden. Out of which we may ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther likewise, first, that to put vs in minde of our sin, for which any hand of God may be on vs, is a speciall fauour of God, &amp; not so hardly to be taken, as is the manner of many of vs: then also, that to transgresse the commaundement of God, is lightly the cause of whatsoeuer confusion or misery at any time we fall into. That hauing this <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> answer aforesaid, yet notwithstanding he goeth no further with him, it is a speciall good token of his goodnesse towards him: putting vp so graciously as hee doth, an answer that is so insufficient. For besides that hee doth nothing at all giue foorth any token of true repentance; he further layeth it off on his wife, and partly also on God himselfe, as before is declared: and yet it pleaseth the goodnesse of God, quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to put it vp at his hands. Then comming vnto the woman, on whome the Man <note place="margin">Gen. 3: 13.</note> had laid that fault, he enquireth of her, how she could so farre ouershoote her selfe, as to do it. Whereunto when shee aunswered, that the Serpent beguiled her therein, and so did neither repent her of it, nor take with her fault so as shee should; yet doth God put vp this at her hands also: and in his dealing with her likewise, declareth his goodnesse to be such vnto them, as the impaenitency of neither of them could yet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolish. When he commeth to punish, first he beginneth with the Serpent: and then doth after come vnto them. Beginning with the Serpent, wee are to see, first what was his punishment: then, how they might out of it, gather vndoubted tokens of his goodnesse to them. His punishment rested in two principall points: first in his base <note place="margin">Gen. 3: 14: 15.</note> estate in respect of other creatures; then, in the enmity that should bee betwixt the woman and him. As touching his base estate in respect of other creatures, first it is set

Generally it is set downe, in that it is devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to bee the most accursed of all Cattle, and of all the beasts of the field: more speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, in that it must but creepe on the ground (and may not bee allowed either wings to fly, or legs to goe;) and must haue but the dust or refuse of the earth to bee his meate. As touching the enmity that should bee betwixt them, first it is set downe that so it should bee, and not only betwixt the parties that then were, but also betwixt their seede for euer: then, as touching the euent or successe thereof, that it should e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer haue the worse, the Seede of the Woman bruising a sunder his head; and his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ede neuer getting power to doe any more, but onely to bruise the heele of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. That out of this punishment of the Serpent, them-selues might gather vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted tokens of his fauour towards them, is a thing more plaine, then that there may bee any question of it: first, out of the whole generally, then also, out of the consideration of the seuerall parts more specially. It appeareth out of the whole generally, for that God punisheth the Serpent for their sakes, for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> that hee was the instrument of their ouerthrow: and let all such take heede, as suffer them-selues to bee made any instrument of hurt or offence to any of those whome GOD doth fauour. As the Father can hardly abide to see the knife where-withall his Childe was slayne: so can God so-much more hardly put vp any such dealing to those that are his, that often ere this hee hath powred foorth his wrath in great measure on those that haue suffered them-selues to bee so a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bused; euen from the basest sort that are, vnto the highest, and from seuerall men vnto whole Citties and Kingdomes. Out of the consideration of the seuerall parts more specially, the arguments of his goodnesse that doe arise, doe some of them come out of that abasing of his: and some agayne, out of the enmity that should bee betwixt them. Out of his abasing they had proofe inough of it, not onely in that he was so abased: but also in the particulars of it. That he was so abased, may shew it, for that God would allowe him no better; after that Mankinde was by his meanes ouerthrowne: a sufficient warning to others also, that if they suffer them-selues to bee abused to the hurt of others, they may not thinke much, if what-soeuer they were before, they bee after-ward made but abiects for it. In that hee must but creepe on his belly (as not allowed either wings to fly, or legs to goe) and feede but of the dust of the earth, they might see, that both hee had compassed him in with a disability after-ward to doe anie great hurt: and that hee allowed him the meanest or homeliest feeding of all. In that hee did so compasse him in with such disability to doe much hurt any more, they might see howe much hee was displeased with that which was done alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die: and all such as bee of that kinde may learne, that if needes they will bee doeing hurt to any of his, they may not thinke much, if after-ward there be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken such order with them, as that though the naughtinesse of their will remaineth, yet they haue not abillity or meanes to perfourme it. In that hee was allowed no better feeding, they might gather out of the same, in what reckoning he was now with GOD: and an other poynt also that lyeth more hid, but of spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall good comfort when it is founde. That by the feeding hee was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, they might finde him now to bee but in small reckoning with God, for that the others were allowed a better feeding (as of liuing creatures, or the growth of the earth) and hee but the homelyest of all others, as the most abiect of all others in the house of God. That other poynt that lyeth more hid, but yet is of speciall comfort when it is found, is, that out of that homelie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> feeding they might haue gathered, though not a certainty yet notwithstanding a probable coniecture, who they were that should bee the Serpents meate hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: namely, none of those beloved of his, or that are sealed by him to eternall life; but onely those that are of lesse account with him, and will not receiue the loue of the trueth being offered vnto them. Out of the enmity that so it pleased him to set betwixt them, not only themselues might gather such tokens of his goodnes
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:7530:25"/> towards them then: but wee also may gather other lessons besides, as meete for vs now. To begin with them, it is certaine that they might gather the same partly out of the emnitie it selfe: but especially out of the harde successe that the Serpent should haue therein. In the emnitie it selfe they might plainly see, that God had now accursed his whole dealing that was betwixt them, with perpetuall hostilitie on both sides: that the Serpent for all his fained friendship then, should euer haue the seede of Man his mortall enimie; and Man-kind likewise, notwithstanding that now the woman had yeelded vnto him, in a matter of so great a moment, to the vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ouerthrow of them-selues and theirs, yet should they haue euer all that genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (which now, reason would, should haue pittied them rather, or at least haue done them no more hurt, as hauing done them to much alreadie) set on a mortall hatred against them. In which as they may plainly see an euident token of the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of God towards them in that hee so punisheth the Serpents deceauing of the Woman with the hatred of them and theirs: so might they see likewise, if they did but a little marke it, that God rewarding the Womans facilitie, with the hatred of all that kinde to her and hers, did therein also plainly declare his goodnes towards them, giuing them now to vnderstand thereby what the Serpent and his seede should bee vnto them, that is, their enimies, and of a sufficient warning vnto them; and prouiding thereby a needfull exercise for them besides. In that harde successe that the Serpent should haue therein, they might better finde it because the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage is so plainlie giuen to the Seede of the Woman: and although in that les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser power that is giuen to the Seede of the Serpent, the matter may seeme to bee some-what eclipsed; yet euen that also being better considred, is not without some speciall good comfort. In the advantage that is giuen to the Seede of the Woman, to bruise in-sunder the Serpents head, the more welcome a thing that it is vnto any, that hath any mortall or deadly enimie, to bee able to tread him vnder his foote when-soeuer hee will, the more may they finde therein an vndoubted token of the speciall fauour of God towards them, that then did giue them assurance of so speciall aduauntage against that mortall enimie of theirs. And although as yet it was farre to the full accomplishment of it, for that it was to bee performed onely by <hi>Christ,</hi> and that in many ages after that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> promise then to come: yet, because God is true, and cannot faile in whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer hee hath promised, the more assured that they might bee of it, in time to haue it fully performed, the more comfort might they haue euen in that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so; and yet in the meane season might account besides, that both they and theirs should euer haue such power against the Serpent and all that kinde as by the letter lay neerest vnto their vnderstanding, and daily experience it selfe would teach them. That in that lesser power that is giuen to the Serpent and to his seede, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Woman and her seede also, they might see good tokens of the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of God, first it is cleare, if then they had that knowledge of <hi>Christ</hi> and were better able to apply it to him: and, if they had not that, yet might they otherwise finde it also. If they had that knowledge of <hi>Christ,</hi> and could right-ly apply it to him, then could they not otherwise take it but of the Man-hoode of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> and that it was the Heele against which <hi>Sathan</hi> should haue that power: and then could they not but see withall, the inestimable benefit that out of the same should redound vnto all generally. If they had not that knowledge of <hi>Christ,</hi> yet that otherwise they might finde it also, euen in that lesser hurt that the Seede of the Serpent should doe them, is plaine inough likewise, first in that hee hath some power ouer them: then, that it is no greater then so. In that hee hath some power over them, they might well accout it both a needfull chastisement for their so ready yeelding vnto him before: and as needfull an exercise also for the time to come, to make thē more wary how they haue any dealing with him. In that it was no greater then so, and had no power allowed him ouer the principal parts of the body, but was restrained only to the Heele, so farre from the heart, it is plaine likewise, that hee being so mortall an enimy would haue made choise of some other part much rather, on which to haue wreaked the malice he had, then on a part so far frō deadly danger as it, if he had not
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:7530:26"/> bin for their sakes restrained by the speciall hand or power of God. Those other lessons that wee may gather besides out of the same, are all about that division or variance that commonly haunteth the Church of God, and euer standeth betwixt the children of the world on the one side; and them, on the other: whereof some of them are to our instruction; and some, to our comfort. To our instruction it is, that such enmitie is of God, and euer to bee found betwixt the children of the world on the one side, and the godlier sort on the other: and therefore that none are to take offence thereat, as though neither part could haue the trueth, so long as they haue such variance with the other. To our comfort it is, that the issue of that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention shalbe so comfortable to the godlier sort: that the seede of the Serpent shal annoy them but in the heele; and they, in the power of their strong Redeemer, shal readily goe to the head of the others, and there giue them a deadly wound. Then <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> comming to the parties that had offended, and to the chastisements that were cast vpon them, therein may they see the great fauour of God likewise: and first, in them <note place="margin">

                  </gap>-21.</note> all taken together; then, in euery of them apart by them-selues. In them all gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally they might note, that none of them all, not all together, were any thing cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondent vnto the sinne that they had committed to bee any iust punishment of it, but that it came short of the same: then, that if somuch of their iust desert were remitted vnto them, or at the least not imposed on them, needs must it bee of some speciall fauour that God did beare them; and that certainly there was, in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret counsell of God, some attonement meant vnto them or else that in iustice God could neuer haue dealt so easily with them. If wee come to consider of euery of them apart by them-selues, wee are first to begin with those that God did cast on either of them seuerally: then, to those that hee did cast on them both together in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently. Of those that God did cast on either of them seuerally, wee are first to come to those that were cast on the womā: thē, vnto those that were cast on the Man. In those that were cast upon the Woman, they might see the fauour of God remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, first, in those her paines in child-bearing: then also in that other, which was of her subiection vnto her husband. Her paines in child-bearing would make her to loue her children better: and bee some stay vnto her besides from such inordinate wantonnesse, as otherwise might bee diuers waies hurtfull vnto her: Her subiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to her husband must needs bee a benefit, if there bee in the Man (as, for the most part, it is) better gouernment, then in the Woman. In those that were cast vpon the Man, first wee see that for the time wee are heere, labour is a preseruation of the bodie in health, and of the Soule from sinne likewise: and that a toylsome life here, or any kinde of griefe whatsoeuer, doth helpe very well to make vs weary of this our <hi>Pilgrimage,</hi> and to couet that Country of ours that is for euer. And our dissolution in the end, is a blessed thing, for that it helpeth vs away hence, that wee tarry not here still, till the world be as weary of vs, as wee of it: especially, when as by making them garments hee both declared himselfe to haue care of their necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in the meane season; and that hee, and he only it is, who both doth make those garments for vs (euen out of the death of <hi>Iesus Christ)</hi> whereby wee stand cloathed before God, and teacheth vs also to put them on by faith in him. In those that hee cast on them both together, it appeareth plainly likewise, for that though hee cast <note place="margin">G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

But first, wee haue certaine things of them deliuered vnto vs that are of a lower consideration: then, those others, that are of that speciall matter of greater account. Those things <note place="margin">Gen. 4: 1-2.</note> that are deliuered of them, which are of lower consideration, are two: one, of their birth; another, of their kinde of life. Of their birth, we haue no more set downe, but that first they had <hi>Kaine,</hi> and that his mother did so call him, as a man obtei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of the Lord: and afterwards had <hi>Abell</hi> also. Of their kinde of life it is said, that <hi>Abell</hi> gaue himselfe to tend cattle; and <hi>Kaine</hi> to the tilling of the ground: neither of them liuing idely, <hi>Kaine</hi> though a bad one, yet in that kinde being well imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and <hi>Abell,</hi> though of better hope, yet not thereon sequestring himselfe from the other. Those other things that are of that greater consideration will occasion vs, first to consider of the story of them thereunto appertaining: then, to gather out of the same what patternes we haue in them, both of nature and grace: the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of them thereunto appertaining, doth first treat of their worshipping of God: and then, of certaine other things that fell out thereupon. As touching their wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping of God, wee are to consider, first what was done on their parts towards him: then, how far he accepted of it. That which was done on their parts towards <note place="margin">Gen. 4: 3-5.</note> him, was, that after many daies they both came to worship: <hi>Kaine</hi> bringing his oblation of the fruites of the ground; and <hi>Abell</hi> his, of the first breed of his flocke, and the fattest of them. When these were thus offered to God, it pleased him to haue regard vnto <hi>Abell,</hi> and to his offering: but not vnto <hi>Kaine,</hi> nor vnto his. Those other things that fell out thereupon, do all, most appertaine to the story of <hi>Kaine</hi> (but so notwithstanding, that there is some mention of <hi>Abell</hi> also:) and first, about the present griefe that then he tooke, for that God accepted of his brothers oblati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and not of his; then, about the slaughter of his brother thereupon. Concerning that present griefe of his, we haue declared, first that he was angry therewith: then, how the Lord dealt with him about it. That he was angry therewith, it is very plain for that it is said, that he was exceeding wroth, and that his countenance abated or fel withal. Whē the Lord dealeth with him about the same, first he inquireth of him why so he doth: and then, vseth some reasons to quiet him againe. He inquireth of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> him what reason he hath, either for that inward perturbation of his mind, or for that <note place="margin">Ibid. 6, 7.</note> outward demonstration thereof in his countenance, or hanging-looke. The reasons that he vseth to quiet him withall, are two: one, of the equitie that in him he should find; the other, that there was no cause in his brother to the contrary, but that he might quiet himselfe towards him. Concerning the equity that in him he should find, he doth plainly giue him to vnderstād, that he is ready both graciously to accept of any thing that he should do well: and to lay to his charge whatsoeuer it is that he should do il. That there was no cause why he should be grieued against his brother, he sheweth likewise, both that his brother did bear a good dutiful affectiō towards him: &amp; that he should be his inferior also. Concerning the slaughter of his brother thereon, we haue described vnto vs, first how he committed the fact: then, how God dealt with him about the same. In his committing of the fact we are to consider, first <note place="margin">Ibid. 8, 9.</note> what moued him vnto it: thē, in what sort he did perform it. That which moued him vnto it, was nothing else but that which goeth before: namely, that God accepted of his brothers oblation; but then as touching his own, he did not onely not regard it, but, when hee was abashed at it, did also reproue him for the same. The manner
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:7530:27"/> Wherein hee did performe it, is deliuered vnto vs in two principall poynts: one, that hee spake peaceably vnto his brother: dissembling the secret ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e that he bare him; the other, that hauing him abroad in the fields, he suddainly fell vpon him and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ue him. The dealing that God had with him about it, was first but onelie to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> of him where hee was: but then, all the residue about the chastisement that God thought good to cast vpon him for the same. In his inquiring for him wee are to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, first how mildely God doth aske him for him: then, what an vngracious and wicked answere hee returneth to God againe. The mildenesse and goodnesse of God appeareth therein, first, for that hee did not roughly storme against him as hee had deserued: then also, both that hee did aske where hee was, and that hee asked the same of him, who knew well inough what hee had done with him. The naughtinesse of his answere appeareth in this likewise: both that hee did flatlie ly vnto him, in that hee denied to know where hee was; and that hee asked of God withall, whether hee was his brothers keeper. Concerning the chastisement that God thought good to cast vpon him for the same, wee are to consider, first how it was imposed of God: then, how it was taken by him. As it was imposed of God, wee finde that though it were but small in respect of that which hee had deserued: yet when hee founde some fault with it, it was something eased vnto him. So are wee first to consider what it was in it selfe: then, how farre it was eased vnto him. In denouncing the chastisement it selfe that was cast vpon him, first hee laieth his sinne before him: and then sheweth him; what must be his portion for it. He lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <note place="margin">Gen. 4: 10-12.</note> downe his sinne before him, first but generally: then, more specially. Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally when hee doth it, hee addeth an admiration withall; as when hee saith, what hast thou done? so to giue him to vnderstand, that he had committed a fact of spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall detestation; and the better to quicken him vp vnto some due consideration of it. More specially hee sheweth what it was, when hee telleth him that the voice of his brothers blood cryed vnto him out of the earth: so giuing him to vnderstand, not onely that hee knew well inough what he had done; but also, both that blood in such sort spilt doth cry to the Lord, and that hee is ready to hearken vnto it. The portion that for this his sinne hee must haue, is likewise set downe vnto him, first generally: then, more specially. Generally he giueth him to vnderstand that he must stand accursed for it. More specially both he doth <note n="a" place="margin">I doe not finde that hee goeth any further but onely to insinuate it because the speech is but vnperfect, as in such case▪ oft times it is: because that the Hebrew Accent which they call <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

When hee doth insinuate his abandoning thence, he seemeth also to make it his reason, that the earth had ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned her mouth and receiued from his handes the blood of his brother, that he so vnnaturally had shed forth vpon it. The hardnes of his estate else-where hee is giuen to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand should partly arise vnto him out of the earth: and partly should cleaue to his owne person, or for euer hang thereupon all his life long. That part of it that should arise vnto him out of the earth, was, that when hee should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowe his labour to till the ground, it should not yeeld him fruites correspondent. That which should cleaue to his owne person, and all his life-long hang vpon him, was, that hee should bee, not onely a Fugitiue one the face of the earth, euer wandering to and fro: but also (as it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, by the nature of both those words that are vsed, and as some of the learned do gather, whereunto his owne words immediately following so plainly bewraying a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall feare, may giue some inducement) infested, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually pricked with a troubled minde, by the guilte of that foule fact of his.

               </gap>ame vnto him, was the complaint that thereon hee made: first complaining of that whole punishment of his generally; then, of the seuerall partes or members of it. Of the whole punishment hee complaineth, that it was greater then he was able to beare: which hee coulde in no wise thinke, but that both hee must make ouer-light of his owne sinne; and somewhat charge God with iniustice also. In his complaint of the seuerall partes of his punishment, first hee complaineth of that which he now had lost: then, of that estate wherein now hee was to be. Of that which nowe he had lost, he reckoneth two speciall benefits: One, the same Countrie of his, from which he sayth that God now doth driue him; the other, his gracious countenance from which hee sayth that now hee shalbee hidden. In that estate wherein hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forward hee findeth that hee must bee, he complaineth of two speciall discommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities: one, that hee must bee such a forlorne Fugitiue on the face of the earth; the other, that it would come to passe, that (being in such disgrace as hee was with God) whosoeuer should finde him, he also would kill him. The mitigation of that his punishment, which hereby hee obtayned, was but onely concerning that feare that hee had, that whosoeuer should finde him, would slay him: and for it, or to ease him therein, hee had both a speciall iudgement sette downe against any that should so doe, namely to bee punished seauen-folde more, then <hi>Kaine</hi> yet was for the murther of <hi>Abell;</hi> and a marke set vpon him, for his protection on that behalfe. How this punishment was taken by him, it may sufficiently appeare, in that hee did thereupon depart from the presence of God, and so wandred vp and downe as a Fugitiue, in some of those Countries on the East of <hi>Eden:</hi> nothing at all seeking the fauor of God, though by that his late complaint hee had found, how ready he was to haue done him good, if himselfe had sought the same at his hands.</p>
            <p n="2">2. What patterns now wee haue in them, both of nature and grace, to the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> end that wee may the better finde, as they are two seuerall things, and deliuered vnto vs in these two persons, so are wee to consider of either of them apart by them selues: and therefore first to begin with <hi>Kaine;</hi> then after, to come vnto <hi>Abell.</hi> As touching <hi>Kaine,</hi> out of whole story wee are to gather what wee are by Nature (who was the first that euer was borne, and therefore somuch the meeter to shew vs what wee may thinke of our selues for that matter) though some things we see that were commendable in him; yet for the residue, all was reproueable. Commendable it was, first that hee gaue himselfe to labour the ground: then also, that hee had some Religion in him, such as it was. In that hee laboured the ground, though he might haue done it in a greedie desire (considering how plentifull things were then that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> grew of themselues, while yet they were so very few; and so he be charged by some of the learned) yet is there no question, but that hee might doe it in good manner also: and then, wee knowing nothing to the contrarie, sure it is that wee are to iudge the best of euery one. Neuerthelesse if hee did it out of a greedie desire, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny way ill, then haue we a pattern in him, that though Husbandry or tillage it selfe bee good, yet may the children of the world follow it ill: as also there is no questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but that they doe, and so haue the light that is in them to be but darknesse, to the greater conuincing of their darknesse to be exceeding great. If hee did not any way follow it ill, then out of it may wee gather likewise, that such as are bad men towards God, may neuerthelesse imploy themselues well to the vse of themselues and others, in such things as belong to this present life. That hee had some religion in him, it doth plainly appeare, both in that he worshipped: and in that hee wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped so as hee did. In that hee worshipped wee may plainly see, that a kind of worshipping may bee in men: and yet themselues starke naught notwithstanding. In the manner of his worship it appeareth likewise, both that hee worshipped the true God: and that hee came not emptie, but brought with him such things as hee had, or wherewith God had blessed his labour. Out of which wee may in like sort gather, that those poynts also may be in such as otherwise are of a reprobate course, and not one iot better then <hi>Kaine</hi> himselfe. Reproueable bee was, first euen in his
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:7530:28"/> worshipping it selfe, the chiefest flower of all his garland: then also, much more in other his dealings that ensued thereon. That in his worshipping hee was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proueable, it may plainely appeare, both by some things that we finde in God: and out of the consideration of his owne nature also. Those thinges that wee find in God for that matter, are two: one that he did not accept of that his worshipping; the other, the reason that himselfe doth giue of his so doing. That hee doth not accept of it, though it bee no vndoubted argument in it selfe, because some-times hee vseth so to deale with his children also, not accepting their seeking to him at the first: yet is it a speciall good likelihoode, that some way or other his worship was wrong, seeing that then, euen at the first, God did plainly refuse to take it. The reason that hee giueth of his so doing, doth make the matter cleane out of question: for that hee doth a little after so plainely tell him, that if hee had done well, hee would then haue taken it of him. Out of the consideration of his owne nature wee may gather it also, for that before wee found it to bee so corrupt in <hi>Adam</hi> himselfe, that now we might not looke for any true good to come of this his first begotten: because that finding all things to engender like to them-selues euen that onely consideration may iustly with-hold vs from expecting any other in this. Those other dealings of his that ensued thereon, were of two sorts, as we <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> saw before: some of them concerning that present griefe that he conceiued, about the acceptation of his brothers oblation, and the reiecting of his; the others, about the slaughter of his brother that hee thereupon in his minde conceiued and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward performed also. In that his griefe that so hee conceiued wee are to note, not only that it boded a maruelous ill nature, to bee so angry as he was: but also, that it argued no repentance in him. It must needs boade a maruelous ill nature in him to be so angry as he was: for that hee was so angry with God himselfe: and that for no iust cause at all; hauing also not so much as any semblance of iust cause for any the least iot at al of that his anger. It argued also no repentance in him, for that his anger growing on the non-acceptance of that his worshipping, did thereby plainly bewray, that the pride of his heart was such as that hee thought very well of that his worshipping, though hee sawe that God did make no reckoning of it: whereas, if there had bin any repentance in him, he would haue had that lowlines of mind as that, though God had accepted neuer so well of it, yet would he haue thought so meanly of it, that it would haue grieued him nothing at all, if God had made no reckoning of it. In the slaughter of his brother, we may perceiue it, first, if wee goe no further, but only to the fact it selfe: but then much more, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider of what behauiour hee was towards God, when he dealt with him about the same. In the fact it selfe wee are to consider, what it was in the nature of it: and in what manner hee did performe it. The fact it selfe, was in the nature of it, hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible murther: and committed, not only when yet there were few in all the world; but also vpon his owne brother. Vnto the manner of it, do appertaine two speciall considerations: one, that hee had no cause at all why hee should so doe, neither was himselfe carried with any other, but onely that God, not respecting his sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, did neuerthelesse accept of his brothers; the other, that to compasse his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the better, hee vsed deepe dissimulation, couering the mischiefe that was in his heart, with a pretense of no other meaning, but only of such as might well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come one brother to haue towards another. In his behauiour towards God, wee may plainly see, that he did nothing repent him of it, no not in the presence of God, and when hee was called to a reckoning for him: and, on the other side, that so long as hee hoped hee might keepe it close, hee both denied that hee knewe any thing of him, and did plainly professe besides, that hee accounted not himselfe to haue any charge of him; and when he saw that it was espied, and now had some punishment cast vpon him for the same, hee both accounted that easy punishment of his to bee ouer-great (bewraying a speciall feare that now he had of all things besides) and withall turned aside from God, nothing at all seeking to him for the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> forgiuenesse of that his sinne, nor for any other fauour besides. Out of which, wee also may gather for our selues, that as wee are naturall men, wee haue no religion
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:7530:28"/> or deuotion wherewith to worship, but such as God may not accept of; and that neuerthelesse wee are so well perswaded of it, that wee also can easily be angry if he doe not accept thereof asmuch as if it were sound in deede: that for that only cause wee conceiue mallice against our bretheren, whose profession wee find by the word of God to bee approued; and neuer leaue (if God will permit somuch vnto vs) vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till that vnder pretence of brother-hoode, wee haue imbrued our selues in their blood: that neuerthelesse wee will not be acknowne of it, nor in any wise take with the same, so long as any way wee can put it of, and account our selues likewise no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all to stand charged with them: that wee also make so light of our fault therein, that how little soeuer wee bee punished for it, yet wee account it a great deale to much: and that hauing so euident testimony both of the iustice and mercie of God wee also make no reckoning of either, but turne vs aside we care not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, so wee may but seeme to our selues that after a sort wee are gotten out of his presence. And where these things are, there may wee be sure, there is somuch ill besides, as that we may assure our selues, there is nothing at all that can be thought on, but that by nature wee are stayned with it likewise.</p>
            <p n="3">3 As touching <hi>Abell,</hi> in whome wee are to search out (as before I shewed) what many of vs are by Grace, there bee but two speciall matters therein to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> the one his worshipping of God; the other, what he suffered of <hi>Kaine</hi> his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. In his worshipping of God, wee are to note, that it pleased God to accept thereof: and so consequently, that without all question there was made some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation in the secret purpose of God; and that it is not vnlikely neither, but that, one way or other, <hi>Abell</hi> was directed how to worship God aright. That with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all question there was made some reconciliation in the secret purpose of God, it is most euident, not only because the scriptures declare the same, but also for that the iustice of God is such, as that otherwise none might looke for at his hands, that hee should so farre approoue any so base workes of ours. For although that <hi>Abell</hi> might then haue worshipped, both for the substaunce of that his worshipping, as God required, and for the manner, both sincerely and zealously also, so far as then (after the fall) could be found in man: yet of necessiity needs must it be so far short of that measure or weight that God requireth, that but in mercy hee might in no wife haue accepted of it; and then must his iustice some way or other first bee satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, before his mercy might extend it selfe so far vnto any. That one way or other <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
               <hi>Abell</hi> was directed to worship God aright, is not vnlikely, for that it pleaseth him, for the most part, so to worke with those that are his: and yet it may bee otherwise also, namely, that hee worshipped no better then <hi>Kaine,</hi> it may be worse, and yet in respect of the reconcilation made, he might sauorably accept of a worse of him, then hee reiected at the hands of the other. For so is it with those that are his heere in this life: both that hee directeth them ofttimes to worship him according to his word in some measure; and yet, that at their hands he accepteth oft-times likewise, much fainter and meaner seruice, then he reiecteth of many others. So that by the vertue of that reconciliation we also may hope, that our worship and seruice to him shalbee accepted: and yet, that wee glory not therein, as though it were for the worthinesse of it, wee are to knowe withall, that oft-times hee reiecteth much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of others; or at least may so doe, for any thing that wee can haue to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. In that which hee suffered for his brother, wee are to note, what cause himselfe did giue thereof; and how his brother wrought thereupon: and, in either of them, to apply the same vnto our selues. The cause that <hi>Abell</hi> gaue to his brother was none at all, but that his brother was of so ill disposition, as that hee tooke occasion thereat, though none was iustly giuen by him. For he did no more but worship the Lord, as also <hi>Kaine</hi> his brother did: and it may bee, that hee worshipped him (as touching the worship it selfe) nothing better then <hi>Kaine</hi> did. But certaine it is, that it pleased God to accept of his, and not of his brothers; which was the thing whereat he was grieued: and so consequently leaueth vnto vs, that <hi>Abell</hi> did giue no cause at all. That which <hi>Kaine</hi> did neuerthelesse worke thereupon, resteth in two
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:7530:29"/> principall poynts: one, that hee was grieued with his brother; the other that hee murthered him also. Out of both which wee also may learne, that which daily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience teacheth, that euer there is a race in the world, so dieply smitted with that bad disposition of <hi>Kaine,</hi> that they also rage against their bretheren, and imbrue themselues in their blood, for none other cause, but only for that they find, that the profession or religion of those their bretheren doth stand approoued by the Word of God, when their own is by it reiected: the only cause, why in these daies also the adhaerents of the late Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> do so bend them-selues against all those that more sincerely professe the Gospell of <hi>Christ.</hi> In which quarrell though the better sort bee put to the worse heere, and daily spend their blood therein: yet such is the retribution in the end, that well may this also bee deemed a speciall blessing that by grace is cast vpon those, to whome by his goodnesse it is allotted.</p>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>h</hi> the first from him in lineall descent. That which was about <hi>Chanok</hi> his first begotten, was, that after hee had a Sonne hee then began to builde a Citty, and called the same, after the name of that Sonne of his, <hi>Chanok.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, as before in diuers others, so in this also hee hath yeelded himselfe a right pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne of the Children of the world, as in one thing that commonly haunteth the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of all, and is more tollerable: so in some others that are more reprooueable. That one thing that commonly haunteth the nature of all, and is more tollerable, is the common care that Parents haue for their Children to leaue vnto them so well as they can: whereof wee haue some patterne heere in that wee read not of any care that hee had of building, vntill hee had a Sonne; but hauing a Sonne, then not only hee builded, but hee would builde a Citty also, more a great deale then hee should neede. Those others that are more reprooueable, are two: one, that is open inough of it selfe; another that is not so easily espied of all. That which is open inough of it selfe, is, that hee seemed to haue a desier to aeternise so much as he could the name of his Sonne, or to leaue it to all posterities that were to come: a kind of vanitie, that sitteth neere to flesh and blood, and can hardly be sundred from the wisest and godliest that are. That which is not so easily espied of all, is that now he beginneth to settle himselfe in a stayed place, or at least doth labour the same; whereas alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die hee knew well inough that God had inflicted this chastisement on him, that still he should wander on the face of the earth, for that his vnnaturall and wicked deede: nothing at all (in any good remorse of conscience) submitting himselfe to that hand of God; but striuing against it, and labouring to crosse it so much as he could. But as we haue no mention or knowledge of it since (which also might be by the flood which after ensued) so may wee the rather think, that God did crosse that purpose of his, and held him vnder the execution of that his former sentence in a wandering estate, and so would not suffer him to enioy a quiet setling of himselfe in any such building. Those that concerne <hi>Lamech,</hi> the first from him in lineall descent, doe partly respect that present time, when the story beginneth to record any part of his <note place="margin">Gen. 4: 19-24.</note> doings: and partly the time that afterward followed. That which respecteth that present time when the story beginneth to record any part of his doings, was, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> hee first corrupted wedlok, in that hee tooke him two wiues, first of any others that wee doe reade of: a matter that is of that nature, as that though it well become
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:7530:29"/> that first beginner of it, to haue descended of so gracelesse a line; yet so plausible vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the corrupt nature of all, that afterward it rested not there, but proceeded further and smitted many of the principall Fathers in the Church it selfe. So perilous a thing it is for any, to begin any kinde of ill whatsoeuer. Of those things that respect the time that afterward followed, one of them doth concerne his Childeren: and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther importeth, that as hee had first corrupted Wed-locke, so was hee afterward ill troubled with it. That which doeth concerne his Children, is, that God notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing did specially blesse them: and not onely the Sonnes of his former Wife, with whome it seemeth his marriage was without reproose; but also the Childeren of his latter, the one of them cleerely, the other also in the iudgement of some. The speciall blessing that was bestowed on the Sonnes of the former, was of inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: by <hi>Iabal</hi> the elder, of well ordering of Cattle, and of the trade thereunto ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaining; by <hi>Iubal</hi> the younger, of certaine instruments of Musicke, by the string, and winde, as the Harpe, and the Organ. The Childeren of the latter were two likewise: a sonne that was called <hi>Tubal-Caine;</hi> and a daughter that was called <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hamah.</hi> On the Sonne the text is plaine, that there was a speciall blessing of inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion bestowed likewise: namely, of working of Brasse, and Iron, and applying the same to our vse. On the daughter also, by her name it may seeme, that there was some speciall beauty bestowed, because that so in the Hebrew toung her name doth signifie. But because it could not vsually so soone be seene, whether shee would proue to be so answerable vnto that name (at least if that name were so timely giuen her) therefore on her part it importeth no more, but that in her childe-hoode there were some good tokens in her of some special beauty: and on theirs that did so name her, that beauty was with them as also with vs, a speciall ornament vnto a Woman. And so may we see that on the Childeren of either of these two wiues of his, there was a much like blessing bestowed: namely on either of them onetthat appertained to needfull vse, as vpon <hi>Iabal</hi> of the one, and <hi>Tubal-Came</hi> of the other; and on ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them another that tended chiefly to delectation, as vpon <hi>Iubal</hi> the inuention of Musicke, and vpon this <hi>Nahamah</hi> that speciall beauty. That which importeth, <note place="margin">Tremel. Inn.</note> or at least may so seeme, that as hee was the first that corrupted Wed-locke, so was hee afterward ill troubled with it, is that same speech that hee had vnto his Wiues: concerning which we are to note, both what it was; and at what time it proceeded <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> from him. What the speech was that he had vnto them (as touching the sense or meaning of it) is not yet resolued among the learned: but it may seeme (and that is the iudgement of some) that he did not therein speake of any such slaughters as hee had already committed, as many imagine (especially of the Iewes:) but rather that he did vaunt forth himselfe, what he were both able as yet and willing also to doe, if he were therunto prouoked. And because that he doth so specially direct his speech therein to his Wiues, it is not vnlikely, but that their contentions and ill dealing with him, did make him so to breake forth vnto those menacing speaches: and so declare as it may seeme, that himselfe found some trouble now, in taking a couple of Wiues vnto him; pulling vnto him (as the Prouerbe is) more with one hand thereby, than now he was able to put of with both. As touching the time, when this speech pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from him, by order of the text it seemeth to be after that his Childeren by them were come to mans state or to ripe yeares already (because it seemeth by the order of the story, that they had inuented those things before) and so consequently most likely to be in the old or declining age of <hi>Lamech;</hi> at which time he might be indeed more likely to find cumber in such case, somewhat answerable in proportion to that, whereunto his own inordinate lust in the flower of his yeares had prickt him before: a needfull document to others also, so to moderate the lusts of their youth, that in such case they doe not onely consider, what would best fitte their inclination then, but also how it will fit them after; least that while in the former they omit the latter, they afterward be cloyed with the fruites of the former, and now do find ten times more griefe, than euer they had contentment before, notwithstanding that then with brags and crackes they face out that weake declining cause of theirs so well as they can.</p>

Out of which we may gather, both that God is wont to make supply, whensoeuer any are in such case destroyed: and that our selues likewise may looke for the same at his hands, that though tyrants rage neuer somuch; yet God will euer so make supply that still there shalbe a seede among vs. That which followeth imediately after the birth of <hi>Enos</hi> his sonne, is a matter of greater difficulty, for that it is of two diuers and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie readings: the greatest part of the learned, both of old, and of this present age of ours, reading it one way, namely, that then (that is, in his time) men began to call on the name of the Lord, or that the name of the Lord began then to bee called vpon: others, of old and nowe also, of speciall account for learning likewise, reading it cleane otherwise, namely, that then the name of the Lord began to bee profaned in calling thereon, or in the worshippe that was done vnto it. For as touching that of the <hi>Septuagint,</hi> that did reade, that <hi>this man</hi> (that is, <hi>Enosh) did hope to call on the name of the Lord,</hi> and such others as goe that way to worke, giuing to <hi>Enosh</hi> that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation, besides that in the first part they plainly swerue from the original, in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that <hi>Enosh</hi> did it, in the residue also they ioyne with the former, and so are in effect (for the matter thot now wee speake of) all one together with it. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore concerning these two, it shalbee good so to consider of either of them, as that wee may the better see in what sense it may best bee taken: whether, that then the name of the Lord began to be called vpon; or else, then beganne to bee among men <hi>profaned.</hi> As touching both which, there is no question, but that the former hath many mo partakers, then hath the latter: but yet notwithstanding it seemeth to me, that the latter is not to be despised neither. For though the former doth ouercome <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> in number of iudgements: yet the matter seemeth to haue the Texte it selfe somuch the more to incline to it then vnto the other, that those iudgements of theirs may so much the rather be called in question. Which that it may the better appeare, and that a readier way therewith all may be made to iudge betwixt them, it shall be good (as I said) to consider of either of them apart by themselues: both howe farre they are supported in the iudgements of men; and how they stand in the Text it selfe. And first as touching the former of them, not onely most of the <hi>Hebrews</hi> of olde, but the <hi>Fathers</hi> likewise, and most of the learned now, do so take it (and that sense is a great part of the ground-woorke of those notable Bookes of <hi>S. Augustine</hi> of the Citty of
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:7530:30"/> God especially for certaine of them:) and in <hi>Plantines</hi> Epitome of <hi>Pagnines Hebrew Lexicon</hi> the other signification of the word is so cleane left out, that thereby it may seeme, that those learned that hee professeth himselfe to haue vsed in gathering of it, were then of opinion that no such sense was due vnto it. But if we come to the Text it selfe, then, besides that in diuers other places it doth so signifie (and so of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity must, the circumstances of those places requiring the same) wee haue other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise the principall matter wanting that should be for that sense of theirs; and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what besides, that seemeth to stand some-what strong against it. That which is wanting in the Text, to confirme that sense of theirs, is, that no where wee haue any mention at all of any such Church or Congregation of faithfull or godly people in in those dayes, that either now or at any time else (before the calling of <hi>Abraham)</hi> were any way assembled together to the worship of God. Some there were, who shortly after were called the Children of God, who (we may thinke) were the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter sort among them; and no doubt there were some speciall persons in both those lines (not only of <hi>Seth,</hi> but of <hi>Kaine</hi> also) whose hearts it pleased God to touch with some speciall feare of him: but yet we reade it not so reported, that wee may safely conceaue that there was, not only not any one such people, but also not somuch as any one family (or but one silly couple of any one family till wee come to <hi>Noah)</hi> that professed the feare of God; but only some fewe seuerall persons, here and there one without any fellowes. And then, if otherwise wee cannot finde any thing that importeth any such company, needes must wee haue somuch the lesse helpe for rhe warrant of that sense aforesaid. That which we haue in the Text against it, is partly in this place: and partly elsewhere. In this place, somewhat there is in the poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting or distinguishing of the sentence going before: and some-what in the whole course of the matter it selfe, before, and after. That which is in the poynting of the sentence going before, is, that it is shut vp from this member that followeth, with one of the Kings or principall sorts of the Hebrewe distinctions: which (though some of the learned do otherwise) yet <hi>Arias Montanus</hi> maketh a full distinction. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> And then if it be a full distinction (as in that place by nature it may seeme to be) the more liberty that therein there is, to refer it vnto the Story of the whole Chapter go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before, or to the Story that after followeth; somuch the lesse must be the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity, of tying it onely to that, which next and imediately goeth before it. But then, whereas the most of the Chapter treateth of <hi>Kaine</hi> and his line, and giueth good cause to suspect corruption by them; and but very little of it, of <hi>Seth</hi> and <hi>Enos,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise reporteth no goodnes of them: hence must it follow, that as if it bee refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto the whole, then it should rather imply <hi>profaning;</hi> so if it be referred but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the latter and lesse part of it, yet there also it findeth not any ground-woorke of true <hi>Inuocation.</hi> In the whole course of the matter it selfe, before &amp; after, both in this Chapter it is said, that <hi>Kaine</hi> and <hi>Abell</hi> came with their oblations to God (and then was not this the first woorke, that of that kinde was done by any) and a little after, where the whole Genealogy or line is set downe, besides that, there is no such com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation giuen to either of them, that so special recital of the Line of <hi>Adam</hi> there, doth as it were set by (as before I noted) whatsoeuer was gon before, as not worthy of any such special commendation. Else-where also, namely in the <hi>Epistle</hi> to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> where the <hi>Apostle</hi> maketh a diligent, and a speciall good recitall of the godly Fathers of old, especially such as were most auncient, there he altogether o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth this, and passeth imediately from <hi>Abell</hi> to <hi>Enok:</hi> whereas notwithstanding in this sense that now is giuen it, it had made specially to his purpose; and therefore most likely, that seeing hee did omit it, (hee for his part) did not so take it. Which things considered, it were somuch the more hard to conceaue, why <hi>Iunius</hi> should now returne vnto that former course againe, after that <hi>Tremellius</hi> in these dayes of <note place="margin">Fra. Iunius. Iun. Tremelius.</note> ours had so well broken the Ice vnto him, and himselfe had ioyned with him therein, but that being so much giuen to that new platforme of Church-gouernment, that in these late dayes hath ben so vehemently vrged by diuers, it is lesse maruaile, if there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he were somuch the readier to incline to this sense, as on that occasion in diuers other places also he is, in such like cases. As touching the latter, certaine it is, that in
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:7530:31"/> voices it is nothing so strong as the former: but yet such as may seeme, to haue the Text more fauourable, then hath the other. As for voices, I knowe no moe but those <hi>Hebrews</hi> of old: and a couple of these daies of ours (but those, as I take it, of speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all good account) <hi>Tremellius</hi> abroad, and a countriman of our owne at home. But then comming vnto the Text, wee see that immediately after (the first Chapter one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">Mr. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 word">

Which great corruption imediately following might seeme much rather to shew, that this place might speake of the beginning of it, and so bee a Transition vnto it (but that so many of the Learned doe otherwise take it) then to speake of any such speciall Inuocation of God to bee then begun, of which wee finde nothing else-where besides: and as though, they had degenerated before, and now were called backe vnto it againe; whereas it was but onely 235. yeares then, since that <hi>Adam</hi> himselfe was made.</p>

               <hi>Seth,</hi> are of two sorts: some of them gathered out of the whole; others, out of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> some speciall persons. Out of the whole wee may note, both that one Line is spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially pursued: and that the time is diligently noted withall. In that one Line that is so specially pursued wee may note, both that according as the promise was made of the Seede of the Woman that should bruise in sunder the Serpents head, so there was giuen a good hope vnto them for the perfourmance of it, when they sawe that Line so carefully continued: and that seeing none other is (to speake of) set downe besides, of them, therefore there is lesse account to bee made; especially in comparison of the other. In that reckoning of the time, wee may note likewise, not only that while they were fewe, God did giue them the longer life, that so the world might so much the sooner be replenished: but also, that as afterward it would helpe well to direct the people of God to their promised Sauiour, and to many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther matters of good importance besides; so it was not of any to bee neglected, seeing that heere it is so carefully obserued. Those speciall persons out of which we are to note somewhat more specially, are two: <hi>Enock</hi> and <hi>Noah.</hi> Of <hi>Enock</hi> we haue two things noted: one, of his godly disposition; the other, of a speciall reward that it pleased God to bestow vpon him. Concerning which, we are first to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der somewhat of either apart by themselues: and somewhat of them both ioyned together. Taking them apart by themselues, and first beginning with his godly disposition, some things there are, that lie plaine inough vnto all: but one thing there is, that yet I finde not to bee noted by any. Those that lie plaine inough vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all, are of two sorts: some that doe appertaine vnto all; and one that doth more specially belong to certaine of vs. Those that doe appertaine vnto all, are two: one that hee was godly disposed: the other, how long hee did continue therein. That hee was godly disposed, wee are first to see how it appeareth: then, what speciall point of godlinesse is ascribed vnto him. It appeareth in this, that heere it is said, that he walked with God, and else-where this his walking with God is termed to <note place="margin">Heb. 11: 5.</note> be pleasing of him: A good example for al to follow, to withdrawe our selues from <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> the common course of the world, and to frame our selues to walke with God. That speciall point of godlinesse that is ascribed vnto him, is that hee rebuked the vngod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of his time (as <hi>S. Iude</hi> recordeth) and freely denounced the heauy iudgements of <note place="margin">Iud. 14: 15.</note> God against them. His continuance herein is noted to bee three hundred yeares: a long and a wearisome time no doubt, to see so much iniquity as hee did, and that hee in reproouing the same was on all hands (as no doubt hee was) so little regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. That one thing that doth more specially belong to certaine of vs, is, that he is noted withall, to haue begotten diuers Children, as well as others: whereby it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pereth, that the estate and vse of matrimony doth not hinder, but that therein men may sincerely walke with God; and so consequently, that wedlocke is not to bee so
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:7530:31"/> far abandoned from holy orders, as some haue beene perswaded of it. That other thing that I finde not as yet to bee noted by any, is, that although this <hi>Henock</hi> bee but only in the fixt descent from <hi>Adam</hi> (or the seauenth from him, as <hi>S. Iude</hi> doth terme him, reckoning then <hi>Adam</hi> for one:) yet is he the first, vnto whome the Text hath yet giuen that commendation; at least by name. For as touching <hi>Abell,</hi> though afterward we haue good commendation of him (Christ himselfe calling <note place="margin">Mat. 23: 35. Heb. 11. 4.</note> him righteous, and the <hi>Apostle</hi> attributing faith vnto him) yet in this place we haue no such thing of him, but onely that hee worshipped (which is said of his Brother also) and that it pleased God to accept thereof, which as it was not for any goodnes in him, so likewise it might haue beene, though in him there had beene no goodnes at all. And as for that other reading of most men, that <hi>Then men began to call on the Name of the Lord,</hi> neither is that commendation giuen vnto any by name: neither is that (as I doe take it) the sense of the place, as before is declared; or at least, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that diuers of the Learned both old and newe, doe not so take it, but in an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther contrary sense, therefore is not it to stand as vndoubted to any. The reward that was bestowed vpon him, was, that he did not taste of death as others did, but was taken vp of God: wherein, as hee was vouchsafed a rare praerogatiue, so to bee exempted from the common course of others, in so speciall a matter as it; so is it a comfortable example to all, to see that godlinesse is so deare and welcome to God, as by the reward that heere at this time hee bestowed on <hi>Enock,</hi> we may finde that it is. If now we take them both together, then are there two notes besides, that comfortably we may gather out of the same: one, that lyeth reasonable plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; another, that doth more hardly follow. That which lieth reasonable plainely, is, that seeing there was at that time such an vniting of that godly disposition of the one, and so speciall acceptance of the other, as in such case wee may looke for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> the like: so wee may not sunder them neither; but if wee will expect the latter, wee must then awayt the same in the way of the former. That which doth more hardly follow, is a collection that diuers do gather out of other such like places as this (as out of the seauenth daies rest, and out of the freelege of the seauenth, and fiftie yeares; out of the compassing of <hi>Ierico,</hi> and such like) and some out of this likewise, or at least somewhat towards it: namely, that (omitting▪ curiously to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of the secrets of God, or by such things as at the most are but meerly coniectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, to set down a certainty or likelyhoode either, and considering onely in all such cases, but of possibilities, and of them no further neither, but as may stir vs vp to godlinesse within the bounds of Christian sobriety) it may very well bee, that fiue thousand yeares of the world being spent already, and the better halfe of the sixt like-wise, as true righteousnesse is now, by the power of the Gospell, so begun to bee restored againe, that many doe walke with God nowe that followed the course of the world before; so may the time be very neere, wherein the power of death shall cease, and the faithfull bee taken vp to eternall glory, and that as in this Story hee that liued longest of all the Fathers which was <hi>Methusalem,</hi> did imediately follow after him that walked with God, which was <hi>Enock</hi> his Father (for that some doe rather giue that honour to <hi>Adam,</hi> it is by adding vnto his yeares so many moe, as were inough to giue him the victory in that matter, instead of his infancy and youth, that he should haue liued by the common course of others of that age be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee came to that ripenesse of yeares wherein God first made him; and not that hee liued so many indeed:) so may that eternity that wee now speake of, follow as neere vnto this our walking with God, that the power of his woord doth now set vp on earth among vs. Of <hi>Noah</hi> wee haue nothing to this place appertaining, but only concerning the name that was giuen him, and the prophetical interpretation of the same: namely, that he should comfort them or giue thē rest concerning the labour &amp; trauel of their hands on the earth which God had cursed. Of the which, though the difficulty of the place hath bred diuers interpretations, yet I maruaile that that which seemeth to bee the onely sense of it, is so generally missed of all that yet I haue seene, both old, and new. For it is not to bee doubted, but that sith <hi>Moses</hi> maketh so speciall mention of it, but that some matter of speciall importance
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:7530:32"/> doth lie therein: both of greater importance, then a readier course in husbandry; and neerer to the marke, then by that generall destruction of all that fell in his time, to giue the better sort rest from their labours that they had with the wicked. Namely, that seeing it is the manner of the Scripture, when it giueth foorth any personall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentation of <hi>Christ</hi> that was the promised Seede, or bringeth foorth any, in some thing or other to represent the person of him before hee came (as <hi>Iosuah,</hi> in bringing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> in the people into the promised rest; <hi>Sampson</hi> in his inuincible strength; <hi>Dauid,</hi> in his reiection for a time, but afterward attaining by degrees vnto the Kingdome, <hi>Salomon,</hi> in his owne wisdome, and in the happy estate of his Kingdome; and diuers other such like) thē but so to point to those patterns, that although thereby it raise vs vp to a good and comfortable expectation, yet doth it not leaue vs there, but pointeth vs farther to looke for the residue, and for the full accomplishment of all, in some other that was to come: euen so in this also may wee very well think, that whereas <hi>Noah</hi> was likewise a figure of <hi>Christ,</hi> both in preseruation of those that were saued from the flood, and in the Couenant that with them was made, these woordes of <hi>Lameck</hi> his Father, doe so point to that peece of comfort or rest, that it pleased God by that meanes to deriue to others by him, that neuerthe-lesse they send vs further for the further accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them, vnto him whome hee represented, <hi>Iesus Christ;</hi> in whome wee knowe, that from God to Man is deriued, the fulnesse of all quietnesse and comfort, and in none other but onely in him.</p>
            <p n="4">4 As touching the whole race of Man generally, both of these that are last men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> and of the others going before, whereas it pleased God, vtterly almost to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy them all, the Story first treateth of that generall destruction of all: then, of those that after succeeded, vntill the time that he chose (from among them all) one peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar people vnto himselfe. Concerning that generall destruction of all, first we haue the <note place="margin">Gen. 6: 1-4.</note> cause of it set downe vnto vs: then, that iudgement of God it selfe. The cause of it is alleadged to be the great corruption that then was among them: concerning which, first we haue one thing noted as the occasion of a great part of that their corruption; then that their corruption it selfe. So are we first to consider of that occasion: then, of that corruption it selfe. In the occasion of it, as there is some thing set downe so plaine that there is no question of it: so is there somewhat againe that is not so plaine, but that therein the learned are of diuers iudgements. That which is set downe so plaine, that there is no question of it, neuerthelesse is not so cleare in it selfe, but that some doubt may thereof arise: and so are we first to consider of the thing it selfe that now we speake of; then of that doubt that thence may arise. The thing it selfe that now we speake of, is, that euen the better sort of them, had so little care of their owne abiding in their better course, or of leauing a godly seede behinde them, that for beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties sake they matched with the looser sort: and so did both themselues degenerate; and left a mungerell seed behinde them. A faire warning to all that followed, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly how euill a counsellour the desire of beauty is in matters of marriage: but also, that so many as haue care of their childeren, to haue them brought vp in the feare of God, had need so to waine themselues from desire of beauty in choice of their Wiues, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> for it they doe not match with those that by their owne carelesnesse on that behalfe, doe before hand giue sufficient proofe, that they would but little regard it in their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deren also. The doubt that hence may arise, is, whether we may thinke that God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed more beauty on the daughters of those men that were of the looser sort: than on the daughters of those that feared God. Concerning which, we neede not to think that God bestowed those ornaments of nature, as comelines and beauty, more on the one sort than on the other; but that he bestowed those indifferently, and alike on all: but that the looser sort tooke to themselues more liberty to trim vp themselues, to the eye of flesh and bloud, in apparrell, haire, iewels and such like (as the manner of the world euer is) than the godlier sort did; and that so, and none otherwise, they were more viewly, and pleased the eye of flesh and bloud, more than the others, that more carefully kept within the bounds of better sobriety. That which is not set downe so plain, but that there is (euen with the learned) some question of it, is concerning those
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:7530:32"/> that most of out Translations tearme the Giants. But whereas the word doth also sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie such as reuolt, go backe, or fall away; it seemeth to me, that such as so tooke it, haue the circumstances of the Text more to fauour that sense of the word in this place, than those that take it in the other: because that by those intemperate and vnaduised matches that the better sort (for beauties sake) made with the looser, much better oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion was giuen to speak of <hi>Apostates,</hi> or such as abandoned all godlinesse then, than of men outgrowne in stature; and so much the rather, for that in the Text it seemeth to be reported chiefly of those, that were of greatest account among the rest. For the greater that any doe grow vp among others here in this world, the more doe they in such matters forget themselues, and him too that maketh them great, if the grace of God be not the greater with them. In the discription of the corruption it selfe we are to note, first how great it was said to be: then, how the Lord was moued at it. In the <note place="margin">Gen. 6: 5-7.</note> greatnesse of it, it shall be good to note, not onely how farre they were faln then: but also, what light is thereby giuen vnto all, howe to finde what wee also are by nature. How farre they were falne then, is plainly set downe, when it is said, <hi>That all the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations of their heart were onely euill continually.</hi> The light that thereby we haue giuen vs, to finde what we also are by nature, euen all generally, is, that thereby wee are conuinced to be starck naught: and that we haue at all no goodnesse in vs. For if all the thoughts of our hearts be <hi>onely euill,</hi> then, not onely, no one of our thoughts is excepted; but also there is no good concurring with it: and if it be so <hi>euer</hi> likewise, then can there be no time pickt out, when we are not so farre steyned. How the lord was greeued with that foule vniuersall corruption of all, is set downe vnto vs, both in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> one speciall speech that himselfe did vtter thereof; and in some other things that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses did report of him concerning the same. That one speciall speech that God himselfe vttered thereof, was, that his Spirit was driuen to contend with them about the same: which needs must argue, that the corruption was very great, when as to vtter the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignity of it, we are giuen to vnderstand, that the most patient Spirit of God, was dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to contend with them about it. Those other things that Moses reporteth of him concerning the same, are two: one, that he repented and was grieued, that hee had made Man: the other, that withall he vttered himselfe to haue taken this purpose, that now therefore he would destroy both man himselfe, and all thinges else besides that were made to his vse on the face of the earth. Both which being neuer so little consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, do plainly imply, that the corruption was maruellous great, that could breede (as it were,) such a griefe in him, and procure from his so vnspeakable goodnesse, so heauie a iudgement. In that iudgement it selfe that it pleased God to bring vppon <note place="margin">Gen. 6: 8-16.</note> them for the same, we are to consider, first how it pleased him to prouide for those whome hee would spare: then, how hee brought that fearefull destruction on all the rest. In his preseruing of those that he meant to spare, we are first to consider of the Story it selfe: then what we may gather out of the same. In the Story it selfe we haue deliuered vnto vs, who they were whome it pleased God to saue: and howe it pleased him to saue them. As touching the former of these two, they were but <hi>Noah</hi> and his family (nor, by likely-hood, all those neither) no moe but himselfe and his wife, his three Sons, and their Wiues also; eight persons in all: and a certaine number of the creatures of the earth withall, where with to begin the world againe. How it pleased him to saue them, wee haue set downe in two principall points: one, what occasion he tooke thereunto; the other, by what meanes hee would doe it. The occasion that hee tooke thereunto, was his owne fauour towards him: and the integrity of <hi>Noah</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe. As touching the former, it is saide, that <hi>Noah</hi> found grace or fauour in the eies of the Lord: out of which cheifly needes must it come, that hee was so well preserued. As touching the latter, both it is said that he was iust, and without intermission walked with God: and that same integrity of his is afterward giuen in as an occasion (or some <note place="margin">Ibid. 7: 1.</note> part of it) whereupon it pleased him to deale so graciously with him. In the means whereby hee would saue them, we are to consider both howe God affoorded the same vnto them: and how those that should bee saued thereby, tooke vnto them the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of it. How God affoorded the same vnto them, appeareth in this, both that he wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him to prouide or builde a Vessell that might brooke the waters, and otherwise be
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:7530:33"/> meete to such a purpose: and taught him also how to make it. Those that should be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> saued thereby, did all take vnto themselues the benefit of it; but diuersly: <hi>Noah,</hi> both by making of it as God appointed, and by entring thereinto when hee had made it; all the others (both the people themselues for ought that we knowe, and the other creatures) but onely by entering thereinto when the time was come that required the same. That which wee may gather out of this story of their preseruation, doth most of it arise vnto vs out of that gracious dealing of GOD: but some part also, out of <hi>Noahs</hi> behauiour therein. Those things that we are to gather out of that his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious dealing, do some of them arise out of it selfe, without any other consideration: but one there is that ariseth out of an other consideration ioyned withall. Those that arise but out of it selfe, without any other consideration, are two: one, that before hee would cast foorth his wrath on those that hee would destroy, hee did first prouide for the safety of those whome it pleased him to saue: a comfortable example to those that in any imminent danger, for some speciall corruption or sinne, doe truly repent and seeke vnto God; that how-soeuer God will indeed powre foorth his wrath on those sinners, euen to the full, yet will hee euer remember those that are his, and neuer faile first to prouide such safety for them that no part of that wrath shal any way touch them; the other, that hee gaue that guift vnto those that hee would saue (not onely to <hi>Noah</hi> himselfe, but also to those that were with him, and to the other creatures besides) all to drawe vnto that refuge that was prouided, and to enter in vnto it: a good pattern like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise of that gracious woorking of his, in all those whome hee hath ordained to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life, or to any other speciall blessing heere, to take holde of the meanes that are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, and to enter into the fruition thereof; which many others, other-wise as wise as they and wiser too, do much neglect, euen to the astonishment oft-times of so many as behould the same. That one which ariseth out of another consideration withall, is much like vnto that which wee noted before in <hi>Enock.</hi> For as hee being the first that by vndoubted certainty had commendation of speciall godlinesse in this Text giuen him, had also the first honour of a speciall reward thereupon bestowed vpon him: euen so this <hi>Noah</hi> being the next, hee also is vouch safed the next honour of that kinde, and that same in very great measure; that therein hee should sustaine the person of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour that was to come, and that in him the race of Mankinde should yet endure and grow againe to a blessed increase. That which ariseth out of <hi>Noahs</hi> behauiour there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, is, that out of that notable faith that was in him, hee imployed himselfe to prouide the meane that God appointed, neuer leauing till hee had made that Vessell that was prescribed: which no doubt hee could neuer doe, but with some speciall assaults with himselfe, which his owne weakenesse would minister vnto him; and many discoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gings, mockings, and tauntings of the profaner sort of his time, as professing himselfe to bee more wise and to see further then all the rest, and so buisily prouiding, that on dry land hee were not drowned. As also in these dayes of ours, if any so feare the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> threatnings of the worde of God (which indeede are sure in their time to bee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fourmed) that to auoid the danger thereof, they nowe begin while they haue time, to make innouation of their former waies, and to leaue the troden path wherein they were woont to walke before: as they could not do it but with great conflicts euen in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, so were they sure to haue much discouragement by others also; as fearing much more then they neede to doe, hauing so mercifull a God as wee haue, and ouer care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully prouiding for help, where is (in the iudgement of all the rest) no daunger at all.</p>
            <p n="5">5 How hee brought that fearefull destruction on all the rest, that we may the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter not onely perceiue, but also applie to our owne vse, it shalbee good for vs (in this <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 6: 17-22 7: 1-24.</note> also) first to consider of the story it selfe: then, what we are to gather out of the same. In the story it selfe, it shall bee good to consider, not onely of such things as are plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly set downe, but of some others also that wee may account to bee imployed therein. Those that are plainely set downe, are two: one, that sheweth what was done; the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the time thereunto appertaining. That which was done, was, that God so vnlo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the fountaines of the earth, and so opened the windowes or water-fals of the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:7530:33"/> heauens, and so brought in such abundance of water vpon the earth, that thereby hee destroyed both man and beast, worme and fowle, whatsoeuer breathed on the face of the earth (sauing onely those that were in the <hi>Arke)</hi> and so mightily increased the waters thereof, that they were fifteene cubits higher then the highest hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s that they had. The time when this Flood was brought in vpon them, was, when <hi>Noah</hi> was 600. yeares old, when the world had now stood 1656 yeares: and it continued one whole yeare and ten daies, from the time that <hi>Noah</hi> went into the <hi>Arke</hi> for his defence against the same, and then came foorth out of it againe, when the earth was dried, and meete for the vse of those that should inhabit the same. Those that may seeme to be implied doe concerne either all generally: or more specially certaine of them. Those that concerne all generally, are two: one that it is not vnlikely, but that many others began now to be sorry that they had not been better aduised, and now to seeke how to helpe themselues so well as they could; the other, that yet notwithstanding now they found no helpe at all, neither in the <hi>Arke</hi> it selfe, nor any way else. That it is not vnlikely but that many others began now both to bee sorry for the present distresses wherein they were falne, and to seeke for help, it may bee conceiued out of the common nature of man: and out of the time that they had thereunto. For the nature of man is such, that although they haue not any true repentance of their sin; yet are they sorry whensoeuer they finde themselues thereby to bee brought into any danger: and then, though not in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> respect of their sinne, as it was offensiue to God, yet in respect of the euill wherein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to they are falne thereby, and wherein nowe they see themselues likely to perish, they both are sorry whensoeuer they are falne thereinto, and seeke for help (so long as they haue any hope thereof) the best that they can. That they had good time thereunto, wee may well conceiue likewise, because the Flood did not rush in vpon them at once (and yet if it had, euen that also might well haue left them, or at least most of them, some leisure also, both to haue sought vnto God, and to haue made some shift for them selues) but grewe vpon them by little and little. For it came but by raine from aboue, and by an extraordinary flowing of the fountaines beneath: and these no faster nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but that forty daies therein were spent, before the water grew so high where the <hi>Arke</hi> was builded (which seemeth to bee no high place neither, because such are not lightly so conuenient for the vse of those that should bee imployed in such a woorke) that it was able to beare vp the <hi>Arke,</hi> that it might floate a loft thereupon. That yet notwithstanding now they found no helpe at al, neither by the <hi>Arke,</hi> nor any way else (notwithstanding all the mercies of God, when the time of vengeance was come) appeareth likewise, for that there were no moe in the <hi>Arke,</hi> but onely those eight persons before named, and for that the Text doth plainly declare, that al the rest perished, and that <hi>Noah</hi> onely and those that were with him, were preserued from that destruction. Those others whome this consideration toucheth more specially, are of two sorts: some, that were neere vnto <hi>Noah</hi> by some speciall coniunction; others that holpe him to builde the <hi>Arke</hi> that now wee speake of. Those that were neere vnto him by some speciall coniunction, were his kindred and owne family: which by likelihood were a speciall good company, because hee seemeth to haue been a Father of speciall account a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>g them; and yet wee reade of none of them all, that in this matter claue vnto him. That there were diuers likewise that <hi>Noah</hi> tooke vnto him to help him to build the <hi>Arke,</hi> it is most likely (and certaine it is, that it was done in the eie and sight of diuers, and to the priuity of many moe:) and yet wee reade of none of those neither, that tooke to themselues any benefit of it; and by the Text it is most certaine, that none of them did it. Those things that out of this story wee are to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, do some of them arise out of those things that are plainly set downe; and some out of those that are but only implied. Those that are plainely set downe, are these two: that in the end God brought in that heauy destruction that hee threatned before; and that in such time as before was noted. In that he brought in that heauy iudgment at length vpon them, wee may note two speciall lessons: one, how offensiue sinne is in the iudgements of God; the other, how certaine it is that whatsoeuer hee threatneth though it bee kept off for a time, yet notwithstanding (for the most part) in the end it commeth. How offensiue sinne is in the iudgements of God may sufficiently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:7530:34"/> in the greatnesse of the punishment, that for the same was inflicted vpon them, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> in that they were all (those fewe excepted, which also were not preserued for that they were better then the others, but of the speciall goodnesse of God, and to begin the world againe) so cleane destroied: not onely those that were so notorious sinners a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them; but euen those also that liued more orderly, and all their young children withall, that actually as yet had done no sinne. For seeing that so heauy a iudgement proceeded, from so good and gracious a God, needs must it bee some speciall great cause that vrged the same. How certaine it is, that whatsoeuer he threatneth, though it kept off for a time, yet notwithstanding in the end (for the most part) it commeth, may appeare in this likewise, that though this were so straunge a iudgement (to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy almost all, and that with so great, and so straunge a flood) and in the beginning almost of the world, before that the people were yet (to speake of) any way taught or called vpon to haue taken better waies: yet was it notwithstanding, as before it was threatned, when the time was come, brought in vpon them. For then may we much more strongly conclude, that such iudgements as are more vsuall with his iustice, and on our parts more iustly deserued (now that wee are so thoroughly war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, both by the Lawe and Prophets before, and by <hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>Apostels</hi> since) if at any time hee threatned them vnto vs, hee will likewise, if wee do not repent, in his due time bring them vpon vs. As touching the time, diuers there are that out of the proportion of it, doe gather a ghesse of the end of the world, accounting it to bee a thing not vnlikely, that such a quantity of time as was betwixt the first <hi>Adam</hi> and that generall flood, should bee likewise betwixt the last <hi>Adam Christ,</hi> and that generall destruction by fire which is to come: and so that the flood, which came in the yeare of the world one thousand sixe hundred fifty and sixe, from the first crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Adam,</hi> will goe neere to shew, about what time the end of the worlde shall bee, namely about the like time from <hi>Christ;</hi> one thousand and sixe hundred of them being spent already, and, by the reckoning of some, a good many moe. But of that there is no certainty: as those also themselues that note it, would haue none to make any other reckoning of it. But seeing that other tokens (of which <hi>Christ</hi> spake be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, willing vs, when wee should see those come to passe to lift vp our heads, and telling vs that then our saluation should bee neere) begin so fast to bee accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, so that wee presume not to set downe any certainty of it, wee may well stir vp our selues thereby the neerer that so wee may thinke it to be, the more to withdrawe our wonted loue from the things of this world, and to fasten it on those better things that do appertaine to the Kingdome of God. Those that were but only im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, did some of them concerne all: others, more specially but certaine of them. Those that concerned them all generally, were, that though many of them then did by likelihood hartely sorrow for their former sinnes, and sought for helpe: yet was <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> there no such mercy shewed to any one of them all. A speciall good pattern to shew vs likewise, that if wee slip the time of mercy, though then we sorrow neuer somuch, yet may it prooue a very fruitlesse sorrow vnto vs, and nothing at all helpe vs in the distresse that then wee are in. Those others whome it concerned more specially, were the residue of his kinsfolke and family, and those that holpe him to builde the <hi>Arke:</hi> of whome wee finde none of them all that tooke any benefit to their owne safety, of so good opportunity as thereby they had to haue auoided that imminent danger. Which may in like sort resolue vs in this, that the best men that are, can oft-times do no good at all in matters of this kinde (such as concerne the kingdome of God, or any way a true and liuely faith) with those that are neerest of all vnto them, or otherwise in duty bound vnto them: and that as those builders of the <hi>Arke</hi> builded for others, and not for themselues; euen so now also, and in all other ages besides, many there bee that doe well help others to the Kingdome of God, and yet themselues do still hold on the way that leadeth to eternall death.</p>
            <p n="6">6 Such a cleane riddance once being made of those former inhabitants of the world, that had so far defiled the earth with their sinne, and a perpetuall document being giuen thereby, howe feerefull indignation is in the iust iudgements of God,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:7530:34"/> due vnto the sinne of Man, now are wee to consider of those that remained, and of the race that comming of them succeeded the others that went before, vntill the time that out of them all hee chose one peculiar people vnto himselfe: where first wee are to consider of those that now remained; then of those that out of them were afterward raised. Concerning those that now remained, wee are first to consider of them so far as appertaineth vnto the story that wee haue in hand, concerning them all generally: then, as another other story requireth, which toucheth certaine of them more specially. So far as appertaineth vnto this story that wee haue in hand concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning them all generally, wee are first to consider of them as they were in safety while others perished: then, how afterward it pleased God to deale further with them As they were in safety while others perished, we are to note two speciall things: by what meanes they were in such safety; and in what manner they had the same. The meanes were none others, but onely such as whereby it pleased God to saue them, by gathering them-selues into the Vessell that to that end was prouided for them; and when they were there, by their continuing and abiding therein. And so we also neither are, nor can bee otherwise saued, but onely by such meanes, not as wee or others haue deuised, but onely by such as God hath in <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> prouided for vs: by gathering our selues vnto the helpe that is prouided; and by our fast abiding therein. In <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hat manner they had this safety will then sufficiently appeare, when <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> wee shall consider in some respects, both what manner of persons themselues were: and in what manner they were in the <hi>Arke</hi> during the time that the flood indured. What manner of persons themselues were, I extend onely to this, that no commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of godlinesse is there giuen to any of them, but onely to <hi>Noah:</hi> a right pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne therein also of our redemption in <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> for asmuch as hee onely hath all the godlinesse that is among vs; and wee haue none at all of our own, but are saued onely by his. In the manner wherein they were there, I note that they were but in homely case in some respect: and yet much better, then to haue perished with al the rest. In homely case they were in some respect, because they were shut vp as it were in prison, and by the closenesse of the vessell in the strong sauor of the beasts that were with them and of their ordure; and must needes imploy them-selues both in homely seruice, both in deliuering foorth such foode as they had to all those creatures, and in clensing their roomes from their filth as neede required: and this for the space of one whole yeere, and somewhat better. And wee also, though we haue a full and an absolute Redemption in <hi>Christ,</hi> yet if we be indeede in the fellowship of those that are saued, we haue heere in this world, but a loathsome estate to flesh and blood: but yet much better, then otherwise to perish with the wicked. In somuch that whosoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer hee be that hath a pleasant estate heere, and is not occupied in such imploymentes as are ircksome and greiuous to flesh and blood, and those also such as are for righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse sake, and in the way of his owne proper calling, though wee cannot say, that hee is none of the number of them that shall bee saued (because afterward he may be called to that estate, though yet hee be not) yet this is sure, that as yet hee is not in the way that leadeth thereunto, and so consequently cannot as yet (without presumption) make any sure reckoning of it: A needfull lesson for all our worldly and delicate pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> that will needs force to themselues a kinde of assurance that they are in the <hi>Arke</hi> with him, and do nothing at all intermeddle with those affaires that in no wise they can auoide if they bee there; neither yet are touched with those annoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances that are so far from being auoided to those that are there, that as <hi>Noah</hi> himselfe notwithstanding that hee was deere vnto God was not freede from them, so <hi>Christ</hi> his better, and deerer then hee, had experience of them in plentifull measure, and hauing giuen vs example therein, doth looke that wee also should follow. Howe it pleased God afterward to deale further with them, resteth in two principall pointes: one, as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> touching that their present estate then; the other, as touching another estate of theirs ensuing. As touching that present estate of theirs wherein they were then, wee haue two principall matters deliuered vnto vs: One, how it pleased him then to finish that <note place="margin">Gen. 8: 1-12.</note> hard estate of theirs; the other, how fully also hee did settle or content himselfe with that which already now hee had done. How it pleased him to finish that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> estate
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:7530:35"/> of theirs, is plainly set downe, in that now hauing asswaged the waters, and dried the ground, he called them forth of the Arke, and gaue them liberty, now to bee on the Earth againe. And so is it sure for vs also, that when God hath heere in like sort ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised those that are his, with such vexations and discontentments as his wisedome hath thought meetest for them, then will he behold them with his fauourable counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance againe, and refresh them much more, then euer hee did put them to griefe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. How fully he did settle or content himselfe with that which already now hee had done, doth likewise appeare in this that he did so graciously accept of the sacrifice that <hi>Noah,</hi> so soone as he was come forth of the Arke, did offer vnto him. Which that we may the better perceiue, we had need more distinctly to consider, both of that sacrifice of <hi>Noah:</hi> and of his acceptance of it. In that sacrifice of <hi>Noah</hi> we are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, both that he sacrificed then vnto God: and in what manner he performed the same. In that he sacrificed then vnto God, we are to learne, not to shrinke from the worship and seruice of God, for whatsoeuer aduersity he bringeth vpon vs: but to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour both his wisedome and goodnesse therein, and for the same to be thankfull vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him. The manner wherein he offered that sacrifice of his, is but in this, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding, now there were but a small store of Creatures left, to replenish the earth againe, yet euen of them also did he take of diuers kindes one, and offered the same in sacrifice to God. Out of which we also are to learne, that though our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ne store be neuer so scant, yet must we take heede that in Gods matters wee bee not too sparing, how scantsoeuer that our store may otherwise be. In Gods acceptance of it we may plainely see, that he lost not his labour, both for that the Text beareth witnesse that it was welcome vnto him: and especially, for that thereupon the Lord set downe with himselfe, that notwitstanding that man was very sinfull, and thereby would much pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke his heauy displeasure: yet would he neuer so destroy the World againe; but that all the seasons of the yeare should euer afterwards hold their wonted course. And so may we also affure our selues that if in such case we shall truly worship the Lord, both <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> it shall be so welcome vnto him, and he will so graciously reward the same, by with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding from vs so grieuous plagues for the time to come, that we also may account our labour therein, though it were neuer so much, yet to be very well bestowed. As touching that other estate of theirs ensuing, wee are to consider, what it was: and in <note place="margin">Gen. 9: 1-17.</note> whom they were made pertakers of it. That estate of theirs that now by the goodnes of God they had ensuing, did first respect their encrease or multiplication: then, their owne good estate besides. That which respected their encrease or multiplication, was that God gaue them liberty now to encrease and multiply: and himselfe also did blesse them thereunto. That which respected their owne good estate besides, was partly in certaine good thinges that God did giue them: and partly in putting them in good security of keeping one il thing away frō them, that now they did or might haue feared. Those good thinges that God did giue them, were some of them in respect of inferior Creatures: but one there was, which most respected some good order among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues. Those good things that GOD did giue them in respect of inferior Creatures, were two: one, the superiority ouer them; the other, a needfull vse of them. Superio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity ouer them he did giue them, in that he did put into the hearts of all those creatures the feare of Man: and gaue them all into his handes. The vse of them was for the most part, and so farre as any estate of theirs should require pennitted vnto them: but yet in one little point restrained. The vse of them was permitted vnto them so far as any estate of theirs should require, in that they were allowed so farre to take them to their needfull sustenance, as the fruites of the earth before. That little point which was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained vnto them, was but onely to forbeare the blood of them: so, not onely to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vre them to obedience, in forbearing somthing forbidden vnto them; but also to teach them to detest all manner of crueltie, and wanton riping into the blood or life of any. That which did most respect some good order among themselues, was, that Magistracy was at that time also by God ordained, in that he appointed that whosoeuer had shed any Mans bloud, euen by man also should his bloud bee shed. For seeing that euery where he forbiddeth priuate reuenge, and yet heere appointeth that such offenders by man should be punished, it doth necessarily follow, that publike Magistracy is thereby
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:7530:35"/> erected: and although but this onely vse thereof be there named; yet may we so much the sooner see, that other points of that duty bee necessarily imployed withall, as wee daily finde by experience, that Murtherers can neuer bee sufficiently auoyded, vnlesse other disorder besides bee also restrained. That one ill thing, that they did or might <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> haue feared, of which they were put in so good security that it should bee kept from them, was such a generall destruction of the World againe, by such a Floud, as nowe so lately they had seene before. Concerning which, and to put them in good security for that matter, both he maketh them a plaine promise, that he will neuer so destroy the World againe: and also giueth the Raine-bowe vnto them for an assurance or pledge thereof. In whom they were made partakers of these good thinges that God vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safed to bestow vpon them, is plaine enough in it selfe likewise, now that wee vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand that there is no attonement betwixt God and Man, nor any fauour of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes vs, but onely by Christ: and therefore, that as before was noted, in that so easy chasticement that was cast on man for their sinne, that it imported there was a recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation already made in the secret purpose of God; so in this likewise wee may see, that herein both <hi>Noah</hi> and all his company then, and the whole race of mankind since, did so much tast of the goodnesse of God in Iesus Christ, that euen all the Children of the World that enioy those fauours (as there are none that can bee without them) are all beholding to Christ for the same.</p>
            <p n="7">7 In that other Story that more specially concerneth but certaine of them, we haue <note place="margin">Gen. 9: 18-27.</note> deliuered vnto vs one speciall slip or ouersight that of infirmity was by one of these <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> committed, that was so lately deliuered from that fearefull destruction: and some other matters of speciall account thereupon likewise offered vnto vs. That one speciall slip or ouer-sight that was committed by one of those that were so lately deliuered, was committed by <hi>Noah</hi> himselfe: and the matter was, that planting a Vineyard, and drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Wine thereof, hee was so ouertaken therewith, that hee lay in his Tent vnco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered, to the shame and griefe of those that wished him well and were sorry to see it. Wherein wee are more specially to consider of the fault that therein hee made: and howe the same grew to bee knowne vnto others. In the fault that therein hee made, wee are to consider, that if such a Father in so fresh remembrance of so straunge and heauy a iudgement of God against sinne, could bee so ouertaken, then may wee, if we take not the better heede, much more easily fall into such, and greater also. In that it was then knowne vnto others (though it were but in his owne Tent onely that he lay so vncouered) and since likewise is made so knowne vnto all; wee may note likewise, that when there is any such sinne committed; then may the knowledge thereof easily get foorth to our owne discredit though it were done but in our owne howses, and those that are about vs bee otherwise neuer so neere vnto vs: and that if God would not spare the knowledge thereof vnto him, that so for the sauing of his credit it might haue beene smothered at home, then may wee much lesse looke for any other at the hands of God, but that if we also will not feare in secret to commit so shameful things, hee then doe spare vs as little in bringing them foorth vnto the open light of the Sun. Those other matters of speciall account that thereupon likewise are offered vnto vs, are <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> but such as haue some dependance on this other going before: but some of them haue it something neerer; and others somewhat farther off. Those that haue a neerer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance on this ouersight of <hi>Noah,</hi> are two: one of them, concerning <hi>Cham</hi> the yongest Sonne of <hi>Noah;</hi> the other concerning <hi>Sem,</hi> and <hi>Iaphet</hi> the elder. That which concerneth <hi>Cham,</hi> is, that finding his Father so vnseemly to ly, he did not himselfe co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer his nakednesse, but went foorth and tould his brethren of it: a naughty humor that yet also raigneth in many of vs (and of late hath masked much vnder the visour of a most zealous care of reformation) not our selues to couer such faults as wee finde (or suppose wee finde) in many of our Fathers, but to disclose the same unto others; and not onely to disclose them, but also to lay them out to the vttermost, and the moee we can disgrace them thereby, the greater pleasure to take therein. That which concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth <hi>Sem</hi> &amp; <hi>Iaphet,</hi> is, that they hearing thereof, tooke it so ill, that they were not only sorry themselues, but being carefull also to couer the same, tooke a garment on their
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:7530:36"/> shoulders, and turning their faces away from the fight thereof, went backward, and laid the garment thereon: A good example for others to follow, when-soeuer they doe in like sort finde any of their Fathers to bee so ouerseene, and some of their brethren to make but a game or pastime at it, or at least so to trauell therewith, that they cannot rest vntill they haue vttered it vnto others. Those that haue their dependance thereon somewhat farther off, doe concerne that which ensued thereon: namely, that <hi>Noah</hi> knew both the one and the other; and then pronounced accordingly of them. In that he knew (when he awaked) both the one and the other, that is, who had dealt so ill with him, and on the other side who had dealt well, it is good for vs also to note, that it is wisedome to auoide the one, and to vse the other; so much the rather, as heereby wee may gather, that GOD will suffer neither of both still to lie hid, but one time or other will bring them both into open light, that so eyther of them may then receiue whatsoeuer is meetest for them. In that which hee pronounced accordingly of them, we are to consider thereof, first as it was vttered by him: then as afterward it prooued indeede. As it was vttered by him, wee see he pronounced a curse to the one: and a blessing vnto the others. In the cursse that he pronounced to the one, wee are to see, what it was, and vnto whom it was chiefely directed. What this cursse was, is first set downe generallie: then more specially. Generally it is said, that he is accursed: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in wee may see, that some curse or other is due to those that shall in such sort offend. More specially it is set down to be, that he shal be a base Seruant vnto his Brethren: an estate that is due to those that do so little reuerence those whom they should; and yet, being so easie as it is (being in such abiection but vnto his Bretheren) such as boadeth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> a great deale worse else-where, if they doe not repent. That it was not directed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to himselfe that made the offence, but vnto one of his Sonnes (euen to the fourth, which seemeth also to bee the youngest) as namely to <hi>Canaan,</hi> it is an example, both that a Man may offend and procure wrath to come from the presence of God for his fault, and yet hee himselfe not bee touched therewith that made the fault: and that if our selues offend, wee may easily ouerthrow our Children thereby. In the blessing, wee are in like sort to consider, who they were that had the blessing: and what was the blessing on them bestowed. In searching out who they were that had the blessing, as appeareth euen at the first, that they were his other two Sonnes, <hi>Sem</hi> and <hi>Iaphet,</hi> that had so couered that nakednesse of his; and not put off vnto their Children, but bestowed euen on themselues: so may we in like sort gather, that in doing the like, we may account to meete with some blessing, one or other, such as the wisedome of God shall thinke meetest for vs; and that our selues in our owne daies, may see some effect thereof to the comfort of our selues and others. The blessing that was bestowed vpon them, was part of it, proper to either: and part of it, common to both. That which was proper to either, was, first as touching <hi>Sem</hi> his second Son, that the Lord his God, or the God that should bee worshipped in his line or family, was the blessed or true God: then, as touching <hi>Iaphet</hi> his eldest Sonne, that God would in time bring to passe (or at least, that himselfe, as the iudgement of some is, doth wish the same) that <hi>Iaphet</hi> also should dwell in the Tents of <hi>Sem,</hi> or came to so true a profession and knowledge of the selfe-same true and liuing God, and thereby of such better thinges in the World to come, that they also should account themselues but Pilgrims heere, as much as any of the faithfull besides, and so should dwell (both in that profession, and hope) in the Tents of <hi>Sem.</hi> That which was common to them both, was, that <hi>Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> should be Seruant to eyther of them, both to the one &amp; to the other: so that eyther of them should haue both the vse of his seruice; and the honor to be his Lord. As af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward it prooued in deede, we are to consider, first of the curse that heere is vttered: and then of the blessing that was giuen withall. As touching the curse that heere is vttered, we are in like sort to consider, that being pronounced, not of his owne priuate affection, but by direction of the good Spirit of God prophetically, we must needs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, that the same was accordingly fulfilled, whether we haue the performance of it afterward set downe in the Story or not: as also wee haue in the Scriptures following <note place="margin">Iud. 1. 16. 4. 11 1. Sam. 15. 6. 1. Chro. 2, 55.</note> diuers other such places besides. For we haue diuers places that shew, that the <hi>Kenites</hi> which were of <hi>Iethro</hi> the Father in Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> did afterward dwell with the people
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:7530:36"/> of God: but no Story at all of their first comming vnto them; but rather a plaine deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all to ioyne with them therein, when <hi>Moses</hi> did specially desire the same. So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise <note place="margin">Num. 10. 30.</note> there is in the time of <hi>Dauid,</hi> and towardes the end of his raigne, a plaine relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a slaughter that <hi>Saule</hi> in his time had made on certaine of the <hi>G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

And so may it be in this likewise: that wee may not looke to finde the full accomplishment of this curse that was cast on <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 span">

               </hi> in any History that is left vs thereof; and yet to be sure, that it was accomplished euen to the full. Which it behooueth vs heere to marke somuch the rather, for that otherwise <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> that which is by the learned giuen in for the accomplishment of this curse, the more it is considered of, the shorter may wee finde that it commeth of that which the curse may seeme to import. Whereunto though it bee no hard matter to adde somewhat more: yet it may be, that vnto those that shall enter into any set consideration of it, euen all will seeme to be little enough. Neuerthelesse it shall be good to consider of it, and to see how farre it reacheth: and first of that which is by the learned noted to be the accomplishment of it; then what it is that may further be conceiued thereof. In that which is by the learned noted to be the accomplishment of it, we are to consider, not onely what it is: but also in what respect it may seeme to be short of that which the curse dooth seeme to import. What it is may soone be seene, for that it is no more, but that subiection, that the <hi>Cana<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ites</hi> were brought vnto, vnder the <hi>Israelites:</hi> when first they had destroyed so many of them; and afterward made many of the rest tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries vnto them, and some fewe of them (as namely the <hi>Gibe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ites)</hi> their Seruants in deede. Though this be the thing that most of the learned account to be the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment of that curse aforesaid, yet may it seeme to bee short, both in it selfe: and in comparison of others also. In it selfe may seeme to come short, first in respect of the parties vnder whom <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> was deuoted to be: then, in respect of the Nature of the subiection that there is described. The parties vnder whom he was deuoted to be in such subiection, were first his owne Bretheren: then also, to both his Vnkles besides, who were <hi>Sem</hi> and <hi>Iaphet.</hi> But in this subiection that yet wee haue found, besides that it was but of his posterity, euen they also therein were subiect to none, but onely to certaine of the race of <hi>Sem:</hi> and then doe we want in this, both that which should be to his owne Bretheren; and that which should bee to <hi>Iaphet</hi> also. The Nature of that subiection that he should be in, is by <hi>Noah</hi> in such tearmes set downe, as that wee may well looke for villanage or seruitude of the lowest degree, and such as wee finde not in that same that now we speake of: and first if not in the <hi>Gabeanites</hi> which were in most seruitude of any of them (because that both they were but a small portion of them, and in no such seruitude neither;) then much lesse in those that were but tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries vnto them, holding as they did so many good Citties, Townes, and Castles, for that small tributarie subiection of theirs. The comparison that I speake of, is of those <hi>Israelites</hi> themselues, first in <hi>Aegypt:</hi> and then in the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> also. In <hi>Aegypt</hi> they were in great bondage vnto that part of the race of <hi>Cham:</hi> and that same much greater, then euer was this race of <hi>Cham</hi> therein vnto them. In the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> also both the <hi>Canaanites</hi> generally, and the <hi>Aramites</hi> and <hi>Philistims</hi> more specially, (whereof the former were in part descended from <hi>Canaan</hi> himselfe, and the latter from <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> one of the other Sonnes of <hi>Cham,</hi> and so were their neere Kinsmen, and had a good peece of their Land) had them in so long and hard subiection, that the Children of <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raell</hi> could not much more be said to haue had the <hi>Canaanites</hi> vnder their subiection, then the <hi>Canaanites</hi> and other neere Kinsmen of theirs, had the <hi>Israelites</hi> in subiection to them. That which may be further conceiued, is partly of the persons themselues: and partly of the Land which they had to inhabit. The persons themselues were, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Canaan,</hi> the common Auncestor of them all: or those that were of him descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. As touching <hi>Canaan</hi> himselfe, because the curse is directed so specially to him, therefore it cannot bee denied or thought to be against the sence of it, if himselfe were of so abiect a Nature, as the same were fulfilled onely in him: but of that we haue no Storie at all; and so we are not to perswade our selues, that it was accomplished in him, vnlesse we had some warrant for it. But because it was in such sort spoken, therefore we may assure our selues, that if it were not fulfilled any way else, then was it vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:7530:37"/> fulfilled in him, though wee haue no speciall Story of it. Concerning those that were of him discended (in whom by most likelihood wee are to looke for the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment of it, because we haue not the accomplishment of the blessing neither, so farre as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap> haue any Story of it, in <hi>Sem</hi> and <hi>Iaphet</hi> themselues, but onely in those that descended of them) seeing the other sense that before we spake of, commeth so short, that it were good to consider of some other, if the Text doe affoord the same, thus much wee know by all experience, and by the allowance of the Law of God it selfe, that such as had any Bond-men or Villaines, had likewise power to vse them almost as they would. Insomuch, that if they should beate any such to death, although then they were to be punished if they dyed vnder their hands: yet if they liued but a day or two after, then was there nothing to be laid to their charge for the same. By which, if wee measure the subiection or seruitude that the <hi>Canaanites</hi> were by this curse deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto, then the Story is cleere therein, that they were so fully giuen into the handes of the Children of <hi>Israell,</hi> that not onely they might vtterly destroy them, Man, Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and Child, not sparing any; but also they were very earnestly and often aduised so to doe, and to leaue at all no memory of them: then the which, there was neuer granted greater power vnto any, of whatsoeuer Bond-men he had; though the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest and the most abiect that euer was, or that could bee conceiued by any. But then this also was (as the other before) but onely to that small portion of the race of <hi>Sem:</hi> and not to his Bretheren, nor yet to his Vnckle <hi>Iaphet,</hi> as the curse that on him was <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> laid doth plainely require. The Land that they had to inhabite, was of them (the most ancient Inhabitants thereof that are knowne) called also the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in if we may be allowed to looke for the accomplishment of this curse aforesaide, or but so farre as we shall find the other to giue vs iust occasion to seeke further, then may we find, both that it hath beene vnder such seruitude, as may more fully aunswere the curse that now we speake of, in euery point: and that whereas one doubt there is that may be conceiued, both it may be sufficiently answered, and withall declared, that in some respect it were not amisse, so farre to make the Land it selfe liable vnto it. That it hath beene vnder such seruitude as may more fully answere this curse in euery point, I take it to be apparant in the Story of it: both because it hath beene very much in bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage vnto forraine powers; and because it was in bondage to those that here are spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of. Both which are so plaine in themselues, especially in those foure chiefe and principall Monarchies, and in the bipartite estate of the third, that it is not needfull but onely thus briefly to point vnto it. That one doubt that may be conceiued, is, that then, when it was in subiection, it was not inhabited by the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> to whom this curse appertained, but by the <hi>Israelites</hi> that were the blessed: and it cannot be denied, but that so it was indeede. But then it is to be considered withall, that now we make our inquiry but onely for the Land it selfe, how farre it may yeeelde vs a good accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment of the curse aforesaide: and that they being the peculiar people of God, and therefore ordained to speciall holinesse, and carrying about with them such corruption of Nature as needed to be by such meanes amended, it was to good purpose, that such a speciall and perpetuall seruitude should be so allotted vnto the Land that they should inhabit, that so whosoeuer it were that raigned, yet they should euer be in subiection, and thereby euer so tast of correction, that afterward they might the more plentifullie reape the fruites of the same, vnto their owne vnspeakable comfort. The blessing that was giuen withall, is a great deale more easie, both for that the latter part of it (that I meane which is common to them; namely, that eyther of them should haue the vse &amp; honor of <hi>Canaans</hi> seruice) is so neere coupled to the curse of <hi>Canaan</hi> already declared, that whatsoeuer light it hath obtained, this also is made partaker of it; and because the former of them (that which is proper to eyther of them) is made plaine enough by the Story ensuing: both as touching the blessednesse of the God of <hi>Sem;</hi> and that <hi>Iaphet</hi> in time to come should be allured to his Tentes also. For as touching the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, that whereas, euen as people encreased, so would they degenerate, and set vp many false Goddes among them, insomuch that the true God which made them and fed them, should neuerthelesse on all handes be much forgotten and neglected among <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> them; yet in some of the race of <hi>Sem</hi> should be worshipped, and many waies declare
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:7530:37"/> himselfe to be their God: the Story that followeth doth plainly declare, that the Lord, that most true and liuing God, and euer blessed, did afterward betake himselfe to one speciall people, and chose them to bee his owne peculiar, among whom also hee was knowne and worshipped; and that the people that so he chose, did descend of neither of the other, but onely of <hi>Sem, Abram</hi> beeing in lineall descent the ninth from him. Whereby there was, (as it were) a Standard aduanced to all, and a plaine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of these two pointes, both that the true and liuing God would bee knowne in the World, and among the Sonnes of Men; and in which of those three progenies they had to seeke him: a great helpe to those that would gladly seeke vnto him; and sufficient to make all those inexcusable that did not regard him. For although the Progeny of <hi>Sem</hi> was very large, and it be not declared out of which of all those Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies God would chuse that peculiar people of his: yet when he did chuse them, then he dealt in such sort for them, that it might indifferent plainely appeare, euen at the first while they were but few, and afterward most cleerely when they were moe, that there was indeede such a God among them. So likewise as touching the latter, of that bringing of the race of <hi>Iaphet</hi> to dwell in the Tentes of <hi>Sem,</hi> wee see that <hi>Europe,</hi> which way <hi>Iaphet</hi> did most of all spread, was brought long since to the knowledge of that true and blessed God; and haue so made their dwelling therein, that whereas the most of the others (that once also were brought to the selfe-same knowledge) haue since gone backe, yet doe these (for the most part of them) still remaine vnder the same. And whereas the Nature of the Word importeth, that they should bee sweetely allured thereunto, as Parents vse to flatter their Children, and to bring them on by speaking them faire: so we may see, that not by force of Armes, but onely by the power of the sweete and comfortable word of God, were they brought vnto the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of the faith at the first, and thereby are still preserued in it.</p>
            <p n="8">8 Concerning those that descended of these, first they are somewhat sorted vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> vs: then, haue wee one speciall Story of them. And we finde that they are some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what sorted vnto vs, first in that they all haue their genealogies so plainly described, <note place="margin">Gen. 10: 1-32.</note> that wee may easily see from whome they descend: then also, in that diuers of them are sorted vnto the land of their habitation likewise. In that they haue their genea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logies so plainely described wee are to note two things: first, that it pleased God to shew himselfe to haue a care to performe the promise that in those matters hee made vnto them; then, that we also are not to neglect (much lesse to abandon) the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of them. The promise that in those matters hee made vnto them, was princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally of the promised Seede: but partly also of the prerogatiue that lately wee sawe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> was giuen to certaine of the line of <hi>Sem</hi> ouer the <hi>Canaanites.</hi> In respect of that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised Seede, besides that the whole race of <hi>Sem</hi> is set downe as the others are in the tenth Chapter generally, in the eleuenth one line of it (that whereof the promised Seede should come) is set downe more specially euen to the time of <hi>Abraham</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, <note place="margin">Gen. 11, 10-26</note> the ninth from <hi>Sem:</hi> and so carefull a reckoning of the time ioyned withall, that therein we may see (being laide to that which goeth before) that vnto the cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of <hi>Abraham</hi> which imediately followeth, there were nowe spent of the world aboue 2000. yeares. In respect of that prerogatiue of certaine of the race of <hi>Sem</hi> ouer the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> the line of <hi>Canaan</hi> is likewise more fully recited. That if wee should neglect the knowledge thereof, we did therein offend, there is no question, sauing onely that else-where wee are forbidden to striue about such matters. But that is meant of those that are vncertaine or needelesse: not tending to trueth and godlinesse, but breeding hurtfull and needelesse contention. Whereas these (on the other side) are such, as are most certaine, and many waies so needefull be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, that the neglecting thereof hath not gon so far vnpunished with the greatest learned before nor since, but that thereby they haue bewraied their ignorance in great matters besides. In the sorting of them into the land of their habitation wee are to note, that for a couple of them, it was done but generally: but for certaine of the third of them, much more specially. Those two for whome it is done but gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally are <hi>Iaphet</hi> and <hi>Sem,</hi> the posterity of the former of them being allotted vnto
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:7530:38"/> those Countries or Regions which they were wont to call the Iles or Regions of the Gentiles, which then did ly North-west from them, and since is properly (for the most part of them) called <hi>Europe;</hi> and of the latter, from those partes East-ward. but yet so breifly, as but a small part of their habitation is there named. Those that of the third progeny of them (which are those that descended of <hi>Cham,</hi> his yon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest Sonne) had their habitation more specially set downe, were two: one of the Sonnes of <hi>Cush</hi> his eldest Sonne, which was <hi>Nimrod;</hi> and the race of his yongest gest of all, which was <hi>Canaan. Nimrod</hi> seemeth to bee the yongest Sonne of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther also; but yet the first that grew so mighty and the mightiest of all of his time: so hath hee his habitation more specially set downe, euen in the heart of the Country where then they were. <hi>Canaan</hi> his yongest Sonne had many Children, and hath the bounds of his habitation distinctly set downe: and in such sort, as that the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> might then see, what was the Land that they might looke for. That spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall Story that wee haue of them, was, that before they diuided themselues, they would needes haue made both a proud and presumptious worke, had not God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated their endeuours so as hee did. So are we therein to consider, both of that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour of theirs: and how it pleased God to defeat them therein. Their endeuour <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> was, to make them-selues a Citty and Tower of speciall height, both to get them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues a name; and to bee such a strength vnto them, as that they should not neede to bee scattered abroade on the face of the earth: so endeuoring (in the pride of their hearts) to aduance themselues, and to shrowde themselues vnder the protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their owne strength; and withall giuing vnto vs a right pattern, what is that inward and secret meaning, out of which all the sumptuous buildings of the world are wont to proceede. In Gods defeating of that endeuour of theirs we are to note, both what hee did concerning the same: and what a token or marke thereof was left vnto others in that their building. That which hee did, resteth in two principall points: one, how hee addressed himselfe vnto it; the other how hee did the thing it selfe. Hee addressed himselfe vnto it, in that hee tooke knowledge of their doings (to which end it is said, that hee came downe to see what they were doing) and then resolued what himselfe would doe therein. The thing it selfe that then hee did, to hinder that presumptious deede of theirs, was, that whereas all were of one Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage till then, hee foorth-with so diuided their tongues that both they were faine to leaue off their building, for that now but few of them vnderstood one another, and to sort themselues together to such seuerall companies, as wherein to they saw there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by that the Lord had sorted them now. And so by the reason hereof both they left off building, and dispersed themselues in seuerall companies, to inhabit and to reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish the rest of the earth as it pleased God in time to encrease them, and therewithal to spread them further abroade. The token or marke that hereof was left vnto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in that their building, was the name that now was giuen it, being <hi>Babel</hi> or <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilon,</hi> which doth signifie <hi>Confusion:</hi> giuing all men to vnderstand, that the iust de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert of such proude attempts wheresoeuer, and that which properly belongeth vnto them, is, in the end, to come to confusion; to the shame of those that did attempt them, and to make others the more wary thereby, that somuch the rather they euer tooke heede of such presumption. And therefore is it somuch the stranger (but yet therein a better patterne, of how incorrigible a nature wee are) that after-ward notwithstanding the building of that Citty and Tower was so prosecuted by others, that for magnificency or strangenesse of the woorke, it afterward became an asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment or wonder vnto the world. But of that more (if neede shall bee) when wee come to the time whereunto it belongeth. And thus much as touching the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Story of the whole world, for the space of two thousand yeeres and moe, so long as God had not chosen (as yet) any one peculiar people vnto himselfe; but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly had certaine seuerall persons (nowe and then one, without any number that yet wee reade of) whome it pleased him more specially to touch with his good Spirit, and whome it pleased him to make to shine as lights vnto others, in the midst of a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> rude and godlesse people.</p>

               </gap>, and howe to bee in all respects perswaded of it, and first who they are that belong thereunto: then of what face they are amongst men, or what is their appearance vnto the world. In searching out who they are that belong thereunto, wee are to take heede, that wee rest not onely in the truer mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers: but that wee admit into this company all others also that are outward profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors, though otherwise we be not able to finde any true sincerity in them. Of those that were the truer members of the Church, wee haue in all this time but fewe, for whome wee haue any good warrant to giue that honour vnto them: but diuers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of whome wee may bee so perswaded. Those that are of the former sort, are none that wee knowe of by name in all this time, but onely <hi>Abell, Henoc</hi> and <hi>Noah:</hi> but of the others (such as of whome we may bee so perswaded) <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eue, Seth, Enos, Sem, Iaphet,</hi> and <hi>Heber;</hi> and, it may bee, some others of the Fathers besides. Of those that were outward professors, first it is to bee noted, that in this compasse of time we finde no one People, Citty, or Family: then also, that besides those that are before mentioned for the truer members, wee finde but fewe of whome we may bee herein assured. But <hi>Kaine</hi> certainly was one of the outward professors: and we may hope that so were all those other Fathers before recited. And if that place in the end of the fourth of <hi>Genesis</hi> bee to bee vnderstood in the better sense, then wee may account of diuers others that then began to gather them-selues vnto the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward profession of true Religion. If it bee taken in the worse part: yet both it selfe implieth, that there were some before; and that afterward some are named to be the Children of God, it seemeth so to import likewise. In searching out of what face they were among men, or what was their appearance vnto the world, wee are first to consider of the chiefe and principall matter: and then of certaine others that may not well bee omitted neither. Of what face or appearance they were in the cheife and principall matter, is to bee found in the Religion that they professed. Which that wee may the better finde (and to such confusion of some, and strengthning of others, as this Age of ours doth most require) it shall bee good first to consider, what it was not: then, what it was. To finde out what it was not, wee are to note, that as yet none of those points of the Romish religion (wherein they haue sundred themselues from other Churches) was professed by any: as namely, not the Masse, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> nor praying for the dead, or to others then God himselfe, nor worshipping of Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, nor any other of that kinde. What it was, is declared but breifly neither: but one point there is, that is plainely set downe; and another that certainely seemeth to bee implied. That which is plainely set downe, is, that they sacrificed vnto the true and liuing God: as <hi>Abell, Kaine,</hi> and <hi>Noah.</hi> That which certainely seemeth to bee implied, is, that they rested or fastned their faith on the promised Seede. For though wee haue it not (in all this compasse) reported of any of them: yet both elsewhere it is so reported of all the godly Fathers generally; and it is an insepera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble propriety of all the Faithfull, gladly and readily to take houlde on what-soeuer Couenant of grace it pleaseth God to offer vnto them. Whereas therefore it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed God before to offer that Couenant vnto them, it doth necessarily follow, that so many as sought after God, did readily also rely thereon, so soone as they got any knowledge of it: and very likely, that the knowledge thereof was carefully preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued among the better sort of them, and deliuered from one to another. Those o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther matters that were not altogether of so great moment as this, and yet such as might not well bee omitted neither, are two: one, of what reckoning they were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong others; the other, what gouernment they had among themselues. Of what reckoning they were among others, doth chiefly appeare in <hi>Abell,</hi> and <hi>Noah:</hi> and partly also in <hi>Sem,</hi> and <hi>Heber.</hi> For <hi>Abell</hi> was slaine by his brother <hi>Kaine:</hi> and <hi>Noah</hi> despised almost of all. <hi>Sem</hi> also and <hi>Heber,</hi> if they were of the godlier sort as (for
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:7530:39"/> the one of them at least) it is most likely, and whatsoeuer godly people were at that time in those parts besides, notwithstanding, all that godlinesse of theirs: yet, as it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, that they were all troden downe (to speake of) by that speciall vsurpation of <hi>Nimrod,</hi> and made to be of no reckoning, in comparison of that gallant crew of theirs. What gouernment likewise they had among themselues, is so much the rather to bee marked of vs, as that it is certaine that now there was no <hi>Pope</hi> among them, nor one generall Head ouer all the rest; neither yet any part of that newe Plat-forme, that of late was so peremptorily vrged vnto vs: and yet notwithstanding, that God had his people among them; and so may haue with vs likewise (if there bee nothing wanting besides) though in our gouernment we haue neither of those. The better sort of them (by all likelyhood) would bee in obeysance vnto those Fathers that were the Heades ouer those Families in which they were: and, when others tooke vpon them more then it be came them to doe, yet if afterward it pleased God to establish that Soueraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of theirs, then (no doubt) would the better sort bee in obedience to them likewise, in all things lawfull.</p>

            <p n="1">1 <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S touching the more speciall Story of the peculiar people of God, to the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> end, that we be the lesse deceiued therein, it is to bee knowne, that some few there are, who may seeme to appertaine to that company; but doe not: and yet are not altogether to bee left out neither, but in place con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient to be remembred. So are wee not in such sort to deale in this Story, as that eyther we mingle both these together, or so follow on those which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly belong hereunto, that wee altogether leaue out the others (as otherwise it were a slip, that on either side were easily made:) but first considering of those that properly belong to this Story; then are we, in like sort to consider somthing of the others also. Againe, those that now we speake of, and account to be no part of this Story, are such notwithstanding, and the consideration of them such likewise, that they may not so conueniently tarry till we haue altogether finished the other; and much lesse take place before them: and therefore are we, at such time as it may seeme meetest to remember them, to make digression from the other to take in these; and so to returne to the other againe. The time likewise when it is meetest to remember these, will bee, as I take it, when those that were to be his peculiar people, were vouchsafed that praerogatiue so farre, that both themselues were growne to bee, for the number of them, a competent people, and that the Lawes of God were giuen them. For number they were a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent people, when it pleased God, by the Ministery of <hi>Moses,</hi> to deliuer them out of <hi>Aegypt:</hi> but the giuing of his Lawes vnto them (which was much by the Ministerie of <hi>Moses</hi> also) extended it selfe (in a manner) to all the time of <hi>Moses</hi> gouernment, and while the people were in the Wildernesse; many of those Lawes being deliuered vnto them, in the first Booke of <hi>Moses</hi> called <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> and towardes the ende of <hi>Moses</hi> life, and of their Pilgrimage there, it also being (a little before his death) his Farewell vnto them. So are we first to see the Story of Gods peculiar people, so long as the gouernment of <hi>Moses</hi> lasted: and then, for a time, to digresse to those others; and so to returne to these againe. The better to see the Story of Gods peculiar peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, it shall be good, first to consider somewhat of the whole: then to deale more spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in it. That which wee are to consider as touching the whole, doth partly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect the substance of it: and partly certaine accidents thereunto appertaining. That which concerneth the substance of it, is no more but this, that now it pleased God to take vnto him one peculiar people out of all the Nations, Kingdomes, or peoples of al the earth, and to keepe himselfe onely to those for a certaine time. So that, as before he estranged himselfe vnto all mankind generally, taking vnto him no one people in all the World, but onely certaine seuerall persons: so now also hee taketh but one, and
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:7530:39"/> estrangeth himselfe to all the rest. And it seemeth that so hee did, the better to crosse that common corruption that is among vs, that we thinke our selues reasonable good, and not altogether vnmeete for the presence of GOD. For this cause it seemeth (to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> teach vs how exceeding foule we are, and how vnmeete to haue any thing to do with his Holinesse) both that he did so estrange himselfe then vnto all generally, and now when hee tooke one people vnto him, yet kept so aloofe from them also (as afterward we are more fully to see) that thereby he did meane to gather them vnto a better consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of themselues, and in this his estranging of himselfe from them, to finde out their owne vncleannesse. The accidents that doe belong hereunto, are especially two: one of the time: another of the Bookes, wherein we are to looke for this Story. That of the time is no more but this, that after that God betooke himselfe vnto these, and chose them to be his peculiar people, he also kept to them notwithstanding their great prouocations to the contrary, for the space of about two thousand yeares: and then cast off them for their great iniquity, and enlarged his Kingdome vnto all Nations ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally. The Bookes wherein we are to looke for their Story, are all the residue of the Byble, both of the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New Testament,</hi> to speake of: so that all the whole Byble goeth (in a manner) onely of them.</p>
            <p n="2">2 More specially we are to consider, first how it pleased God to raise this people <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> vnto him: then, in what estate they afterward stood. To finde out, howe it pleased God to raise that people vnto him, because it was not done at once, but was a worke of some continuance, or asked some time in the course that God thought good to take, we are therefore more distinctly to marke, both how hee began at the first: and how he proceeded vntill he had brought them to bee so many, that nowe they were (euen for multitude also) a reasonable people. To finde out how he began at the first, we must haue recourse to the calling of <hi>Abraham,</hi> because that in him they also had their first call vnto the Dignity that now we speak of. A Story that is but briefely set down; but yet so much the rather to be considered of vs, for that it is a matter of speciall im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance: and first, as it did proceede from God; then, as it was obeyed by them. As it did proceede from God, we are to consider, first of the Persons: then, of the thing it selfe. The Persons are, first, of him that calleth: then, of those that are called. Hee that calleth, is onely God, and can be none other: for that, as he that maketh a feast, is to make the choice of his Guests as himselfe thinketh good; so God much rather is in such cases to take to himselfe whom it pleaseth him. And although this calling of his be no more but an outward testification to them, of that which was determined long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the secret purpose of God: yet both they were to account this to bee the very first beginning of their good estate towardes God (and so consequently, that it was of his calling on them, and not of their seeking to him;) and we likewise are so to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solue our selues herein, that whatsoeuer good estate wee account our selues to haue in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Christ, the same must be by his goodnesse preuenting vs, and not that we doe any way first seeke vnto him. Those that are called, are principally <hi>Abraham</hi> himselfe: and then diuers others besides. <hi>Abraham</hi> was of the Line of <hi>Sem,</hi> and the tenth from him, reckoning <hi>Sem</hi> himselfe for one: and so of the line of <hi>Heber</hi> also, and the seauenth from him, reckoning <hi>Heber</hi> himselfe likewise for one; of whom the cheefest of the people that came of <hi>Abraham,</hi> were afterward tearmed <hi>Haebrewes</hi> also. Which <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> dwelt among the <hi>Chaldaans,</hi> and (as it seemeth, for it is otherwise expounded by some) in a Citty or Countrey there called <hi>Vr;</hi> a Man of lxxv. yeares olde, when by the vertue of Gods Commaundement he was to leaue his owne Countrey, and to soiourne in a strange Country, himselfe not knowing where as yet: and both his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, Kindred, and Fathers house being infected with Idolatry, not vnlike but that him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe was at that same time such likewise, and so doe diuers places of Scripture seeme <note place="margin">

Those others besides were of two sorts, some of them of that present time: others, that did afterward follow. Those that were of that present time were on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:7530:40"/> such, as one way or other did belong vnto <hi>Abram:</hi> as <hi>Terah,</hi> his Father, in good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will; and all his owne retinue, in duty. For as touching <hi>Lot,</hi> though he also belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>Abram,</hi> yet as his neere Kinsman, beeing his Brother <hi>Harans</hi> Sonne, yet whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he went as of himselfe of good-will with his Vnckle, or whether <hi>Abram</hi> tooke him with him as one of his charge (being as yet vnder-age to gouerne himselfe) that is not so farre as yet I haue found declared by the Text it selfe. And as for all these, though they were no part of that people with whom God made that couenant that followeth (at least, but onely for their owne persons, and but so farre as they claue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Abram,</hi> and not for their Children:) yet may we account, that these also had some calling of God, though not immediatly from God vnto them, yet in that <hi>Abram</hi> was so called, and these did in such sort belong vnto him at the time of his calling, as that thereupon they might not well leaue him, and besides had (euen thereby onely) an open way made them, by right to enter into the fruition of some good part of those mercies that were bestowed on <hi>Abram.</hi> A good example for vs, that euen to conuerse with those that are in the fauour of God, or any way to haue our being with them, doth make vs oft-times to bee partakers of great blessinges with them (as with <hi>Noah</hi> in the Arke before:) and that men may be of the people of God that are not of <hi>Abram</hi> by lineall descent, nor a Church that can plead continuall succession of their Byshops from the Apostles. Those that did afterward follow, were principally <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> those that were descended of him by <hi>Isaac</hi> and <hi>Iacob:</hi> then in a second degree, so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny besides, as of other Nations or Families, should at any time in Religion ioyne them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues with them. In the thing it selfe wee are to consider, what is required of him: and what reasons are vsed to mooue him thereunto. The thing that is required, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth on two principall charges: one, concerning that which he must forsake or leaue; the other, concerning that which now he was to addresse himselfe vnto. That which he was to forsake and leaue, was all his whole Countrey generally: then more special<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, both his owne Kindred, and Fathers house. That which now hee should addresse himselfe vnto, was to another Countrey, but (not at large) whether himselfe would, nor as yet named vnto him: but onely, which God himselfe should shewe him. An example that giueth maruailous good instruction to vs: but yet such, as is not so cleere neither, but that something may seeme to be somewhat strong against it. The instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction that it giueth to vs, is, that we in like case should leaue the waies and fashions of our Countrey, Kindred, and Fathers house, both in matters of Religion, and in life and conuersation, so farre-foorth as they doe not agree with the word of God: and goe with God, in such sort as his word doth teach vs, vnto such waies as it shall please him, by that word of his to appoint vs vnto. That which may seeme to be strong against it, is no more but this, that whereas hee led them to another people, as bad as those from whom he brought them, how it may be grounded on this, that wee also should leaue so dangerous company, when as these are not forsaken heere, but changed ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The aunswere whereunto may be, that although the Inhabitantes of the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> were as bad as the others, and worse too; yet could they not be so dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to <hi>Abram,</hi> as the others might bee, for that our owne Countrey fashions are stronger against vs then are the waies of any strangers whatsoeuer: and then the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction that before wee spake of, may easily appeare to haue ground-worke enough on this. Out of which we may also gather, that whereas marriage with these was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards forbidden, so specially to the people of God, when as notwithstanding they might marry with others as bad as they: euen we also, when wee would marry, haue greater cause to beware of the adhaerents of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> then wee neede to haue of diuers others that we might haue among vs as bad as they, because we are by former education in more danger of them, then in like proportion we could bee of others. The reasons that he vsed to mooue him thereunto, are all of one kind, taken of the vtility that dependeth thereon, and in that case should redound vnto him: both generally concerning his whole line; and more specially as touching one principall branch rhereof. As touching his whole line generally, the benefit consisteth in two <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> principall pointes: one, that they should be many; the other, that they should bee a blessed people. As touching that one principall braunch, it was, that among those
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:7530:40"/> that should come of him by lincall descent, some one there should be, in whom all the Kindreds of the earth should be blessed: which is performed in Iesus Christ. Which blessings are, being rightly considered, so very great, and in so gracious manner pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised withall, that it appeareth plainely thereby, that for that small seruice, God did vouchsafe him a very great and rich reward. As this calling of theirs was obeyed by them, we are to consider, who they were that obeyed the same: and how hard a thing it was, that thereby they performed. Those that obeyed were principally <hi>Abraham</hi> himselfe: then also, all his other company besides. <hi>Abraham</hi> himselfe was the onelie Man that was called: and he obeied his call immediatly, presently yeelding himselfe to doe as the Lord required of him. His other company besides, were but his family with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any question for all but one: but one there was, who it may be, was not to bee ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken as one of his Family. Those that without question were of his Familiy, were <hi>Sara</hi> his Wife, and all his Seruants (together with their Wiues and Children also, as it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth) which how many they were, wee haue not set downe, but it seemeth they were a great company: both because a few yeares after, when <hi>Lot</hi> was parted from him, he was able to bring forth to the field aboue three hundred of his owne company (as af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward we shall see) and for that it was the manner of diuers in olde time so to trauell and soiourne abroad with great heards and flockes of Cattle great and small, and with <note place="margin">

So long as they stood free, the Story doth chiefly treat of the cheife and principall Fathers, <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Isaak, Iaacob</hi> and <hi>Ioseph:</hi> of which, the first two neuer but kept in the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> or neere vnto it; the others, spent much of their time abroade in other Countries. In the Story of those that neuer but kept in the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> or neere vnto it, wee are to consider, that some things there are, that doe more properly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaine to this course or order of Story that now wee are in: others againe, that doe not so fitly belong there-unto; but are rather to bee taken aside from these, or to bee handled apart by themselues. Those that do more properly appertaine to this
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:7530:41"/> course of Story that now wee are in, doe either respect their Seede: or themselues. That which chiefly respecteth their Seede, is but one; namely how God proceeded with these, in raising vp a people vnto him: and first with <hi>Abram;</hi> then after, with <hi>Isaak</hi> his Sonne. In <hi>Abram</hi> wee finde, that himselfe did first inordinately hast thereunto: but then, that afterward God brought it about in orderly manner. Hee did inordinately haste thereunto, when hee stept aside to <hi>Agar</hi> his seruant: wherein notwithstanding it shall be good to consider, first of the occasion thereof (that we may take the better heede:) then after, of the thing it selfe. The occasion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of doth seeme to rest on two principall pointes: one, that God had already tould him that hee should growe to so great a people; the other, that not onely <hi>Sarai</hi> his wife, but himselfe like-wise did therein leane ouermuch to humane reason. That God imparted that secret vnto him before, wee finde that very cleare, not onely in <note place="margin">Gen. 12. 2. Gen. 12. 7.</note> his promise at the first, to make of him a great Nation: but also, when the Land it selfe was promised, both at his first entring into it; and when that promise was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed vnto him againe. It was renewed twice before hee made this slip: once, so soone as <hi>Lot</hi> was parted from him, at which time it was also tould him, that his <note place="margin">Gen. 13. 14-17. Gen. 15. 4, 5. Ibid. 8. 21.</note> Seede should bee as the dust of the earth; then againe, when as to rescue <hi>Lot,</hi> hee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> had ouercome those foure Kings and all their forces, and then telling him likewise, that his Seede should bee as the Stars in heauen, and confirming the same vnto him by a solemne couenant. That they rested too much likewise on humane reason it appeareth plainely in <hi>Sarai:</hi> and reasonable plainely in <hi>Abram</hi> also. It appeareth plainly in <hi>Sarai,</hi> for that shee, euen in plaine termes, did so frame her reason (namely <note place="margin">Gen. 16. 2-3.</note> for that shee was barren, and God did giue him no Children by her) when both shee perswaded <hi>Abram</hi> to take that course, and afterward did her selfe bestow her seruant vpon him to bee his wife. It appeareth reasonable plainly in <hi>Abram</hi> also, for that thereupon he tooke <hi>Agar</hi> vnto him, and therein followed <hi>Saraies</hi> aduise. <note place="margin">Ibid. 2. 4.</note> So the thing it selfe is no more but this, that they being so many waies assured, that God did meane some Seede vnto him, and then considering the barrennesse of the one, and the great age of both, it may seeme, that as reason in such case would bee ready to infer, that there was no likelihood at all of the body of <hi>Sarai</hi> already, nor of his neither, vnlesse hee tooke it soone now: so they did likewise yeeld vnto it, and thereupon resolued to assay it by <hi>Agar</hi> their seruant, when now they had bin about <note place="margin">Gen. 16. 1-4</note> ten yeares in the Land, and as yet had no Childe at al, notwithstanding all those pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises before. An example plaine inough in it selfe, both of the great weakenes that it in vs: and how likely we are, if God doe at any time shew vs before, what good he doth meane vs, inordinately to hasten vnto it. So came it to passe, that whereas both <hi>Sarai</hi> did so far aduise him, and himselfe did so far yeeld thereunto, he lay with his seruant <hi>Agar,</hi> and got her with Child, who thereupon did beare <hi>Ismaell</hi> vnto <note place="margin">Gen. 16. 16.</note> him, when now hee was 86. yeares old. How God did afterward bring it about in orderly manner, it followeth in the Story, a few yeares after: first, how he gaue them knowledge of it; then, howe hee perfourmed the thing it selfe. In giuing them knowledge of it, wee are to consider both in what sort it was deliuered: and how hardly it was receiued. It was deliuered twice vnto them: first vnto <hi>Abram</hi> alone; then, vnto <hi>Abram</hi> and <hi>Sarai</hi> too. It was deliuered to <hi>Abram</hi> alone, what time as Circumcision was first ordeined: and shortly after, to them both together, when <hi>Abram</hi> did receiue those Angels that went to destroy those sinfull Citties. In that first deliuery of it, wee are to consider first of the occasion of it: then, of the deliuery it selfe. The occasion of it was, that God was now againe renewing vnto <note place="margin">Gen. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>: 1-14</note>
               <hi>Abram</hi> his former promise of giuing vnto him so worthy and so great a posterity: and for his better confirmation therein, both ordeined Circumcision vnto him to be a Sacrament of the same; and somwhat altered his name with all, by adding a syllable more vnto it (of <hi>Abram,</hi> making it <hi>Abraham)</hi> and did the like for <hi>Sarai</hi> also, though not altogether in the same manner, but only by withdrawing a letter from it. Vpon this occasion he told <hi>Abraham,</hi> that <hi>Sarai</hi> his wife should no more be cald <hi>Sarai,</hi> but <note place="margin">Gen. 17: 15, 16</note>
               <hi>Sara:</hi> and gaue in the reason of it, for that he would so blesse her, that of her he should haue a Son (notwithstanding that great age of them both) and that of her should <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:7530:41"/> come a mighty people, and among them euen Kings likewise. In that other deliuery of it we haue in like sort set down vnto vs, first the occasion of it: then, therewithall the thing it selfe. The occasion of it was, that when hee sawe passing by him as it were three way-faring men hee both earnestly intreated them to turne in vnto him, <note place="margin">Gen. 18: 1-8.</note> and withall gaue them such entertainment as then hee had, and thought meete for them. At which time though hee knewe none other at the first, but onely that they were but men; yet soone after he found that they were other manner of guests then hee was aware of: and the <hi>Apostle</hi> seemeth to haue that in remembrance, when ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting <note place="margin">Heb. 13, 2.</note> the bretheren to lodge strangers, hee saith that in so doing some had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued into their houses Angels vnawares. The thing it selfe is no more but this, that <note place="margin">Gen. 18: 9-15</note> they were eating, they enquired for <hi>Sarai</hi> his wife, and both tould him withall, that by that time twelue-moneth hee should haue a Childe by her: and reprooued her likewise for laughing at it, adding for confirmation thereof, that it should be done by the power of the Lord himselfe, vnto whome nothing should bee impossible. How hardly this promise was receiued of them wee haue likewise set downe vnto vs: <note place="margin">Gen. 17, 17, 18.</note> and first for <hi>Abraham;</hi> but then after for <hi>Sarah</hi> also. For when first this promise was made, then did <hi>Abraham</hi> both secretly laugh thereat with himselfe (and yet, as it seemeth, not of infidelity, but rather for ioy) and, as doubting somwhat of so good successe therein, he desired, in effect, that <hi>Ishmael</hi> might be he in whom God would vouchsafe to shew him that mercy: and yet by and by after, when hee was satisfied <note place="margin">Gen. 17, 23.</note> for that matter, he tooke vpon him and his, that part of the couenant that God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded, and so declared that in some measure hee did expect the accomplishment of it. So <hi>Sarah</hi> likewise, when this promise was againe renewed did in such sort laugh thereat, that the Lord did reproue her for it, as proceeding of some infidelity: <note place="margin">Gen. 18, 12-15</note> but being once reprooued, wee doe not reade that shee stood any longer in it, but haue some likelihood that in wardly she rather yeelded, for that she denied her-selfe to haue laughed, as her-selfe condemning it if so shee had done. And so may the faithfull now bee some-times likewise somewhat doubtfull of the promises of God towards them, and yet bee of the faithfull also, so long as in the end they preuaile in those conflicts of theirs. Howe he perfourmed the thing it selfe doth afterward follow; together with another thing so ioyned vnto it, that thereby the perfour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of this promise is made more cleerer. The thing it selfe was then perfour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, <note place="margin">Gen. 21, 18.</note> when according to the promise before, <hi>Sarah</hi> conceaued and bare him a Childe, when <hi>Abraham</hi> was nowe an hundred yeeres old, and <hi>Sarah</hi> herselfe foure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skore and ten: whome, according as God had bidden him before, he called <hi>Isaack,</hi> circumcised him at eight daies old, and after weaned him with speciall feasting. That other thing that is so ioyned vnto it, that thereby the perfourmance it selfe is made more cleere, is, that thereupon, or shortly after, both <hi>Ismael</hi> and his Mother too, were both cast out or sent away: wherein <hi>Abraham</hi> might more fully see, that God meant to perfourme all his whole mercy vnto him in his Son <hi>Isaack,</hi> when now by his commaundement hee must abandon his other Sonne <hi>Ismael.</hi> But because <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> this Story is of more speciall importance, therefore it shal be needful heere, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider somewhat further of it: and first of the cause or occasion of that his casting out; then, howe the same was thereon perfourmed. The occasion of it was, that <hi>Sarah</hi> sawe <hi>Ismael</hi> in such sort playing with <hi>Isaak,</hi> as did then offend her, and, which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the <hi>Apostle</hi> termeth persecution. So that it seemeth, that <hi>Ismael</hi> vnderstanding that <hi>Isaack</hi> was to bee preferred before him, hee did in such sort scoff at it, as in such case vngracious Imps are woont to doe: and it may be, that in the way of playing or dallying with him, he did further also bewray his griefe against the childe concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, as hardly brooking that himselfe should be defeated of his expectation, and of the loue that he saw his Father did beare him, had not this child now in his old daies beene borne vnto him. A right patterne, how hardly the childeren of the world, do at any time brooke the children of adoption and grace. This occasion being giuen, <hi>Sarah</hi> thereupon lay vpon <hi>Abraham</hi> to cast out or to send away, both <hi>Ismael</hi> and his mother withall: adding thereto, that with her sonne he should not inherit, nor part stakes with him there. Whereat while <hi>Abraham</hi> did somewhat sticke, he was
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:7530:42"/> admonished by God himselfe, that so hee should doe: and told withall, that hee also should grow to a mighty people, that so he might the better see that God had care of him likewise, though otherwise that couenant of speciall mercy hee would establish with <hi>Isaac</hi> onely. Whereuppon <hi>Abraham,</hi> did accordingly send them away as his Wife before desired, and God himselfe had now commaunded. A very good war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to all the Children of the World, how brittle an hold they haue in those thinges that they looke for with the Children of God: that how high soeuer they holde their heades among them, and often ouer-looke them now; yet one day the time will bee, when they must be sundered from them, and cleane cast out from that vaine expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of theirs.</p>
            <p n="4">4 In the Story of <hi>Isaac</hi> also the matter is plaine, that God raised vp no seede vnto him, but in long processe of time: and then left him but one neither; vnto whom also <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> he gaue no Issue but of long time after. Which that we may the better perceiue, wee are more specially to consider, first how God did exercise their patience in the meane season: yet, how afterward he did performe his promise vnto them. He exercised their patience in the meane season, first by seeming vtterly to cut off all hope of such mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: then, by holding them a long time after in suspense also. Hee seemed vtterly to cut off all hope of such matters, when hee called on <hi>Abraham</hi> for to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice his Sonne <hi>Isaac</hi> vnto him: concerning which wee are first to consider of the Story it selfe: then, what other thinges we are to gather out of the same. In the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry it selfe we are to see, how farre it pleased him, first to try him; then, how glad a man he afterward made him. Hee tryed him first, both in that which himselfe set downe: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and in one accident that fell by the way. In that which himselfe set downe, hee tryed him likewise both in the thing it selfe: and in the manner of prescribing the same. In the thing it selfe he did try him, in that he required of him, that he beeing the Father, <note place="margin">Gen. 22. 1. 2.</note> should neuerthelesse slay vnto him in the way of sacrifice, his Sonne <hi>Isaac</hi> whom his heart loued: in euery point (whosoeuer doth mark it) a strong temptation, and a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uellous heauy burthen. In respect of the manner that was prescribed, it was a strong temptation also, both because <hi>Ishmaell</hi> had nowe beene sent away before, and so had he none left but <hi>Isaac</hi> onely: and for that, God did not require it there presently for to be done, but appointed so great a distance of space thence (for it was so farre off, that it was the third day before that he saw it, and saw it not then neither but a farre off) as that in the meane season his fatherly affections, the strangenesse of the precept, the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturalnesse of the fact, the griefe of his Wife, the possibility of Issue in reason extinct, and such like doubtfull and pensiue thoughtes, might in the meane season passe too and fro in his troubled heart, and make the temptation so much the stronger, and the <note place="margin">Gen. 22. 7.</note> burthen heauier vnto him. That accident that fell out by the way, was, how his sonne questioned with him about his businesse, when they were but they two together, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing that yet they had nothing to sacrifice, and thereupon asking his Father, where, the sacrifice was that he meant to offer: little knowing that it was meant, it should bee himselfe; and (no doubt) sharply pricking the pittifull heart of his wofull Father, euen with the same question alone. How glad a Man he afterward made him, doth most of all appeare in the dealing of God towardes him: but partly also in his owne acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging of it. In the dealing of God towards him, there bee two matters of speciall moment: one, that God spared his Sonne vnto him; the other, that he promised other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise to be so good vnto him. In that he spared his Sonne vnto him, and that euen then, <note place="margin">Gen. 22. 9-12.</note> when now by likelihood hee had abandoned all hope to saue him, and when himselfe was now at the very point to dispatch him, it was no doubt more ioyfull vnto him, then any heart is able to conceiue, but onely to such as at any time are in such like manner exercised also. That further goodnesse that thereupon he promised vnto him, was, that <note place="margin">Gen. 22. 12. 15-18.</note> seeing now he had giuen so good a testimony that he did loue him indeede, he would surely blesse him accordingly for it: and so renewed his former blessing vnto him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine; and swore by himselfe, that fully hee would performe it vnto him. How farre <hi>Abraham</hi> acknowledged this goodnesse of God towards him, appeareth in this, that thereof he gaue the name to the place; namely, that in that Mountaine of the Lorde, <note place="margin">Gen. 22. 14.</note>
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:7530:42"/> the Lord himselfe would be sure to prouide: acknowledging thereby, that when him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe was so intangled with that perplexitie, and so ouerwhelmed with the sorrow and griefe thereof, that he could not tell which way to turne him, euen then it pleased God <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> much more graciously to bring thinges about, and to prouide for his quieting againe, then he could any way haue expected, or almost haue wished. Those other thinges that we may gather out of the same, are two: one, howe it was a figure of Christ; the other, how we are so follow the same. It was a figure of Christ in this, that as <hi>Isaacs</hi> life did now lie a bleeding, when his Father had bound him, and laide him vppon the Altar to slay him; but then notwithstanding hee came downe againe both safe and sound: euen so Christ was in deed sacrificed to God for our sins; but yet the third day he tooke vnto him his life again, and liueth for euer. So that in him it may most truely be said indeede, that God hath wonderfully prouided when otherwise wee were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passed about with the snares of death, and had beene vtterly lost for euer. As it is an example for vs to follow, we are to consider, what it is that wee should doe: and what Issue it is that therein wee might looke for. The thing that we should doe, is, in our calling, or so farre as God shall at any time require of vs, to part with our pleasure or ioy here, or whatsoeuer it is that is dearest vnto vs: and the Issue thereof that then wee may looke for must needes bee this, that God will not take our comfort from vs, and will besides bestow vpon vs much greater blessinges. In which case also the Lorde will not faile to prouide much better for all such, then they are aware of, and farre aboue their expectation. Hee exercised their patience farther also, by holding them in suspence long besides, in that it was so long before <hi>Isaac</hi> was married: and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward also before he had any Children. It was forty yeares before that he was marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: <note place="margin">Gen. 25, 20. Ibid, vers, 26.</note> and twenty yeares after, before that he had any Children also. Notwithstanding all which erist of time, we do not read that he vsed any ill meanes, or made any inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate hast, for the accomplishment of the one or the other. Wherein, the greater pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocation that in the iudgement of flesh and bloud he might account he had thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to (in respect of those promises of God that such a people of him should be raised, and among others that blessed one also, by whom all the Kindreds of the earth should bee blessed) the better example we haue therein, euer in all thinges patiently to attend the Lordes good leysure, had neuer to vse inordinate hast for the accomplishment of his good pleasure in vs. How yet notwithstanding he afterward performed his promise vnto him wee haue plainely set downe: first, for his marriage; after, for his Issue like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise. As touching his marriage we are to note, both how Wife and godly a care was taken by those that were dealers for him therein: and howe good successe it had, or how readily it did come on so soone as euer the time was come that God had appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. What wise and godly care was taken by those that were dealers for him in that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> matter, appeareth first in <hi>Abraham</hi> himselfe: then soone after, in his Seruant also. In <hi>Abraham</hi> himselfe wee finde first what course hee thought best for his Sonne in that matter: then, what order he tooke for the effecting of it. The course that he thought best for his Sonne therein, was, that he should not haue any Wife of the people of that Land wherein he soiourned, but of his owne Kindred that hee left behind him. The <note place="margin">Gen. 24, 3, 4.</note> reason whereof may seeme to be, for that God promising that land to his seede, it was most likely thereby that God was purposed to destroy them: and therefore that it was not good for any of his line, that had to await for so speciall a blessing, to match with those that were like to be so deepely accursed. The order that he tooke for the effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting <note place="margin">Gen. 24: 2-9.</note> of it, was, that both hee made choyce of a meete man for it (the eldest Seruant of all his house, and which had the rule of all that he had:) and did not onely earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly charge him, but also swore him, by the Lord of Heauen and Earth, to bee faithfull therein. In his Seruant it appeared likewise, both in the meanes that hee vsed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto: and in his dealing in the matter it selfe, when he came vnto it. The meanes that he did vse thereunto were of two sortes: one, more vsuall; another, but seldome vsed <note place="margin">Ge. 24. 10-14.</note> by many. The vsuall was, that he took with him both for <note n="*" place="margin">Ibid 32, 54.</note> company and <note n="b" place="margin">Ibid. 22. 53.</note> such things as he needed, what he thought conuenient to such a purpose in liberall manner: to the number of ten Camels; hauing all his Maisters goodes vnder his hands. That other that is more seldome vsed, was, that he resorted to God by prayer. Wherein, we are
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:7530:43"/> more specially to consider, not onely that hee prayed: but also what was the thing hee desired. In that he sought vnto God by Prayer, in the businesse that then hee had in hand, it ought to teach vs, not to go so loosely and want only about our marriage, as it is the manner of most men to doe: but with great aduisement, and in best manner to addresse our selues vnto it, and by Prayer to sue vnto God for his blessing therein. In the thing that he desired, we haue one point of it that is but general, and such as others that feare God, would, and doe in such case, vsually aske: namely, that hee would so prosper his iourny, as that therein he would extend his mercies to <hi>Abraham</hi> his Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster. But another there is, that is extraordinary and very rare; but yet such withal, as argueth a speciall point of godly wisedome in him that made his choice thereof: which was, that he craued that God would direct him to such an one, as when he should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a point of curtesie of her (which was, that hauing drawne a Pitcher of Water at a Well, whereby hee rested him and his Camels, shee would giue him leaue to drinke thereof) she should of her selfe willingly and readily offer him more then hee had cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, as to draw for his Camels also. Which indeede was such a point, as not onely might be a speciall token to him from God; but should argue withall, a Woman of spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall good disposition: and such as Christ himselfe did not finde in that Woman of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maria,</hi> when he asked a little Water of her to drinke when he was weary; but on the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
               <note place="margin">Iohn. 4. 5-17.</note> other side, much vnseasonable wrangling and gibing at her hands, to adde a great wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinesse vnto that which he had already. His dealing in the matter it selfe when it came to his handes, was partly heere by the Well where hee rested: and partly in the house where hee was to haue the Maide. In that his dealing which was heere by the Well, we haue the occasion first set downe: then, how he did follow vpon it. The occasion was, that the selfe-same token, which in his Prayer he had desired, was now giuen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him by <hi>Rebecca,</hi> a faire young Woman, that immediatly after his Prayer so made, came thither for water, and readily yeelded that curtesie vnto him, that in his Praier he had desired. So iust occasion being thus giuen, first he inquired further of her, of what stocke she was, and finding her to be of that stock that his Maister had prescribed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, he bestowed certaine Iewels vpon her, and bowed himselfe and gaue thankes vnto God: and then further inquired whether they had any lodging for him at her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers house. But then <hi>Laban</hi> her Brother vnderstanding thereof, and seeing the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wels that were giuen her, went forth vnto him, and intreated him and his company in. At which time how he behaued himselfe in the house, wee are now againe to consider, and that in two principall pointes: one, that when they had set meate before him▪ yet notwithstanding hee would not eate, till hee had done his arrant vnto them, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 word">

               </gap> seene some ende of his businesse; the other, that when his businesse was done, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>y could not intreat him to trifle out the time any longer with them. In both, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>in a good example to all other Seruants, howe to haue themselues in then Maisters busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse: so is it as strong a reproofe to many of vs that are of the Ministery, whose ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice when it pleaseth God to vse to get out among men a Spouse vnto Christ, we seeke not to God to blesse vs therein, nor put ornaments on those of whom wee may iustlie conceiue good hope; but readily giue our selues vnto feasting before that euer we do our businesse, and if wee speede some-what well sometimes, for the same wee wast much time besides. The successe that this businesse of marriage had, was answera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the wise and godly care, that on both handes was taken for it. As <hi>Abraham</hi> was perswaded, that God would blesse and prosper the action: so did hee nothing faile <note place="margin">Gen. 24, 7.</note> him therein. His Seruant prayed, and required a speciall token: scant had hee done: when the selfe-same token was giuen vnto him. As himselfe did see, that shee was a beautifull or a comely young Woman: so when he inquired of what linage shee was, he found her to be such, as his Mayster desired. The matter was no sooner propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> to her and her friendes, but that seeing the hand of God so plainely therein, they readily yeelded to all that was demaunded of them. The one day hee came thither a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout her, and till noon wist not where to heare of any such as he should haue: but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>re night he had his desire to ful contentment; and the next day went homeward with her. And howsoeuer it pleaseth God, sometimes for our tryall or needfull exercise, to holde
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:7530:43"/> vs off long, in diuers such cases: yet the time being come that hee hath ordained, thus readily can hee bring about, whatsoeuer hee meaneth to any of his. As touching his Issue, we haue there also set forth vnto vs, what meanes hee vsed to obtaine the same: then, howe farre it pleased God to blesse him therein. That hee vsed some speciall meanes to obtaine the same, it importeth that he was occasioned so to doe: and so are we to consider, first of the occasion that hee had thereunto; then, of the meanes that thereon he vsed. The occasion was no more but this, that his Wife was barren: and the meanes that thereon he vsed, was to pray for her vnto the Lord. How farre it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed <note place="margin">Gen. 25: 21.</note> God to blesse him therein doth likewise follow: namely, that it pleased GOD to graunt him his desire; but yet in such sort, as whereby he did somewhat exercise them <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> withall. He did graunt him his desire, in that shee did thereupon conceiue: and was afterward deliuered likewise of two Sonnes at one birth. In that exercise that he ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned withall, we are first to consider of it, as it touched them: then, as the same, giueth instruction to vs likewise. As it touched them, it did first respect herselfe alone: then both him and her together. That which respected her alone, was, that while she was with Child, shee perceiued some strange accident in her body, by the reason that the Children wherewith she went, stroue together in her Wombe, and shee could not tell <note place="margin">Ibid 22.</note> what to make of it: whereupon, being troubled therewith, she repaired to the Lorde, and so did vnderstand by him, what the matter did meane. That which respected them both together, was no more, but that in those Children the course of Nature or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <note place="margin">Cen. 25. 23.</note> order should bee a little inuerted: both for that they should bee deuided among themselues, and grow into two seuerall peoples; and for that the elder of them should be inferiour vnto the younger. As it giueth instruction to vs likewise, we learne ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, that dissention and variance may be euen in the Wombe of the Church it selfe, and among the Children of one and selfe-same venter: but there-withall (to the comfort of those that are of the Couenaunt) that the elder, and those that are heere clearely in the iudgement of flesh and blood, shall bee the lesse and inferiour to them in the fauour of God.</p>
            <p n="5">5 Hauing seene that which respecteth their seede, that is, howe leasurely, and in what processe of time it pleased God out of them to raise some people vnto him, with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> whome he would establish that speciall couenant that then he spake of: now are we in like sort to consider of such things as concerne themselues. And those are (as before I noted) but onely two: namely, of what desert they were towards God; and what estate, while here they liued, he vouchsafed vnto them. Of what desert they were to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, it were but vaine for any to search, as hoping to finde, that by some wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinesse that was in them, they had deserued these so great fauors of God: for because that, of that kinde it is most certaine, that we could finde none at all. But on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther side, our search must be, how vnwoorthy in themselues they were, and how great infirmities did breake forth in them: and yet notwithstanding, how it pleased God to worke forth in them diuers good graces, for himselfe to crowne with speciall fauour. Which things we haue most apparant in <hi>Abraham:</hi> but partly also in <hi>Isaac</hi> his sonne. As touching <hi>Abraham,</hi> we are in this respect to note, first such thinges as of this kinde to him appertaine before his calling: then, such others as appertain to the time that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed. Concerning those that belonged vnto him before his calling, those are espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially two: one, of his owne person; the other of his Marriage. Concerning his own person, it is to be noted, that we read of no speciall goodnesse or worthinesse in him, when first hee was called: but may rather doubt, that because his kindred were Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous, and he hitherto brought vp and liuing among them, and because that long after Idols was found in <hi>Iacobs</hi> family, he also might be such as was not altogether without al staine therein. For as for that which <hi>Iosephus</hi> setteth downe of <hi>Abraham</hi> as himselfe <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ant. l.</hi> 1. c. 8.</note> thinketh good, or but reciteth out of others <hi>(Berosus, Hecataeus,</hi> and <hi>Nicolaus Dama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scenus)</hi> or that others of later time are woont to alleage out of the <hi>Iewish Rabbius</hi> of <note place="margin">

               </note> his worthinesse, zeale, and open profession of the true God before, as diuers of these things doe shew themselues to be but fabulous; so the best of them also doe want the warrant of the written word: and both of them proceede of such Interpreters, as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:7530:44"/> were ignorant (at least in part) of that great goodnesse of God, that so often v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth so graciously to deale with those that nothing deserue that fauour. Concerning his marriage, it is the iudgement of many of the learned, that <hi>Sarah</hi> his Wife was the <note place="margin">Gen. 11. 29.</note> same that elsewhere is called <hi>Iista,</hi> and then was she his brothers daughter: and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe <note place="margin">Gen. 20, 12.</note> confesseth to <hi>Abimelek</hi> that she was his sister, hauing both one Father, but diuers Mothers. But if then such marriages, were not onely forbidden after by the law of God, but were also against the law of nature before, it cannot be auoided, but that such a marriage must needes be some speciall blemish vnto him. Concerning those others <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> that appertaine to the time that followed, we finde two speciall blemishes in him: one, that he denied his wife; the other, that he lay with <hi>Agar</hi> his bond-maid. In the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial of his Wife he offended twice: once, to <hi>Pharaoh</hi> the King of <hi>Aegipt;</hi> another time to <hi>Abimeleck</hi> King of <hi>Gerar.</hi> In both which he bewrayed infirmitie in him, both in the <note place="margin">Gen. 12: 11-13. Ibid. 20. 2. 11</note> occasion that he tooke so to doe: and in the thing it selfe that thereon he did. The oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion that he took thereunto, was the hard opinion that he had of both those peoples: and his owne feare ensuing thereon. The hard opinion that he had of both those peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, was in effect all one in them both: namely that there was so little feare of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, that they would not sticke to let themselues loose to inordinate lust, and to the accomplishment thereof in so full and licentious manner, as that bounds of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty should not be able to stay them. The feare that hee had ensuing thereon, was, that she being of speciall beauty, he thought if they did acknowledge themselues to be Man and Wife, some of them would not sticke to slay him, that so they might more quietly enioy her. The thing it selfe that thereon he did, was, that hee forsooke the iust defence of his Wife: and brought hoth her, and himselfe withall to deny a trueth; and to take such a course besides, as whereby her honesty was by themselues betrayed, had not God otherwise holpen, vnwitting to them. That hee lay with <hi>Agar</hi> his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant, though it were not any thing at all of the lusts of the flesh, nor without the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of his Wife; but rather that her selfe did first moue him vnto it, and but only there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to enter into the fruition of those promises of God that concerned his Seede: yet, in that Wedlocke was plainly broken thereby, it was so great and so foule a slip, as hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly might be thought at any time to bee found in such a one as hee. As touching <hi>Isaac</hi> his Sonne he also both denied his Wife, as his Father had done before him: and leaned <note place="margin">Gen. 26: 7.</note> ouer much to the course of Nature in seeking to preferre the elder of his Sonnes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <note place="margin">Gen. 27, 1-4.</note> the younger, when as God before had told them, that he had otherwise determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of them. Those good graces that it pleased God to work forth in them for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, <note place="margin">Cen. 25. 23.</note> to crowne with speciall fauour, are diuers also: which do most of all appeare in <hi>Abraham;</hi> but partly also in <hi>Isaac</hi> his Sonne. In <hi>Abraham</hi> we haue two sortes of them: some towards God; others towards men. Towards God a speciall good faith: and out of the same, proceeding both obedience vnto his word; and a thankefull ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging of his goodnesse towardes him. His obedience was seene, first in his owne country: then in the land of his pilgrimage also. In his owne country it appeared, in that when God did require it of him, hee left the same, (beeing then well strooken <note place="margin">Gen. 12, 4.</note> in age) and came to soiourne withall that he had in a strange Countrey. In the land of his Pilgrimage it appeared likewise, first in not sparing some part of his body: then, in not sparing his children also. It appeared in not sparing some part of his body, whē he took vpon him circumcision: which besides the losse of tbat part of the skin might well <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 17, 23-26.</note> be a further tryall to the iudgement of flesh and bloud, at all to meddle with any such couenant, as must haue the Scale therof imprinted on that part of the body, concerning which, euen nature it selfe doth by shame chace vs away, almost from all manner of dealing therewith, or speaking of it. In not sparing his owne Children, it appeareth also, first in <hi>Ismaell:</hi> then in <hi>Isaac.</hi> In <hi>Ismael</hi> it appeareth, for that though hee did <note place="margin">Gen. 17, 18. Ibid. 21, 14.</note> tenderly loue him: yet, at the commandement of God, he readily did it. In <hi>Isaac</hi> it appeared much more plainely, for that when <hi>Ismaell</hi> was sent away, and nowe none left but <hi>Isaac</hi> onely; in whom also the promise did stand of raising vp that Seede that God did speake of, yet euen then did hee yeelde to part with him also: and not onely simply (or howsoeuer) to part with him, but euen to offer him vp vnto death; and that to be done by his owne handes also. His thankfull acknowledging of the goodnesse of God towards him, was seene likewise when hee rescued <hi>Lot,</hi> and brought backe all
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:7530:44"/> the spoyle againe, both in that hee gaue to <hi>Melchisedek</hi> the Priest, the Tith of all: and especially when the King of <hi>Sodome</hi> requiring but his people againe, and yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that he should haue all the spoile, he would in no wise haue any part of it, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for this, least hee might seeme to haue beene made rich with those thinges that were theirs, and so that God should not haue all the whole glory of all his wealth and aboundance of thinges that he enioyed. Towardes men we finde in him good tokens likewise, that are very plainely recorded of him; some towardes a speciall Kinsman of his; others, towardes strangers besides. That speciall Kinsman of his was <hi>Lot,</hi> towards whom <hi>Abraham</hi> exercised the part of both of a Father for a time: and afterward of a good friend also. He exercised the part of a Father vnto him, in that he did not onely take him with him, but also (as it seemeth) dealt so faithfully <note place="margin">Gen. 13. 5, 6.</note> with him in his substance, that shortly after hee grewe so rich, that they could not both soiourne together, but were faine to part the one from the other. That after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward he exercised the part of a friend also, it doth plainely appeare, both in his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of parting with him; and that afterward hee did rescue him also. His parting <note place="margin">Gen. 13, 8.</note> with him was in such sort, that when there fell some disagreement betwixt their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, he both intreated him, that there might bee no disagreement betwixt them, being so neere of Kin as they were: and gaue vnto him the choice of the Countrey, that hee, though hee were inferior vnto him, should neuerthelesse make choyce in what in part of it hee had rather soiourne, himselfe contented and offering vnto him, to take such part of it as hee should leaue. That afterward hee did rescue him also, when by those Kinges he was taken away, therein we finde not onely a speciall loue <note place="margin">Gen. 14. 14. 15</note> to his Cozen: but also both valor, and wisedome too, in the performance or accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment of it. What care hee had of Strangers also, appeareth likewise, both in his intreaty for the sinfull <hi>Sodomites:</hi> and that he would in no wise be chargeable to the <hi>Hethites</hi> neyther. In his intreaty for the sinfull <hi>Sodomites</hi> wee see it was great, <note place="margin">Gen. 23. 3-20.</note> crauing, sparing of them if they had any reasonable number among them that had <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> care of vpright dealing: and therein descending by degrees, from fifty to tenne se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall persons; the Lord thereunto answering, that if but so many righteous persons were found among them, he would for their sakes spare all the rest. That he would in no wise be chargeable vnto the <hi>Hethites,</hi> it appeareth likewise, for that when <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah</hi> his wife was dead, and he was desirous to haue a place of his owne among them wherein to bury, though willingly they would haue bestowed that vppon him that he most desired without any Money; yet would he in no wise so take it of them, but with all reuerence refusing their liberalitie and curtesie towards him, he craued that he might giue them the worth of it, and so in that sort he tooke it of them, and then did bury <hi>Sarah</hi> therein. In <hi>Isaac</hi> we haue some things in like sort recorded, though <note place="margin">Gen. 22. 7.</note> (in respect of yeares that he liued, being 180. in all) they are but few: as that when he was to be sacrificed, hee knew so well what appertained to the seruice of God, that himselfe espyed what was wanting therein: another time, hee went out to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate: <note place="margin">Gen. 24. 63. 26, 25.</note> afterward, hee openly built an altar and worshipped: and though hee were much inclined to <hi>Esau</hi> at the first, yet when hee saw that God had turned that to <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> which he meant to <hi>Esau,</hi> wee would not then alter the same: and last of all, hee <note place="margin">27, 33.</note> gaue speciall charge vnto <hi>Iacob,</hi> as touching the choice of his wife, and then also did blesse him withall. Which things, if they seeme to bee fewer and of lesse mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <note place="margin">28, 1-4</note> then a man would expect, in such a compasse of time, of so great a Father as this (especially considering the diligence of <hi>Moses,</hi> in matters that are not of so great moment as these) he may doe well then to remember, that the lesse desert wee find in them towards God, the greater is the goodnesse of God, who yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing was gracious vnto them: and that it may bee, that euen for that cause hee would exercise and extend his goodnesse towards such, to teach vs to gather, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies his first mercies to vs are extended towards vs, altogether of his owne good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to vs, and nothing at all our deserts or goodnesse to him.</p>
            <p n="6">6 What estate, while heere they liued, he vouchsafed vnto them, may likewise be gathered, out of the Story that of them is left vnto vs: and it shall be good, so <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:7530:45"/> much the rather to consider of it, that we may the better know what portion in such things we also may looke for at the hands of God; and not by such ignorance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of as is in many, suffer our selues in expectation to aym at such matters as that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by wee sow to our selues the seedes of discouragement (and sometimes of dispaire) when after we finde not in those matters, God to be so good vnto vs, as wee in our owne vnaduised conceit, had thought that he would. And when wee finde that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> their estate in earthly thinges also was such as would content many of vs, if so wee might haue it; but on the other side, failing of it, we doubt that then we stand not in any fauor with God: in both these cases we are to consider, that the Church in those dayes was but young (and therefore so in those earthly things, to be dallied withall to their further training on, till they waxed more strong) that they also were chiefe and principall Fathers, and therefore that those things comming of the blessing of God might be much more due vnto them (by the course that God hath taken) then a tenth part of them, in like proportion, could bee due vnto vs; and that God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe might then be disposed, for many good causes, to bee, in those matters much better to them, then afterward hee would bee to those that should followe. Being in this sort aduised before, now may wee enter into a more speciall consideration of their estate: and first, what it was generally; then, what it was in diuers particulars. Generally, it was a meere pilgrimage to them both: and yet notwithstanding much eased vnto them. It was a meere pilgrimage to them both, in that they were among a strange people, and had among them neither house to dwell in, nor Land to occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie of their owne: but were to carry Tents with them, wherein to harbour them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues and theirs; and to feede their Cattle where best they might without anoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to those that did there inhabit. And so doth both God him-selfe terme that estate of theirs and <hi>Abraham</hi> likewise, did make none other reckoning of it. It <note place="margin">Gen. 15, 13, 17. 8. Gen. 23. 4.</note> was notwithstanding somewhat eased vnto them, both in those promises that then were made them of things that afterward should be done: and in their present estate besides. Those things that afterward should bee done, which well might ease the bitternes of their Pilgrimage now, were, that their posterity should there inhabit: and that they should mightily preuaile against their enemies. In their present estate besides they had like-wise to comfort them withall, two of those things that most men desire, and striue what they can to attain vnto them: namely great wealth; and speciall honour with the people that there did inhabit. Of <hi>Abrahams</hi> substance <note place="margin">Gen 13. 2. Gen, 13, 6.</note> or wealth it is said, not onely that hee was very rich in Cattle, and in Siluer and Gold: but also, that his wealth was so great, that <hi>Lots</hi> goods going with his (as for a time they did) the Land was not able to beare them both. Of which also there is a further proofe shortly after ensuing, in that for the rescuing of <hi>Lot,</hi> hee was able on the suddaine to bring foorth to the field 318. exercised men, or (as wee terme it) <note place="margin">Gen. 14. 14.</note> trained Souldiers, of his own family. That his honour also was great among them, it appeareth likewise, both with certaine of the <hi>Princes</hi> that dwelt thereby: and with those also that were of the Land where he did soiourne. Those <hi>Princes</hi> that dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling there by did him great honour, were <hi>Pharaoh</hi> King of <hi>Aegipt:</hi> and <hi>Abimelek</hi> King of <hi>Gerar,</hi> among the <hi>Philistims.</hi> The King of <hi>Aegipt</hi> had him in that reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, <note place="margin">Gen. 12: 19, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

The King of <hi>Gerar</hi> likewise, though he also had like cause of offence with <hi>Abraham,</hi> yet both hee <note place="margin">Gen. 20: 14, 15</note> gaue him many great guiftes (to win his fauour) and the liberty of all his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, to dwell where he list: and afterward also did seeke vnto him to be in league <note place="margin">Gen 21. 22 32</note> with him, euen for the honour and feare that he had him in. Of those that were of the selfe same Land where he did soiourne, first we finde that some honour was done vnto him without relation of any thing that was the occasion of it: then, much more by such occasions as then were offered. That which otherwise without recit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ll of <note place="margin">Gen. 14. 13.</note> any occasion was done vnto him, was, that those three Bretheren, which (as it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth) were principall men in those parts were not onely confederate or in league with him: but accordingly also went to war with him vnder his conduct, in that <note place="margin">Ibid. 24.</note>
               <pb n="67" facs="tcp:7530:45"/> voyage that <hi>Abraham</hi> made for the rescuing of <hi>Lot</hi> his Nephew. The occasions were two: one, that peece of seruice that was done vpon those foure Kings, which a little before had ouer-run a good peece of that Country; the other, his request to haue among them a burying place for him and his. When hee was returned from that aforesaid peece of seruice, the honour that then was done vnto him, was done by two Kings: the King of <hi>Sodom;</hi> and the King of <hi>Salem. Bera</hi> the King of <hi>Sodom</hi> (one of those fiue that were beaten and spoyled by the other foure) did both meete him when he returned, a great way off (for the Valley where it is said that hee did <note place="margin">Gen. 14, 17. <hi>Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 span">

Vpon his request to haue a burying place among them, both all the <hi>Hittites</hi> generally, and <hi>Ephron</hi> a principall man among them more specially, did not onely vse great reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence <note place="margin">Gen. 23. 3-16.</note> vnto him, and acknowledged him to be of speciall great dignity among them: but also gaue him free choise to bee where hee would, in the best that any of them had; and when hee had named the place vnto them, they would needes haue giuen it freely vnto him. Then comming to <hi>Isaak,</hi> wee may see, though his Story be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry briefly set downe, yet that hee also was very rich: and in speciall honour besides. That hee was very rich it doth plainly appeare, both for that <hi>Abraham</hi> left him (in <note place="margin">Gen. 25. 5.</note> effect) all that he had: and for that afterward also God did further so blesse him, that he waxed mighty, and still encreased till he was exceeding great. That he was <note place="margin">Gen. 26, 12-14</note> had in speciall honour besides, though it may sufficiently appeare in this that he was <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> so rich (for that it is the manner of all men generally, the greater that men are in such respect, the more to haue them in estimation) yet one other Story there is that doth more specially declare the same: namely that <hi>Abimelek</hi> the King of the <hi>Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stims,</hi>

               </gap>ll tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, so long as hee liued, but that euer hee had comfort mingled withall. And whereas the promise that God had made him, did rest in twoe principall points, one of the Land, the other of his Seed, we finde that his triall was also in those. And <note place="margin">Gen. 12. 10.</note> first for the Land (one good part of the promise of God) hee was almost no sooner entred into it, but that he was chased out of it againe, with a speciall discredit to the Land it selfe: namely, that Famine that then did oppresse it. Which also while hee sought to auoide, then was he asmuch troubled again with a perturbation of his own that arose thereupon: so great a feare euen of his life, that both himselfe denied his Wife (a manifest breach of no small part of the married mans duty) and made her <note place="margin">Gen. 12. 13.</note> likewise to doe the same. When he was returned againe, he was shortly after dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to aduenture his life, and all that he had, about the rescuing of <hi>Lot</hi> his Nephew: and he could not doe that neither, but that thereby needs must hee hazard the enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of those foure Kings and of their people, that now had taken him away; and bred <note place="margin">Gen. 14. 1. 9.</note> himselfe enuy at home likewise. That storme also was no sooner ouer-blowne, but that he found other trouble besides; both in his owne Family at home; and in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part of the Countrey likewise. In his owne Family he found himselfe charged by <hi>Sarah</hi> his Wife, with the ill dealing of her Maide, that dispised her Mistresse when <note place="margin">Gen. 16. 5.</note> her selfe had conceiued: whereas notwithstanding neither was hee (for ought that we read, and seeing he did no further defend her) iustly to bee charged with it; and
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:7530:46"/> herselfe had giuen the first occasion. That other part of the countrey besides, was that part where <hi>Abimelek</hi> the King of the <hi>Philistims</hi> dwelt: where while hee soiourned hee was troubled againe with that perturbation of the feare of his life altogether as deeply as he was before, and to his great reproofe withall. So likewise for his Seed, first hee <note place="margin">Gen. 20. 11. Ge, 20. 10. 16.</note> was kept so long from it, that not onely his Wife, but also himselfe, thought it needfull to make supply inordinately: and was full out one hundred yeares old, what time the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>

Whereas in the meane season <hi>Nachor</hi> his Brother, to whome there was no promise made, had nine in all, besides the Children of diuers of them: and hee on the other side, before he had any, in fearefull manner was giuen to vnderstand, that when <note place="margin">Gen, 15, 12, 13</note> he had them, they should be in hard estate vnder others for many yeeres. And when the time began to draw neere that now he should haue some part of the promised seed, first himselfe in that old age of his, and all his Meynie (of that Sex) must be circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed: a Sacrament neuer heard of before; and imprinted on such a part of the bodie, as <note place="margin">Gen, 17, 10, 11</note> that it must haue beene an hard matter for flesh and bloud, readily and soundly to yeeld vnto it. Last of all the promised Childe once being giuen him, both the other that hee had before (whom also he dearely loued) must first be abandoned and sent away: then the promised Childe likewise must be slaughtered by the handes of his Father (hauing <note place="margin">Ge. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

But yet in these did not God forsake him, but euer ministred comfort withall. <note place="margin">Gen, 22, 2,</note> Though in that Land he was touched with Famine, yet was hee prouided for in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Though himselfe stoode in such feare of his life, as that hee vsed inordinate meanes to preserue the same: yet was he vnder such a protection, as that he needed not so to fear; and so did it presently shew forth it selfe in plentiful measure. His life indeed <note place="margin">Ge, 12, 17-20.</note> he ventured for <hi>Lot,</hi> and (in reason) did hazard the mortall hatred of those Princes and people, that he subdued: but, besides the victory that he had gotten, the Lord himselfe <note place="margin">Gen. 14. 16. Gen, 15. 1</note> also bad him bee of good comfort, and to stand in feare of none of them all. In that domesticall blast of <hi>Sarah</hi> towardes him, God likewise so ordered the matter, that first by his owne discreet and moderate answere vnto her, the mallapartnesse of the seruant <note place="margin">Gen, 16, 6, Ibid, vers, 9,</note> was chastised: and then, when thereupon for a time she fledde, she was by the speciall commaundement of God brought home vnto her obedience againe. In that other perturbation of his, when againe he so feared to be made away for his Wife, that him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe denied her as afore, and caused her also to do the like: yet then likewise he found the protection of God so ready towards him, that as againe he might plainely perceiue <note place="margin">Gen: 20: 3-16.</note> that hee needed not so to haue feared; and yet not without some touch to himselfe. As touching those crosses that concerned his Seede, though he were kept long from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny: yet his expectation was often satisfied with those comfortable promises in the meane season; and it was so fully answered in the end, that thereby hee might well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count himselfe to be sufficiently recompenced for whatsoeuer delay was vsed before. And though then he heard of the hard estate of that race of his for a time: yet he heard <note place="margin">Gen, 15, 14,</note> withall, that after they should haue a notable deliuerance, and that the Lord himselfe would auenge the iniuries that were done vnto them. In his Circumcision there was nothing irkesome to flesh and bloud but onely the paine: or else, the shame, so farre to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> deale with that part of the body. The paine was not great, and that but for a fewe daies; and the shame was more than needed, when it was such a thing as God requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: and the matter being duely considered, both they were sufficiently recompenced <note place="margin">Gen. 17, 4-8,</note> in the Couenant that with them was thereupon made; and the nature of the Couenant was such, as that no other part of the body was so meete as it, whereon to imprint the seale of the Couenant. Though <hi>Ismael</hi> were to be sent away, and that must needs be some griefe vnto him: yet the promise that was made concerning him, was enough to counteruaile the other in plentifull measure. And as for the offering vp of <hi>Isaac</hi> (who <note place="margin">Gen. 21, 13,</note> now alone was left vnto him) God did no more but prooue him therein: and when it came to the point indeede, hee would not so take him, but sent him home with him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, <note place="margin">Gen. 22, 11 12, 15-18.</note> laden with great promises of wonderfull recompence for the same. The Story of <hi>Isaac</hi> is much shorter, and so doeth not yeeld vs so many examples as doth the other: but yet neither is it without for the quantity of it. For hee also was driuen out
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:7530:46"/> with a Famine (to the South-west corner of the Land) there to soiourne among the <note place="margin">Gen. 26. 1.</note>
               <hi>Philistims</hi> for a season; and there he also was in such feare of his life, that in the deniall of his Wife, hee did follow the selfe same steps that <hi>Abraham</hi> his Father had gon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: <note place="margin">Ibid. 7.</note> he therefore susteineth the like reproofe; and shortly after, is both required to get <note place="margin">Gen 26. 9. 10.

For though the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine droue him out of the heart of the Land: yet in that corner had God prouided wel enough for him, and gaue him encrease of an hundered fould. Hee was in feare, euen <note place="margin">Ibid. 10. 11.</note> of his life: but the euent declared, that it was much more than needed, and that there was more feare of God there, then hee was aware of. He was required to get him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way: but, both it was, for that by the goodnesse and blessing of God hee was growne <note place="margin">Gen. 26, 13. 14</note> so great; and those that then were weary of him, did shortly after themselues seek vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <note place="margin">Ibid. 22. 32 33 Ibid. 24.

As touching his Childeren albeit the time were somewhat long before hee had any: yet then he had two at once; and each of them did afterward grow to a seuerall Nation. And though in his owne purpose he were beguiled: yet because therein he yeelded so much to the vsuall course of nature, that he went against that ordinance of God, that was before determined of them, hee was more quietly to beare it; and God besides did mightily blesse the other <note place="margin">Ibid. 23.</note> also. Last of all, though his younger sonne were long away from him: yet afterward he returned notably blessed, both in Childeren and goodes besides. His Childeren <note place="margin">Gen. 32. 9. 10.

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> were, twelue Sonnes, and one Daughter: and for his goodes it is plainely saide, that hee was encreased exceedingly, and had many Flockes, and Maid-seruants and Men-seuraunts, and Cammels, and Asses. Which also whosoeuer woulde more specially know, he might easily gather a scantling thereof, by the present that he sent to his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Esau:</hi> namely two hundered Shee-Goates, and twenty Hee—Goates; two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered <note place="margin">Gen. 32, 14. 15</note> Ewes, and twenty Rammes; thirty Milch-Cammels, with their Colts; forty Kie, and ten Bullocks; twenty Shee-Asses, and ten Foales. For where such store was sent for a present, there must the whole stocke be maruailous great.</p>
            <p n="7">7 Those other thinges that we haue in the Story of these, of which I said a little <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> before, that wee must take them aside from the others, or to handle them apart by themselues, doe most of them appertaine to the Storie of <hi>Abraham:</hi> but some of them also, to <hi>Isaac</hi> his Sonne. In the Story of <hi>Abraham</hi> we haue some other things concerning his life: and somewhat likewise concerning his death. Concerning his life, some there be that doe but concerne his earthly estate there: but some others there are, that are of higher consideration. Those that concerne his earthly estate there, are two: one, concerning his manner beeing among them; the other, moe Children which he afterward had. In his manner of beeing among them, first his aboad seemeth for the most of his time at the first, to haue bin only as soiourning for some short time, now here, now there, as himselfe thought good, or as occasion was offered vnto him: but that after he made, when he grew more olde, in such places as wherein he did soiourne a longer time. That at the first he made his aboad in those places wherein he came but onely for some short time, it appeareth, for that we read of diuers times that so he did: and for that the Lord himselfe (after that <hi>Lot</hi> was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted <note place="margin">Gen: 12. 6. 8, 9 2, 3, 18.

That afterward when his age was greater, he rested longer where he did soiourn, it appeareth likewis, for that it is said, that he remained a long season among the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>listims</hi> (which may seeme to bee at <hi>Gerar,</hi> or neere vnto it;) and for that it is shortly after saide likewise, that <hi>Abraham</hi> did dwell at <hi>Beersheba;</hi> where dwelling, likewise may well import a long aboad. Then, though hee were a stranger among them; yet did he not altogether keepe aloofe from them, nor estrange himselfe so farre, but that he was in league with diuers of them, as by other occasion wee haue before: an

Those that are of higher consideration, are of two sorts: some, that doe concerne himselfe or his; and some, that doe concerne others besides. Those that doe concerne but him and his, were certaine speciall fauours of God towardes him: and those were, either in those promises that hee made vnto him; or in the meanes that he did vse to confirme him therein, that by infidelity he should not leese the benefit of them. Those promises that hee made vnto him, were either of the Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue that he would giue him: or the Land, whither now he called him. For his Issue it was promised, first for them all, or the whole body of them generally (meaning <note place="margin">Gen. 22. 2. 13, 16▪ <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Concerning the Land, whither now hee was called, that also did hee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, that he would giue to him and his in time to come. The meanes that hee vsed to confirme him therein, were diuers: first by a speciall Seruaunt of his; then, by <note place="margin">Gen. 12. 7. 13. 14, 15, 17, 15, 7</note> himselfe. In that first hee did it by one speciall Seruant of his, wee are to consider, first of such thinges as belong to the substance of the comfort that was giuen vnto him: then of some circumstances thereunto appertaining. Those thinges that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the substance of it, are two: one, that came of his liberalitie; another that came of a principall spirit. That which came of his liberality, was, that he brought forth Bread and Wine vnto <hi>Abraham:</hi> belike, not onely a token of his good-will <note place="margin">Gen. 14, 18.</note> towards him; but also, both to do him that honour, and to refresh him and his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, vpon their returne from that their voyage. For as touching that which diuers haue gathered heereupon, to draw this fact of his vnto an oblation or offering, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that hee was a Priest of God: seeing that it hath no warrant in the word that there is vsed, by the propriety of the tongue it selfe, therefore we are not to trouble our selues with it. That which came of a principall spirite, is the blessing that then he vttered: wherein first he pronounced <hi>Abraham</hi> to bee a blessed man, and to haue <note place="margin">Ge. 26, 19. 20.</note> that blessing of his from the most high God, possessor of Heauen and Earth; and then blessed that most high God likewise, for giuing that victory vnto <hi>Abraham</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer those his enimies. The circumstances are two: one, of the time; another of the person that did it. That of the time was, that then hee had this blessing giuen him, when as he returned from that his voyage, wherein because by his doings and good <note place="margin">Gen. 14. 17, 18</note> successe therein, he might easily prouoke both enmity abroad of those that he spoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and enuy at home of his Neighbours there: therefore of necessitie must this blessing come vnto him so much the more welcome, because it came in so fit a sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. The person that did it, or by whom it pleased God to bestow this blessing vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, is (as it seemeth) deliuered vnto vs, not by his owne, or proper name; but by an appellatiue: being called <hi>Melchi-zedek,</hi> and King of <hi>Salem;</hi> but beeing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede (as is most likely) that most reuerend and honourable Patriatke, the Sonne <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 14. 18.</note> of <hi>Noah,</hi> that is knowne by the name of <hi>Sem.</hi> Of which point, although I know there is question, not onely among the learned now, but also among the learned of olde: yet, as I take it, there neede to be no doubt conceiued, of those that will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently ponder the weight of argument, that is for the opinion of those that do account the same to be <hi>Sem.</hi> And then, if it pleased God to vse so honourable a Patriarke to the better confirming of <hi>Abraham</hi> his seruant: needs must the comfort
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:7530:47"/> be so much the greater. Whereas therefore he is there said to be a king of a principal Citty thereby, called <hi>Salem</hi> then, but <hi>Ierusalem</hi> since, &amp; a righteous King <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>sides, (for that is the interpretation of his name) and, besides this his Royaltie, w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> also a Priest of the Liuing God; hence doth it follow, that the comfort that he shold giue, should in both those respects be very great: that so great a man, &amp; so good a Prince, should deale with <hi>Abrahā</hi> so as he did; and that a Priest of the highest God, shold so behaue himselfe vnto him. When he came himselfe to do it, there we finde, that first he did it vpon occasion offered by <hi>Abraham;</hi> then, againe, of himselfe alone. Where as he did it by occasion offered by <hi>Abraham,</hi> we are to consider, both of the occasion that <hi>Abrahā</hi> gaue: &amp; how God therupon did confirme him therin. <hi>Abrahā</hi> gaue occasion twice a once, for his seed; another time, for the land that was promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed. And God likewise did confirm him therein; first for his seed: then, for the land. In the former of these, the occasion that <hi>Abrahā</hi> gaue to be further confirmed, was that when God by occasion had made him promise of speciall fauour, he thereupon <note place="margin">Gen. 15. 2, 3:</note> replyed, that seeing he had no child, but a stranger must be his heire, such speciall fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour proceeding from God, could be to little vse vnto him. For that may seeme to be his meaning, then that he inferred, that he might looke for no great fauour, when as he had not yet so much as a childe to succeede him, but must bee faine to make his seruant his heyre. That occasion being offered; we are to note what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation or strengthening was giuen him: and therein, not onely how God at the first did giue it; but also, how he did euen then reward the faith of <hi>Abraham</hi> for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting thereon. The manner that he vsed in giuing the same, was that he told him, <note place="margin">Gen. 15: 4 5.</note> that he should not neede to make that stranger his heyre for want of children: and therewithall bringing him forth in a starry night, and willing him to looke vp, and to tell the Starres if he could, he tolde him that the seede that he should haue should be so many, that they also could not he numbred. The reward that <hi>Abraham</hi> had <note place="margin">Gen. 15, 6.</note> for beleeuing the same, was, that it was accounted to him for righteousnesse: out of which the Apostle gathereth matter of great moment, for our free Iustification by <note place="margin">Gal. 3: 17.</note> Faith, altogether without the workes of the Law. In the latter of them, the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion that <hi>Abraham</hi> gaue him, was, that when God againe tolde him that hee had brought him out of <hi>Vr</hi> of the <hi>Caldes</hi> to giue him that land to inherit, he thereupon <note place="margin">Gen. 15. 7, 8.</note> did aske him againe, whereby he should know that he should inherite. Where we note by the way, that the Fayth of <hi>Abraham,</hi> which is commended (and that most <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> worthily) and so rewarded a little before: yet notwithstanding may seeme, in this matter to haue some doubting now. The confirmation that heereupon was giuen vnto him, was by a set and speciall Couenant that God would make with him. For which cause God willed <hi>Abraham</hi> to prouide such thinges, as whereby men were <note place="margin">Gen. 15. 9. 21.</note> wont to enter into a set and solemn Couenant one with another: and then did make the Couenant accordingly with him. Which if we thinke good more specially to consider, then may we note, first that God would haue these things prepared: then, what vse was afterward made of them. In the preparation of them are these two: that GOD himselfe did so require; and that <hi>Abraham</hi> did accordingly. In <note place="margin">

In that <hi>Abraham</hi> did according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it sheweth not onely his obedience therein: but also (and a matter worthie the noting) that although his faith were great, and so is to vs commended; yet did hee not thinke good to refuse this further strengthening that God did meane him. A needfull lesson for many of vs, that vpon the presupposed strength that alreadie wee haue, we little vse any of those meanes that God hath giuen vs, whereby to streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then our weakenesse withall. Comming to the vse that afterward was made there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, there do we finde, that some part of it was accidentall, and not seeming to bee meant vnto it: but all the residue, such as doth so fitly accord with the businesse that was in hand, as that it may well be accounted more proper vnto it. That which was but accidentall, and not seeming to be meant vnto it, was, that when <hi>Abraham</hi> had diuided those Beasts, and laide both them and the Fowle in order, awayting
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:7530:48"/> when the Lord would come and go betwixt them, as the manner was, certaine raue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Fowle did prey vpon them, so that <hi>Abraham</hi> was faine to tend the same, and to <note place="margin">Gen, 15. 11.</note> driue them away: a figure belike (and so is the iudgement of diuers) how readie the enemies of the people of God would euer be to prey vpon them, especially when they should seeme to be forsaken or rent in peeces; and yet that in no wise they may hope to rest vppon them, for that they haue a strong defender, and one that doth continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally tend them. And that it was <hi>Abraham</hi> that droue them away, it may signify vnto vs, that seeing it pleased God to make that Couenant with him, hee dooth after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward so accept of him to such purpose (and much more of Christ) as that for his sake, he euer bestoweth that goodnesse vpon them. Of that which doth so fitly accorde with the businesse that was in hand, as that it might well be accounted more proper vnto it, some part of it sheweth how God dealt with <hi>Abraham</hi> a little before the Couenant: then, how he made the Couenant it selfe. In the former we are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, first how it pleased God to affect <hi>Abraham</hi> before: then, what after hee sayde vnto him. That wherewithall hee did affect him before, was an heauy sleepe: and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 15. 12.</note> very fearefull darknesse withall. That which God after said vnto him, is altogether propheticall, and concerning him and his Seede: concerning which, first hee setteth downe their estate for a certaine time generallie; then, doth he more fully open cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine particulars thereunto appertaining. Their estate is so set downe, that some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinges are grieuous and heauy: and some others againe, of speciall comfort. Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous <note place="margin">Gen. 15, 13.</note> and heauy needs must it be, when he told him, that for a surety his seed should be not onely a Stranger in a forraine Countrey, and that for the space of foure hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yeares: but also, that they should bee in bondage vnto them, and intreated ill at their hands. Comfortable it was likewise, that God himselfe would punish those <note place="margin">Gen, 15, 14.</note> that intreated them ill: and that afterward he would bring them forth againe with great substance. Those particulars that belong thereunto, which afterward he doth more fully open, are two: one, concerning <hi>Abraham</hi> himselfe; the other concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his Seede that followed. That which concerneth <hi>Abraham</hi> himselfe, was that this affliction should not touch him, but that hee should goe to his Fathers in peace, <note place="margin">Gen. 15. 15.</note> and be buried in a good age. That which concerneth his seede, was, that they also in the fourth generation should returne thither againe: and a reason giuen there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall <note place="margin">Gen. 15, 16.</note> why it should not be by and by, for that the iniquity of the <hi>Ammorites</hi> was not full.

Of himselfe he did it a while after, when <hi>Abraham</hi> was ninety yeares old and nine: and that, both by changing their Names; and by ordaining circumcision withall.

               <hi>high Father,</hi> him now he called <hi>Abraham,</hi> that is, <hi>a Father of a multitude, or of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny:</hi> then, comming to <hi>Sarai,</hi> that is, <hi>My Lady or Mistris,</hi> her now he called <hi>Sara,</hi> that is a <hi>Lady or Mistresse.</hi> In ordaining of Circumcision we are to note, first that he would yet further confirme him thereby: then, in what manner hee did the same. That God would further confirme him thereby, after all those promises made, and so often repeated, and now after the changing of both their names likewise, out of it we may fruitfully gather, that in matters of difficultie it is hard for men to beleeue, in such confidence and strength, as they ought to doe; when as God himselfe, that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth what is in vs, worketh so hard vpon vs therein: and then, if <hi>Abraham</hi> needed so strong confirmation, who notwithstanding before had shewed, in diuers great trials, so notable and so rare a Faith, what staggering may not we doubt in our selues, if neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently we vse those meanes that the wisedome of God hath prescribed vnto vs, and if wee doe not carefully labour to strengthen our selues the best that we can? In his manner of doing the same, we are to note two principall matters: one, how fit a signe he tooke vnto the purpose that hee had in hand; the other, how farre hee would haue <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> the same to extend. The purpose that he had in hand, was some part of it but likely onely: and some part of it were certaine. That part of it that was but likely, was that God may seeme to haue had some meaning to humble <hi>Abraham</hi> himselfe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, and all his people that should afterward followe: and therefore that hee made choice of that part of the body, as whereunto reason would hardly yeeld. Certaine it is not, because we haue there no warrant for it, that then he had any such meaning: and yet notwithstanding it is likely enough, both because God is wont so to deale, and our Nature doth so require; and for that there be of our best Interpreters that so doe take it. And then out of it we are to gather, euer to haue all our senses, and all the powers and faculties of man generally, in all thinges subiect vnto the will and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of God: for that the dealing of God with his people is wont to be such, as that otherwise we are like in all thinges almost to stumble. That part of it that is certaine, <note place="margin">Ge, 17, 10-11.</note> that he meant to haue it a signe of the Couenant that he made with them: which Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant was recited a little before; namely, that both he would make him so fruitefull, that out of him he would raise many Nations (and among them Kinges likewise) and <note place="margin">Ibid, 6, 7.</note> that he would be God vnto him, and to his seede after him. In which respect (name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of such a propagation which was the chiefe part of the Couenant then) none other part of the body could haue beene so meete as it, whereon to imprint the Seale of that Couenant. How far he would haue the same to extend, is by himselfe plainly set down; namely, to all the Males of that Familie of his; and therein, euen to the Childe that was eyght daies old. Wherein it shall be good more specially to note, first on whom hee did not lay it: then on whom hee would haue it to lie. Those on whom he would not lay it, were all others that were none of that people, and among themselues, the
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:7530:49"/> Women-kinde also. In that hee did not lay it on any, but onely on those that were of that people, we may to good vse note (as others also haue done before) that we and others of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> when wee receiued the Law of God, were not bound vnto this circumcision, by this ancient ordinance of God: and therefore that no body neede in such case to make any conscience of obseruing the same; though otherwise there be some other places, that (not beeing taken by the originall) may seeme to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the same of all. Women also may seeme therein to be spared, not onely in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of that other ceremony of Purification, which was afterward by the Law cast vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them: but also, for that (betwixt the Male and the Female) such propagation doth originally or first proceede onely of the Male, and not of the Female but secondarily. Out of which there be that gather, that originall sinne is from the Man, and not from <note place="margin">Catena Alois<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

For if Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall sinne proceede but from the Father (and therewithall the better part of man like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise) and onely the Body or the inferior part of Man from the Mother: then haue we <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> a reasonable good light therein, how the Incarnation of Christ, may be without sin, seeing that hee tooke but Flesh of the blessed Virgine, and had not Man, but the most holy to performe that which otherwise by course of Nature is done by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Whereby also it may appeare, that Men neede not so to labour to get the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Virgine also to be without sinne, that so they might finde, how Christ might take his Flesh of her, and yet not haue it stained with sinne vnto him. For by this wee are taught to gather, that sinne proceedeth from the Soule or inward Man: and that the Flesh or Body is stained from it, or by the vniting thereof vnto it. Those on whom he would haue it to lie, were all the Males of that people: not excluding little Children therein. If all that were of that people must vse it: we also may in no wise account vs the people of God, vnlesse we despose our selues to obserue whatsoeuer ordinances he giueth to vs. If it were to bee imprinted on Children also, who neuerthelesse were vnmeete for procreation as yet: wee also neede not to doubt, but that, in the way of any Couenant of God, we may haue good hope, whatsoeuer vnlikelihoodes may be for the time. And if yet they were therein forborne for a time: we also may learne, both to beare with the weaknesse of others; and if ours dye, before they may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniently haue the Seale of the Couenant (as no doubt many of theirs did, before they were eight daies old) nothing to doubt of their estate towardes God thereby. Those that doe concerne others besides, were some of them neerer to <hi>Abraham:</hi> but other<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Those that were sundred from him, was first of all <hi>Lot:</hi> then, a good while after, both <hi>Ismael</hi> his Sonne, and his Mother withall. In the sundring of <hi>Lot</hi> from him, wee haue both the occasion of it set downe: and in what sort it was performed. The occasion of it was, that both <hi>Abraham</hi> and hee were growne so rich, that they could not both <note place="margin">Gen. 13, 5-9.</note> dwell together: a good example, how hard it is, for those that are rich to keepe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: and how good a Tutor or Gardian <hi>Abraham</hi> was to his Nephew <hi>Lot.</hi> For if <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Lot</hi> could not do it, it is like to bee much more hardly performed by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. In what sort it was performed, resteth in two principall points: one, that <hi>Abrahā,</hi> though the elder and greater, yet did he giue the other his choyce; the other, that <hi>Lot</hi>

In that that <hi>Abraham</hi> was so moderate, and condescended so farre vnto his Inferior, it layeth before vs a good example, for all men in such like cases to follow. In the choice of <hi>Lot,</hi> although it were indeede the fairest in the iudgement of Flesh and bloud; yet, afterwardes proouing so ill as it did, it may teach vs likewise, that in such case wee may chuse the fairest in sight, and yet haue the worse if wee lay thereunto the proofe of it after: and seeing, that euen at that time also it was certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">Gen. 13. 13.</note> knowne, that the inhabitant<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="75" facs="tcp:7530:49"/> of those two others wee finde, that first it was attempted by <hi>Agar,</hi> before that euer the Child was borne: but afterward effected indeed, by the appointment of God himselfe. When it was attempted by <hi>Agar,</hi> before that euer the Childe was borne, it was crossed or made voyde by God himselfe, and she returned home to her Mistris againe: and so for this matter, wee haue it more specially declared, both how farre her selfe did attempt it; and in what sort God did crosse it. In her attempting of it, first we haue the occasion set downe: then, how she did worke thereupon. The occasion was, that <hi>Sarai</hi> her Mistris now began to deale hardly with her concerning which, we <note place="margin">Gen. 16, 6.</note> haue likewise set downe, both vpon what reason she did it: and what order shee vsed therein. The reason whereupon she did it, was, that <hi>Agar,</hi> after that shee had concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by <hi>Abraham</hi> her Maister, now began to despise her Mistris: a matter that is so oft in experience (in cases that are some-what of that kinde, but yet much farther <note place="margin">4</note> from the right of any allowance then this) as that we neede so much the lesse to stand vpon it, and yet is it good to such ende to marke it. The order that shee obserued therein, was, that first shee opened her minde vnto her Husband, and had his good <note place="margin">5</note>
               <note place="margin">6</note> leaue therein, before she did any thing vnto her Seruant. That so she first acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted her Husband with it, and had his expresse licence therein, that was a course of good moderation, and good patterne for married Women in such case to followe. But that she seemeth to haue made that complaint to her Husband impatiently, char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging him to be some cause thereof (which notwithstanding she quickly found to be otherwise) in that she committed a double fault: one, that so wrongfully shee char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged <note place="margin">Gen. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

The occasion being so farre giuen <note place="margin">3</note> by her Mistris, she thereupon fled or ranne away from her: wherein we are to note, <note place="margin">6</note> not onely that so she did; but also in what manner shee did it, fleeing into the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernesse it selfe. In that so shee did, shee shewed her selfe little to regard, that her selfe had iustly deserued, that her Mistris should in such sort vse her, for that so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to her duty she had made so light of her. In that shee fled into the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, <note place="margin">4</note> it sheweth, how desperately she did, or how little regard shee had then of her selfe, that did not put her selfe in seruice to some other, nor sought to soiourn among the people, or in some Cittie: but so abandoned her selfe to the solitary and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous <note place="margin">Gen. 16, 17.</note> Wildernesse; or at the least, tooke that way home-ward to <hi>Aegipt,</hi> which as it seemeth was not the nighest, and, beeing alone, very dangerous also. How it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed God to crosse it, is in such sort set downe vnto vs, as that first we haue set down, how the Angell of the Lord dealt with her in that matter: then, how farre shee did yeelde thereunto.

Concerning that present matter, first he sear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth out in what case she standeth: then he doth prescribe vnto her, what she shall doe.

He inquireth of her, both whence she came, and whither she would: so to gather her to a better consideration, both that she left the place that she should not; and that vnaduisedly she had entered this iourney, not knowing her selfe whither she went, or able to giue no reason of it. And we in like sort are euer to marke what our estate or condition is, and constantly withall patience to abide therein: and to know withall, that if at any time wee leaue it, we know not then whither we goe, neyther are able to giue any reason for our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooue. In the answere that she gaue vnto him, she acknowledgeth her selfe to bee <hi>Saraies</hi> Seruant; and answereth but the first part of the question onely; namely, that shee fled from the face of her Mistris: so acknowledging her fault therein; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing (in effect) withall, that she was going shee wist not whether. That which the Angell doth hereupon prescribe vnto her, resteth in two principall pointes, one, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to her Mistris againe; the other, to submit her selfe vnto her: a very good pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:7530:50"/> of the dutie of all, in all such cases. That other matter of greater moment was concerning the good purpose of God towards her, in those should come of her: first, how great a posterity she should haue; then, concerning that very Child wherwith she went then. Her posterity he told her, should be very great: and so many that they <note place="margin">10.</note> could not be numbred. Concerning that Child wherewith she went thē, first he spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth vnto her of some things appertaining to his birth or first cōming into the world: then, of some others that shew what kind of one he should afterward be. Those that appertain to his birth, or first comming into the world, are two: one, that shortly she should be deliuered of him; and the other, by what name shee should call him. In <note place="margin">11,</note> the former of which, her folly is reasonable plainely rebuked, that being so neare her time as she was, she put her selfe to the hazard of such a iourney <gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> impatiencie al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, in that beeing so neare the time of her deliuerance, which was like to winne her fauour of all, yet she did not beare for a time, especially being then so short as it was, and her selfe of necessity needs must know it. In the latter, we may also note the goodnesse of God, who himselfe being so great, doth neuerthelesse so graciously re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard them: and the better to fasten this in the heart of this desolate Woman, did impose that name to her Childe, that should signifie so much vnto her. Those that are to shew what kinde of one hee should afterward be, doe shew what hee should be first in himselfe: then, towards other. For himselfe, it is said, that hee should be a fietce and sharpe man: as indeede such are the Childeren of the flesh, towards the Childeren of the couenant: and meetest for God wherewithall to exercise his <note place="margin">12.</note> Children. What he should be towards others, wee haue set downe in these two: one, that his hand shoulde bee against all Men, and all Monnes handes likewise a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him againe, (and such peace is there euer betwixte the Childeren of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="L"/> the worlde, and the true Childeren of GOD;) the other, that (notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding) hee should encrease and prosper, euen in the face of all his bretheren, as ours also do for many of them, euen to the discouragement sometimes of the faithful. How farre shee yeelded hereunto, appeareth in these two: first how thankfully she re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued <note place="margin">Psal. 73, 2-14.</note> this warning and fauour of God; then, in her returning to her Mistresse againe. Shee receiued that warning and fauour of God so thankfully, that she made the place it selfe a memoriall of it, by the name that she gaue it: not onely to her-selfe; but euen to the people that did afterward followe. A good patterne for vs, so to aduance the <note place="margin">Gen 16, 13, 14</note> glory of God in our time, that it might liue among those that succeede vs, when wee are gon. That shee returned to her Mistresse againe, it is not here in plaine tearmes recorded: but yet notwithstanding plainely implyed in that it is afterward saide, both that she brought forth her Sonne vnto <hi>Abraham,</hi> and that <hi>Abram</hi> gaue it the name. A good example for vs likewise, if at any time wee haue slipped or started aside, from <note place="margin">15</note> our duty or calling, yet in some good time to returne vnto it againe. How it was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward effected indeede, and by the appointment of God himselfe, to the ende that we may the better conceiue, we are first to note the occasion of it: then, to come to the thing it selfe. The occasion of it was, that <hi>Ismael</hi> did laugh, or mocked <hi>Isaac:</hi> which the Apostle accounteth a kinde of persecution, and saith that so it was then also; <note place="margin">Gen. 21. 9. Gal. 4, 29.</note> as we in like manner doe finde that so it is still: namely, that Hipocrites in the Church of God (as <hi>Ismael</hi> in the house of <hi>Abraham)</hi> are euer grieuous to the true Childeren of God. In the the thing it selfe wee are to note two principall matters: one the pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment that it brought vpon them; the other, the moderation wherewith it procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. In the punnishment that it brought vpon them we are giuen to vnderstand, first what it was: then, howe it proceeded. It was the casting of them both out of the <note place="margin">Gen. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>1, 9-14.</note> doores: as our mockers also may not euer haue place in the Church of God. The course of proceeding was, first that it was of <hi>Abraham</hi> required: then, that it was by him perfourmed. Of <hi>Abraham</hi> it was required first by <hi>Sara:</hi> then, by God himselfe. When <hi>Sara</hi> did require it, we are to see both in what sort she did require it; and what effect it tooke with <hi>Abraham.</hi> When she did require it, shee did it in such tearmes, as that it may seeme, that there was some businesse betwixt them about the right of <note place="margin">Gen. 21. 10.</note> the inheritance, because <hi>Sara,</hi> when she required that the bond-Woman and her Son
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:7530:50"/> should be cast out, shee added withall, that the Sonne of the bond-woman should not inherit with her Sonne: which it may seeme <hi>Agar</hi> was practising; and that the Boy himselfe, being now about foureteen yeares old, was by her induced to aspire vnto it. So the Sinagogue and her children are euer ready to encroach vpon the right of those that are better then themselues, though they see their right therein to bee neuer so cleare: as in these dayes of ours, the profaner sort doe euery whery almost, not seeke to share or part with the Ministerie, but to possesse themselues (in effect) of all their liuings. The effect that it tooke with <hi>Abraham,</hi> was somewhat, though not so much <note place="margin">Ibid. 11.</note>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="M"/> as God did require of him immediately after. Somewhat it was, because it was grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous vnto him on behalfe of his Sonne, to haue that required of him. And so many of the better sort of our Superiours, are loath to cast out those profane persons, that haue inuaded the maintenance of the Ministerie: though the Church it selfe, yea and the glory of God withall, doe neuer so iustly require the same. When God did require it, hee did adde comfort withall: and so are wee to note first in what sort hee did require it; then what was the comfort that hee gaue therewith. In that hee did require it, there be two things to be noted: one that it was the very same that <hi>Sara</hi> had required <note place="margin">Ibid. 12.</note> before (and for the matter wee spake of before, it is not vnlikely, but that our Superiors will finde, that what the Church requireth now as due vnto them, that also will GOD himselfe require then) to which end also it doth appertaine, that hee doth so precisely will him withall, to doe whatsoeuer she required, both as touching the Boy himselfe and his Mother; the other, the reason that hee giueth therewith, which was, that it was but <hi>Isaac</hi> onely, by whome that seede should bee deriued, on which God would bestow those speciall blessings that before hee spake of (and so may ours in like sort reason, that it is not that which is the needfull maintenance of the Ministery, but their other lands and goodes that God will blesse vnto them.) The comfort that hee gaue <note place="margin">Ibid. 13.</note> therewith, was, that hee would make the other a great people also, because he was his seede: and so may of ours hope, that if they be of the seede of <hi>Abraham,</hi> professors of the Gospell but after their manner, yet will God so blesse them also, in the things of this world, that they neede not to meddle with the Ministers portion, no more then <hi>Ismael</hi> because of that, should neede, to intercept any thing that belonged to <hi>Isaac.</hi> In <hi>Abrahams</hi> performance hereof, we are to note, first the substance of the thing it selfe: then, the manner of doing it. The substance of the thing it selfe was, that hee did it <note place="margin">Ibid. 14.</note> as it was required: and so should our superiours too, send away all our <hi>Ismaels,</hi> from the inheritance or portions of those our <hi>Isaaks.</hi> The manner of doing it resteth in two points: one, that he rose vp betime to doe it (and so should ours▪ euen the same mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, <note place="margin">Tremel.

                  </gap>n.</note> it seemeth, being that night admonished of it; the other, that hee gaue them so little with them for ought that wee read (though it be thought that all is not mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned) that it seemeth thereby he did not gratifie them (no more should ours) with any part of that which belonged vnto <hi>Isaac,</hi> though otherwise his affection was great <note place="margin">Gen. 17: 18. &amp; 21, 11.</note> to the one, and not vnlikely but to be somewhat to the other also, but yet did he giue them but bread and water, to enter them into their iourney, and so did leaue them to Gods prouidence. In the moderation wherewith it proceeded wee are to note, first that they were in hard estate for the time: then, that God did comfort them with bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter shortly after. Their hard estate for a time, was first in this their casting out: then, in some other things that immediately followed. Their casting out, was a woorse <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="N"/> matter, than, it may be themselues perceiued: so to be sundered from the peculiar peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, and from the blessings that to them were promised. Of those that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately <note place="margin">Ibid. 14. 15, 16.</note> followed, one was common to them both, which was their wandering in the wildernesse: others more propper to either of them, as the Boy ready to perish by thirst; and the Mothers sorrow thereon, getting her-selfe somewhat out of the way, that she might not see her Childs departure. But now when they were in this distresse, God came in with that his comfort vnto them: first deliuering them from their present distresse; then, comming forth with farther fauours. For their present distresse, first it <note place="margin">Ibid, 17, 18.</note> is noted, that the Lord heard the cry of the Childe, called to his Mother, badde her to be of good comfort, and to go take her Childe againe; and that hee would make a great Nation of him: then, that the Lord opened her eies, so that shee espied a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine <note place="margin">19.</note>
               <pb n="78" facs="tcp:7530:51"/> neare vnto her, whereby to relieue their present necessity (as we also see not our good, in things that are nearest vnto vs, vntill the Lord do vouchsafe to open our eies, that so wee may finde it.) Those farther fauours were, that the Lord was with the Childe after, so that he had presently a dwelling there in the wildernesse, grew to be va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant and ready of his hands, and by his Mothers procurement was married to an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptian <note place="margin">20, 21.</note> woman. Hee that still kept his fourmer estate with him, was <hi>Isaac</hi> his Sonne, of whome we haue no farther to consider here, but onely while his Father liued, during which time, the Story goeth but of his Father, and not vpon him. In whome we haue two speciall things to be considered: one, what crosses were in his way; the other how it pleased God to help him therein. The crosses he had, did some of them arise direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from others: and some of them arose, as it were, but onely of themselues. Those were, <hi>Ismael</hi> first, and <hi>Abraham</hi> after. <hi>Ismael,</hi> as we heard, did in such sort gibe at him <note place="margin">Gen. 21. 9.</note> euen in his Fathers house, &amp; without any cause giuen by him, that the Apostle calleth it persecution: and <hi>Abraham</hi> his owne Father who tenderly loued him, bound him and <note place="margin">Gal. 4. 29.</note> layed him on the Alter, and was ready to slay him vnto the Lord. To haue arisen of <note place="margin">Gen. 22. 9, 10.</note> themselues we may account these two: that <hi>Ismael</hi> his base Brother came vp so fast or <note place="margin">Ibid, 21, 20. 21 &amp; 25, 16, 18.</note> prospered so well, while he yet stucke still in his fourmer estate: and that hee hauing such an issue promised, his Father notwithstanding as it seemeth did not seeke to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide a Wife for him, till he was almost forty yeares old; and then had no Childe ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">Gen. 24. 4 &amp; 25, 20, 21, 26.</note> (his Wife being barren) till twenty yeares after. Howe it pleased God to help him therein, is to be seene in euery of them. For <hi>Ismael</hi> and his mother withall, were <note place="margin">Ge. 21, 12, 14</note> presently cast out thereupon: <hi>Abraham</hi> was stayed from doing any hurt vnto him; and besides had a blessing of great price giuen him, whereof <hi>Isaac</hi> also was to be partaker; <note place="margin">Ge, 22, 15-18.</note> and if it were long first, yet afterward hee shewed himselfe to be carefull of it, and to <note place="margin">Gen, 24, 1-9.</note> haue a speciall good regard vnto it: though <hi>Ismael</hi> in earthly things got vp very soon, yet were there better laid vp for <hi>Isaac:</hi> and albeit the <hi>Ismaelites</hi> did sooner encrease, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="O"/> yet multiplied the others shortly after exceedingly also, and without comparison were the more blessed people by farre. Concerning his death it is noted, first of what age he was when he died, namely one hundered threescore and fifteen yeares old; then <note place="margin">Gen. 25, 7. 10.</note> withall, that hee was not onely full of yeares, or as we say, of a great age, or that he had liued (in his owne contentment) euen to the full, but also had an hundered yeares in the seruice of God, to those that he had liued before (and hope that God will prolong euen our yeares too in his seruice, albeit we be old when we come vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it:) then, that <hi>Isaac</hi> and <hi>Ismael</hi> his Sonnes did both ioyne together in burying of him (as not onely the Children of God, but euen the Children of the World also, in such kinde of duties are oft-times forwarde enough) and that they buried him in that very place which to such purpose before hee had bought, and where himselfe had buried <hi>Sarah</hi> his wife.</p>
            <p n="8">8 Those that were farther off from him, and yet within the bounds of his Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> were most of them now liuing already: but some of them vnborne as yet. Those that were now liuing already, were, first two of the Neighbour<hi>-Princes,</hi> both in one case to speake of: then, two seuerall peoples of the same Land, in diuers cases. The two Neighbour <hi>Princes</hi> were, <hi>Pharaoh</hi> the King of <hi>Aegipt,</hi> for the one: and <hi>Abime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lek,</hi> the King of <hi>Gerar,</hi> for the other. That they were both in one case to speake of, I therefore account, because they both would haue taken away their soiourners wife, but that the Lord did stand fast with him against them both. Where first it shall be good to consider of such things as are common to them both: then, of such others as are more proper to either of them. Common to them both it was, that for her great beauty, first they were desirous to haue had her, and yet though they were <note place="margin">Ge. 12. 10-16. 8, 19, 10, 12. 45. Ge. 12, 19, 10, 20, 8-10, 14-16.</note> but <hi>Heathen</hi> men, not as his wife, but as they thought shee was but his Sister: then also, that being admonished thereof by the Lord, they restored his Wife vntouched to him againe. And so our great men in the world, are ready inough some-times to take women vnto them, not much regarding by what right they haue them, and therein to offend much farther, then either of these: and so like-wise much more bouldly to deale with Church-liuings, married (as it were) before, vnto the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:7530:51"/> whereunto they belonged; especially, when the Incombents themselues, for their owne safety, or to auoid some speciall danger, durst not claime their right vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them. Neither do they, when once they haue gotten them, so readily part with them againe, as in that case these two Kinges then did: notwithstanding, whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer reproofe they find, in the better sort of the learned now, and of the Fathers themselues of old; or in the holy Scriptures, which themselues will not deny to bee the vndoubted word of God. Proper vnto <hi>Pharaoh</hi> it is, that he entreated <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> well for her sake, and thereupon gaue him both Catle and seruants plentifully <note place="margin">Gen. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Proper vnto <hi>Abimelek</hi> it was, that he did it singlenesse of heart (as the Lord himselfe acknowledgeth) and yet that he is specially and straitly charged <note place="margin">Ge. 20, 4, 6-7.</note> vpon paine of death to himselfe and to all that he had, to deliuer to that straunger his Wife againe (specially noting that hee was a Prophet, and that hee should pray for him, insinuating withall, that he did stand in neede of it:) that when he deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red her he gaue them great guifts besides; and yet iust reproofe to them both (so <note place="margin">14, 15, 16.</note> would ours also be dealt with) for concealing their wedlocke: and that till this was done, the Lord had stroken them all with barrennesse, but then did cure that defect <note place="margin">17, 18.</note> vnto them. Those two seuerall peoples of the same Land were the <hi>Sodomites,</hi> and their neighbours-by, for the one: and the <hi>Hittites</hi> or the sonnes of <hi>Heth,</hi> for the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. As touching the <hi>Sodomites</hi> and their neighbours adjoining, there bee two principall thinges of them declared: first their chasticement; then their destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. In their chasticement, the cause of it seemeth first to be noted: then, the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticement it selfe. The cause of it is, as it seemeth, the same that goeth a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: namely, that the men of <hi>Sodom</hi> (and so belike the residue also, because they <note place="margin">Gen, 13: 13.</note> were both in their chasticement, and in their distruction, partakers with them) were wicked, and exceeding great sinners against the Lord. Their chasticement was, first that they were constrained to serue another Prince bordering on them (and they that cannot better vse their liberty, are worthy to be abridged of it) the space <note place="margin">Gen. 14▪ 4.</note> of twelue yeares: and that, when they endeuoured to deliuer themselues from that <note place="margin">Ibid 5-11.</note> yoke of bondage, they were then ouerthrowne in battle, and their Countrey cleane spoyled besides; sauing that <hi>Abraham,</hi> to recouer <hi>Lot</hi> his Nephew, did after ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take those that had done it, preuailed against them, and brought backe againe the <note place="margin">Ibid. 13. 16.</note> spoyle they had taken, In the story of their distruction we haue in like sort set down both the occasion of it, and the thing it selfe. The occasion of it is declared to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> by those three Angels whom he receiued: and it is (in effect) as the other; <note place="margin">Cen. 18, 16-21</note> namely, because they were so exceeding great sinners. But therein it shall be good to consider, both in what manner it was opened to <hi>Abraham:</hi> and what moderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is there declared to haue beene vsed therein. In the manner of the opening of it we are to note, both that God would not conceale it from <hi>Abraham:</hi> and what the reason was why he would not. That he would not conceale it from <hi>Abraham,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ibid. 17.</note> it is a reasonable good testimony vnto vs, that from those that are his indeede, hee will not conceale what hee is to do, of any of those thinges that any way concerne them or theirs. The reason why he would not conceale it from him, is partly giuen out of the fauour that <hi>Abraham</hi> was in with God: and partly out of the vse that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> would make thereof vnto others. In respect of that fauour that he was in <note place="margin">Ibid. 18.</note> with God, the cause is giuen, for that he should bee a great and a mighty people, in whom all the Nations of the earth were to bee blessed; and for that hee knew him, <note place="margin">Ibid. 19.</note> (which seemeth to be, for that <hi>Abraham</hi> did so often giue so good testemony of his faith and obedience towardes God, as that God which otherwise perfectly knoweth both the wayes and hearts of all, had neuerthelesse a more speciall knowledge of him) that he walked vprighly before him; a kind of knowledge that is to be wished,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:7530:52"/> God might haue of euery of those that more specially professe themselues to be his seruants. In respect of the vse that <hi>Abraham</hi> would make thereof vnto others, it <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> is saide likewise, that to that end hee imparted so much vnto him, that hee might charge his Children and Family after him to obserue or keepe the way of the Lord, by exercising themselues in iustice and iudgement, and that so the Lord might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme vnto him what he promised. In that part of the story which sheweth what moderation was vsed towardes them, wee are to note, first how it was debated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: then how it was performed after. In the debating of it before, we are in like sort, first to consider of the motion of <hi>Abraham</hi> on that behalfe: then, of the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere of God vnto him. In his motion on their behalfe wee may note, that purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to make some kind of intercession for them, and to that end drawing neerer vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord, he then did it, when two of them were gone about that businesse alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. So are we to consider, first of the circumstance of that time: then, how far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth <note place="margin">Ge. 18, 22, 23.</note> hee entreated for them. In the circumstance of that time we may note, that notwithstanding they were gone, and the Lord telling him before what their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose was, whereby hee might easily gather that now already they were gone about it: yet had he that good opinion of the equity and mercy of God, that euen yet he doubted not but that good might be done. Comming to consider how far-foorth he entreated for them, we are to note two thinges: first that he made no motion at all for his Nephew <hi>Lot;</hi> then neuerthelesse, that he had a speciall care for the better sort among them generally. In that he neuer made any motion for his Nephew <hi>Lot</hi> (whom notwithstanding he loued so dearely that a little before hee did for his sake hazzard the liues both of himselfe and of all his company, and therein aduanced <note place="margin">Ge. 14, 13-16.</note> himselfe mightily and strangely too, to an hard and venturous peece of seruice, as we saw before) we may take it as a good example to vs, how to forget all respect of flesh and bloud in the iudgements of God, &amp; in all such things besides as doe speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally concerne the glory of God: as the High Priest is afterward directed neuer to moorne for the death of his friendes whatsoeuer. Neither might <hi>Aaron</hi> the Father, nor <hi>Eleazar,</hi> nor <hi>Ithamar</hi> brethren moorn, for <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu</hi> so pitifully taken <note place="margin">Leuit. 10, 6.

That neuerthelesse hee had a speciall care for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> the better sort among them generally, it appeareth plainly in that he bent his speech to moue the Lord, first not destroy the good with the ill: then also, for a few good, altogether to spare many ill. If he should destroy the good with the ill, he doth in plaine tearmes shew, that he accounteth it such a thing, as he would neuer haue him <note place="margin">Gen. 18. 25.</note> to do: and that being the Iudge of the whole world, it were far vnseemely for him, and plainely that it were no vpright iudgement. That for some few good he would likewise haue the whole people to be spared, it appeareth most plainely, in that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning <note place="margin">Ibid. 23, 32.</note> but with fifty, hee neuerthelesse commeth (by degrees) at length to ten: earnestly mouing, that the whole company might be spared for them. In the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere of God vnto him we are to note, that he also saith nothing concerning <hi>Lot,</hi> though hee dealt notwithstanding very graciously with him: and so may wee hope, that God oft-times is mindfull of those that doe appertaine to any Seruaunt of his, though themselues do neuer desire to haue the course of Gods iudgements, for them intermitted. As touching the rest, he doth graciously yeeld to all his demaundes, <note place="margin">Ibid, 26-32.</note> shewing himselfe ready to spare them all, if there in those Citties he might find but fifty, fiue and fourty, fourty, thirty, twenty, yea or but ten iust persons among them all: and then, as hauing yeelded to whatsoeuer might in any reason bee requiered, and <hi>Abraham</hi> seeking no farther neither, hee departed from him; as also <hi>Abraham</hi> thereupon returned homeward againe. Out of which we may gather, that God is <note place="margin">Ibid, 33.</note> exceeding mercifull vnto vs, euen to the vttermost that our selues can thinke any reason to looke for at his handes (a great deale more also, though this example reach not so farre:) and that God vseth to spare many ill, for some very fewe good among them; so making the world (though themselues do not see it) very deepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly behoulding vnto those fewe Children of God that are among them. In the performance of their destruction, after that so farre it was debated before, wee are
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:7530:52"/> to note, first how themselues, by their owne exceeding great iniquity, did <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> themselues to be most worthy of it: then, how accordingly it fell vpon them. They declared themselues to be most worthy of it, by certaine foule iniquities of theirs, which brake forth of them on a present occasion that then they tooke. So wee are to consider, first what that occasion was: then how naughtily they dealt thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The occasion was, that those two Angels of the wrath of God that were sent to destroy it, taking vpon them the likenesse of men, trauailing from one place to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, and being earnestly inuited by <hi>Lot</hi> to take their entertainment of him, did in <note place="margin">Gen. 19, 1, 2, 3</note> the end yeeld vnto him, and so went in as to lodge, and soiourne for that night with him. A good patterne of hospitality in <hi>Lot:</hi> and how notably the same was now rewarded, in that hee so receiued Angels, when as hee thought they had beene but men. How naughtily they dealt thereupon my sufficiently appeare, both by the foulenesse of their sinne it selfe: and by their owne impenitencie therein. The sin it selfe was most odious especially in the very nature of it: but very much also in that it was offered to such as it was. The nature of it cannot but be exceeding euill, both <note place="margin">Ibid. 4. 5</note>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> because it was very beastly, carnally to know their owne sex, and because therein it was directly against nature it selfe. It was exceeding euill likewise, because it was offered both vnto strangers: and to such, as by one of their owne Citty now were taken to harbour. Their impenitency therein is wonderfull also, first in that which they did themselues: then, in that they would not bee said by others. That which they did themselues, was, that they came so many about it, euen the whole Citty to speake of: and nothing shamed, in so extreame beastlinesse, one of another; neyther the younger sort of them, nor yet the elder. Those others that would haue staied them were, first <hi>Lot</hi> himselfe: then, those guests of his, the Angels. <hi>Lot,</hi> to the end <note place="margin">Ibid. 6-8.</note> that he might stay them, to avoide one euill, doth of himselfe offer another: offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring vnto them his two Daughters, maidens as yet, to abuse at their pleasure, so that those his guests might be spared. In which we may note some thinges in him: and some others, in them likewise. In him wee may finde some thinges commendable: and some others, reprouable also. Commendable it was, that hee had so speciall a care to preserue his guests from such villaines: and that, notwithstanding they were now so very badly giuen (which also himselfe doth not winke at, nor bear with them in it) yet he doth terme them his bretheren, and doth gently entreat them. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proueable it was, that hee yeelded so far vnto them, that he allowed them a lesse sin, to stay them from a greater: and that therein he would haue yeelded his own daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters vnto their filthy lusts, whome by the nature of his charge, he aboue others ought to preserue. Whereby also it seemeth, that he had no remembrance of God, in that, in so great distresse as this, he sought not vnto him. In them may we note that they were maruelous wickedly set vpon their sin, when as neither the abuse of those yong women would content them: nor that pittifull and vnnaturall fight, to see the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther so ready to prostitute his Daughters vnto them, could make them giue backe from the wicked pupose they had in hand. Yet afterward the <hi>Israelites,</hi> enraged in <note place="margin">2 King. 3, 27:</note> their minds against the <hi>Moabites,</hi> and in the heate of battaile against them at that present, when they saw the King of <hi>Moab</hi> being then in desperate case, and very sore distressed by them, to sacrifice his owne sonne that should haue raigned after him, to obtaine in that distresse some helpe of his Goddes, so abhorred the fact that they presently left him, and went their waies. But these are so farre from relenting, that <note place="margin">Gen. 19. 9.</note> they bid him stand backe; vpbraid him that he was but a stranger; charge him that now at his pleasure hee would ouer-rule them; threaten to deale worse with him then with those others; and accordingly make towards him inforcible manner, euen to breake open the dore vpon him. The Angels therefore now beginning to take the matter in hand, first take-in <hi>Lot,</hi> and shut-too the doore against the rest: and <note place="margin">Ibid. 10, 11.</note> then stroke that whole company with amazednesse of heart, and blindnesse of sight, that they could in no wise finde the doore, and in the ende were weary of seeking it. So they shewed thēselues very plainly, that they were most worthy of the wrath that was cast vpon them: &amp; how accordingly it fel vpon them is now to be seene. Where first we are to note one speciall manner that God vseth: neuer to be so grieued with
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:7530:53"/> the wicked, but that still he retaineth his fauour to those that are his. Heere there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore may we see, that the safety of those whom he will preserue is first regarded: and then, are those ouer-whelmed with wrath, whom he meant for their sinnes to destroy. So are wee first to consider of those whom it pleased him to vouchsafe such fauour: then of those that had no such fauour offered vnto them. Concerning those to whom he vouchsafed to offer such fauour, wee are first to see, who they were: then, in what sort they were dealt withall. In searching out who they were, wee are to note, that such fauour was offered to moe, then afterwarde enioyed the benefite of it. So that some there were that did enioy it: and others, that did not. Those that did fully enioy it, were three persons onely, and those of <hi>Sodome:</hi> whereas, <note place="margin">Gen. 19. 25. Deut. 29, 23.</note> not onely it, but <hi>Gomorrah</hi> also, <hi>Admah,</hi> and <hi>Zeboim,</hi> three other Citties, were all destroyed at this time also. And those three persons were none other, but onely <hi>Lot,</hi> and his two Daughters: whom the Story will afterward shew, not to haue beene so very good, but that we may see, that it was to be imputed onely to the fauour of God, and nothing at all to their goodnesse, that they were not with the rest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed. To finde in what sort they were preserued, wee are to note, that the dangers were two: and as the dangers themselues were diuers; so were they diuersly preserued also. Their former danger was in <hi>Sodome,</hi> where then hee dwelt: which that they <note place="margin">Gen. 19, 12▪ 13 15.</note> might escape, the Angels did now plainely tell him, that they would destroy that Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, for the great iniquity that was therein, and that the Lord had sent them to doe it: and thereupon willed him, out of hand, if he had any there whom he would bee loath to haue destroyed, to get them away; and themselues also to hasten away so fast as they could. And when <hi>Lot</hi> made not such hast as the danger that he was in did then <note place="margin">Ibid. 16, 17.</note> require, then those Angels tooke him, his Wife, and his Daughters, by the handes, and led them forth, and bad them fly for their liues, and neither to looke backe, nor to stay in all that plaine Countrey, but to speede them soone to an Hill that they shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, that they might bee safe there. Their latter danger was such, as now, by that commaundement of the Angels, <hi>Lot</hi> himselfe did feare to be towardes them: name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that if he might not be safe but till he came thither, or (as others take it) but there; hee doubted it was more then they could reach in time; or else, that some ill might light on him there. Heereupon he besought the Aungels (but gathering his speach <note place="margin">Ibid. 18. 20.</note> then, as onely to one) that as he had found exceeding great fauour in his eyes, so to preserue his life from that common destruction of the rest: so it would please him now in that fauour of his, to spare him his flight vnto that Mountaine, least they not beeing able in time to reach it, might so be ouertaken with that destruction with the others; but rather that hee would giue them leaue to fly to a Citty that was there, but a little from them, pleading that it was but a smal matter to grant them so much, or as others take it, that the Citty it selfe was but small. Whereunto the Angell answered, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/>
               <note place="margin">Ibid. 21, 22.</note> he had now yeelded to gratify him in that point also; and for his sake would spare that Cittie, and therefore bad him to make hast thither; telling him withall, that hee could doe nothing till hee were there. Whereuppon, in processe of time after, the Citty it selfe was in their tongue, called <hi>Small</hi> or <hi>Little;</hi> that beeing the meaning of <hi>Zoar,</hi> whereby it was called. Those that did not enioy it, though it had beene offered vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, were some as yet remaining in <hi>Sodome:</hi> and one, of this company that the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels had thus brought foorth. Those that yet remained in <hi>Sodome,</hi> were those twoe Men that should haue married those Daughters of <hi>Lot:</hi> who, when their Father in <note place="margin">Ibid. 4.</note> Law that should haue beene, tolde them that the Lorde would presently destroy that Citty, and therefore willed them foorth-with to get them out of it, made light of it, as though he had but iested with them. As many of vs likewise, do oft-times make but small reckoning of such iudgementes as the Seruantes of God haue espyed, and tell vs to bee hanging ouer our heades. That one of this company whom the Angels themselues had brought forth, and yet miscarried, was the principall person but one, euen the Wife of <hi>Lot</hi> himselfe: who, contrary to that they were bid, looking backe, <note place="margin">Ibid, 16,</note> was thereupon turned into a Piller of Salt; by that iudgement of hers to season others, who by so faire a warning as it, would not take any season her selfe. Those others that had no such fauour offered vnto them, were all the other Inhabitantes of those foure <note place="margin">Ibid, 23, 25.</note>
               <pb n="83" facs="tcp:7530:53"/> Citties, of whom it is sayde, first that <hi>Lot</hi> and his company getting to <hi>Zoar,</hi> by that time the Sunne hegan to get vp, and so beeing out of danger now, then presently the Lord cast downe Fire and Brimstone on those Citties, and vtterly destroyed them withall the Inhabitants of them, &amp; whatsoeuer grew on the ground besides: then <note place="margin">Ibid. 27, 29.</note> also, that <hi>Abraham</hi> getting vp betimes in the morning, and comming to the place where he had stood before the Lord, and entreated for them, and now looking to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes those Citties, and the Countrie about them, himselfe was in some part an Eye-witnesse of that their destruction, seeing the smoake of that fire, arising as the smoake of a Furnace; but yet that God, when he ouerthrew those Citties wherein <hi>Lot</hi> dwelt, did remember <hi>Abraham,</hi> and for his sake, sent <hi>Lot</hi> away safe, hauing before made promise vnto him, among other things, that he would blesse those that blessed him, among whom <hi>Lot</hi> wee may easily conceiue was one, beeing so neere him, and otherwise so much beholding vnto him as many waies wee knowe that he was. As touching the <hi>Hittites</hi> or Sonnes of <hi>Heth,</hi> wee haue in them a good example of humanity to strangers: wherein we are in like sort to see, vpon what oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion the same did arise; and in what manner it was performed. The occasion consisted of two principall branches: one, the death of <hi>Sarah, Abrahams</hi> Wife; the other, that <hi>Abraham</hi> thereupon made motion vnto them, to haue a burying place <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> among them. As touching the death of <hi>Sarah,</hi> it is declared, of what age she was <note place="margin">Gen, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>3, 1, 2.</note> when shee dyed, namely, 1 27. yeares olde: and where it was that it pleased God to take her hence, namely, in <hi>Hebron,</hi> or the Territories of it, an ancient Citty in the Land of <hi>Canaan.</hi> As touching the motion that <hi>Abraham</hi> thereupon made vnto them, to haue a burying place among them, we haue noted vnto vs, at what time he <note place="margin">Ibid. 2, 3.</note> did it: and in what manner hee did. For the time, it was not (as sometimes with vs in our idlenesse and vanity, omitting such needefull businesse as then wee should do, and occupying our selues before we need in such matters) vntill the time that she was already departed this life: nor, vntill hee had done that duty of mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning for her. The manner of it was, first as touching some place or other general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: <note place="margin">Ibid. 4.</note> and, when he found them so willing, as to giue him choice where himselfe would be, then for one place more specially. In his motion for some place among thē gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, he first graunteth, that himselfe is but a stranger, and soiourner among them: and therefore woulde desire no more but to haue some burying place, proper to him and his among them; yet, that so much hee would gladly haue. Wherein there is no question, but that hee had no superstition at all in buriall: but that because himselfe was priuy, that God had promised that Land to him and his, this was a fruit of the Faith that he had in that promise of God: thus before hand taking, so far as hee could, possession thereof, not by the those dead bones of hers, but by that liuing <note place="margin">Ibid. 5. 9.</note> Faith of his. When hee saw them so well inclined vnto that motion of his, that they gaue him free choise among them, then he directed his speach for one place more spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, and named that speciall place vnto them, desiring them that they would bee meanes for him vnto the owner thereof, that for his money and full woorth of it, hee <note place="margin">Ibid. 10. 13.</note> might haue it of him: and, when that also was presently offered vnto him of free gift, by the owner himselfe then present; yet, doing obeysance for their great curtesie, hee still persisted, not to haue it but for his money. The perfourmance of it was a great part of it in their readinesse before: then, in the finall and actuall agreement of both <note place="margin">Ibid. 5, 6, 11. 14, 15.</note> parts after. Their readinesse before, both to the first motion generally, and to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which was more speciall, both in the whole company of them, and in <hi>Ephron</hi> the owner of that peece of ground that hee most desired, was both an example of good humanity vnto straungers: and a good patterne withall, of what dignity the seruants of God may bee, euen among the strangers of this World, if they can rightly carry <note place="margin">Ibid. 16-20.</note> themselues among them as they ought to doe. In the finall and actuall agreement of both parts after, the one party did set a price thereon, and parted with it; the other gaue the price that was set, and accepted of it: and both these in the presence and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

            <p n="9">9 <hi>Abraham,</hi> now being already departed as we saw before, and such other things <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> being remembred as to his Story did appertaine, both of those that were nearer vnto him, and of others farther off from him, now are wee to come to <hi>Isaac</hi> his Sonne, and to see the Story of his time also. Concerning which wee are to note, that of him there is nothing so much set downe, as either of <hi>Abraham</hi> his Father before, or of <hi>Iacob</hi> his Son after: and that the compasse of his time is much furnished with relation of others, partly with some mention of <hi>Ismael</hi> his halfe-brother, and of <hi>Esau</hi> his elder Sonne; but especially with <hi>Iacob</hi> the younger. So are we first to consider what we haue set down of himselfe: then, what we haue (in the compasse of time) set downe of those others. That which is set downe of himselfe is most appertaining to his life: but some part ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaining to his death too. That which is appertaining to his life is some part of it, as it were but generall: and some part of it, more speciall. That which wee may account to be generall, is, that which concerneth his whole estate, not respecting one thing or other specially, but onely the whole: as namely, when it is said, that after the death of <hi>Abraham,</hi> God did blesse <hi>Isaac</hi> his Sonne. Which is not meant of any one blessing in particular, but that as God was with his Father before, and in all thinges prospered his <note place="margin">Gen. 25, 11.</note> affaires and waies among the people, with whome he soiourned: so was hee now with <hi>Isaac</hi> his Sonne, euen as hee was with his Father before. As also it doeth a while af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, more plainely appeare, when <hi>Abimelek</hi> King of <hi>Gerar,</hi> fearing his might because hee saw him to encrease so much as he did, had charged him to depart out of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey. <note place="margin">Ibid,: 6. 16,</note> For then, not onely God himselfe did bid him notwithstanding to be of good cheere, and told him that hee was the God of his Father <hi>Abraham,</hi> and nowe would <note place="margin">Ibid. 24.</note> be with him also, and blessed him: but euen <hi>Abimelek</hi> himselfe likewise, together with one of his speciall friends, and the Captaine of his Army, came and desired to haue a <note place="margin">Ibid. 26-28.</note> league with him, euen onely because they did so plainely see, that the Lord was with him. That which is more speciall, is most appertaining to such time of his as where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in hee made no preparation yet for his death: but partly also vnto such time, as when himselfe doubted that hee had not long to liue, and was therefore desirous, for one thing specially, to take some order before. That which belongeth to the former of these, resteth in two principall branches: one concerning his marriage; the other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his owne habitation. Concerning his marriage, first the time onely is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: then, some other things of greater moment. For the time it is said, that he was <note place="margin">Ibid, 25. 16. 20. 26.</note> full forty yeares old when as he was married to <hi>Rebecca;</hi> then, that it was twenty yerees more, before hee had any Childe by her also: a speciall good example to teach all men with much patience to await the performances of Gods promises towards vs, when as notwithstanding those great promises before, concerning a great posterity to be from his Father and him deriued; yet, as his Father had not him till fiue and twenty yeares after, so hee also was now threescore yeares olde before hee had any. Those other things of greater moment, are some concerning himselfe; and some others concerning <hi>Rebecca</hi> his Wife. Such as concern himselfe were these two: one that hee humbly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sought <note place="margin">Ibid. 21.</note>
               <pb n="85" facs="tcp:7530:54"/> the Lord on the behalfe of his Wife because she was barren (a good patterne <note place="margin">Ibid. 21.</note> for vs also, in all our necessities to seeke vnto God;) the other, that the Lord was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated of him, so that his Wife soone after conceaued, and was with Child by him. As wee in like manner need not to doubt, but that God will heare vs likewise, in such things as are needfull for vs, if wee shall truely seeke vnto him. Such as concerne <hi>Rebecca</hi> his Wife, are those things that did befall her, both while she was wlth child with those twins with whome she then went: and when shee was deliuered of them. While shee was with Child with them, shee sensibly perceiued, that the Childeren stroue together in her wombe. Whereupon being troubled, and somewhat dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayed <note place="margin">Ibid. 22.</note> at the straungenesse of it, shee enquired of the Lord what the matter meant (a good example for Women in all cases of Child-birth, and for vs all besides to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, in all our troublesome thoughts likewise, and whatsoeuer other necessities at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny time wee haue:) and the Lord then told her, that there were two speciall peoples <note place="margin">Ibid. 23.</note> in her wombe (and so euer in the Church here) as a reason sufficient, that it was no great maruaile if they did not better agree; and that the most vsuall or ordinarie course should so farre giue place in them, that the younger should grow the mightier, and the more woorthy, and that the elder should accordingly bee in subiection vnto him. A comfortable patterne to those that are the more dispised sort in the world here, if they do soundly cleaue vnto the Lord: that though the world maligne them and can neuer let them be quiet by them; yet are they the better with God, and so shall be acknowledged too, when the time by him appointed shall come. When the time was come, that shee was to be deliuered of them, the former of them came forth ruddish and hayrie: and therefore, seeing that being so hairie nowe, euen at his birth, hee attained to that which other Childeren commonly haue not till they be of <note place="margin">Ibid. 24, 25.</note> some growth, nor then neither but in much scanter manner, therefore they called his name <hi>Hesau,</hi> as already come to perfection.

Iun.</note> to hold by the heele. Concerning his owne habitation or being, we are first to <note place="margin">Ibid. 26.</note> consider where it was: then, what was the manner of it. As touching the former, wee are to note, that hetherto hauing remained in this Land where <hi>Abraham</hi> left him, and which was promised, in time to be theirs, now by occasion he left the same, and went vnto <hi>Gerar</hi> a Citty of the <hi>Philistims,</hi> and was of purpose (as it seemeth) to <note place="margin">Gen. 26: 1-6.</note> haue gon thence vnto <hi>Aegypt,</hi> as <hi>Abraham</hi> his Father on the like occasion had done before. The occasion of which his remoouing was a Famine, that now in his time also (as in <hi>Abrahams</hi> before) fell on that land wherein hee soiourned: for auoyding of which, being of purpose to go into <hi>Aegypt,</hi> but admonished by the Lord that hee should not so doo, hee went but onely to <hi>Abimelek</hi> King of <hi>Gerar</hi> and soiourned there. A sufficient example, both that God doth sometimes proue his dearest Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren with such necessities: and yet that themselues may not shrincke from them nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But being there, hee was not able thereto continue, but after a time was fain to returne into the maine Land againe, the <hi>Philistims</hi> hauing but an out-side of it. So are wee more specially to note, what was the Story of his being there: then, what followed when he came thence. Being there it is very plaine, that God did exercise him diuersly: but yet therin also did shew himselfe very gracious vnto him. The exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise was, partly by his owne infirmitie: and partly, by the enuy of others. Of his owne infirmity it was (and the same very great) that hee also now denied his Wife, as his Father had done before, first in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> then here also. But this was great infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity in him, not onely because that hee might well haue beene warned by that infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity <note place="margin">Ge. 12: 12. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

And if such infirmity were found in so great <note place="margin">Gen. 26, 3, 4.</note> Fathers as those, and in such matters withall: wee are the lesse to bee discouraged, if the like nowe and then fall out in vs. Of the enuy of others it was, that when they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> saw him so mightily to encrease, they then quarrelled with him about trifles, and <note place="margin">Ibi. 12-17. 20 <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="86" facs="tcp:7530:55"/> appeare: first in that time of that his infirmitie; then, in the time of that their enuy. In the time of that his infirmity, hee did not onely preserue his Wiues chastity in the <note place="margin">Ibid. 8-11.</note> meane season; and otherwise brought forth the trueth of the matter (which himselfe concealed so much as hee could:) but also put such a feare into their hearts, of some speciall vengeance to be cast vpon them, if any of them had done that villanie vnto her, as that straight order was presently taken, that they should be safe from all such daunger. In the time of that their enuy, God did not onely preserue him safe, that they did him no hurt to speake of, but onely some little trifling displeasures: but did specially blesse him besides. Those trifling displeasures wherewith he suffered him to bee exercised by them (while otherwise hee preserued him from all speciall hurt) were of two sorts: one, by the King himselfe, or by them all generally: the other by particuler persons onely, and those inferiours. By the King himselfe, or by them all generally, hee was commaunded to depart thence: and the reason is giuen, for that <note place="margin">Ibid. 16.</note> hee was growne much stronger than they. By particular persons, and those but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriours, there were two pelting displeasures offered vnto him: one, that they filled vp with earth those old Welles or watering-places, which the seruants of <hi>Abraham</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ibid. 15.</note> his Father had in <hi>Abrahams</hi> time digged before; the other, that the Sheepheards or Heards-men of <hi>Abimelek</hi> stroue with his seruants twice about others, newly digged <note place="margin">Ibid. 19-21.</note> by him, challenging those to be theirs likewise. That speciall blessing that God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides bestowed on him, was either concerning his own substance: or else concerning those hard neighbours of his. Concerning his substance, it is plainely noted, both <note place="margin">Ibid. 12-14.</note> that sowing in those parts, hee reaped an hundred fould encrease, and so did maruai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously encrease: and that in his greater and smaller Cattle, and in his owne family be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, hee was now growne exceeding great. Concerning those hard neighbours of his, first God himselfe did then againe appeare vnto him, and bad him be of good <note place="margin">Ibid. 24, 25.</note> comfort, assuring him, that for <hi>Abraham</hi> his Fathers sake hee would haue a speciall care of him, and in all his distresse euer be with him; and this so comfortably, that <hi>Isaac</hi> himselfe being well encouraged thereby now, there builded an Altar and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped: then also, hee put that feare of him into the heartes of <hi>Abimelek</hi> and some <note place="margin">Ibid. 26-31.</note> others of the chiefe about him, that they came soone after vnto him, and sought to haue league of amitie with him, which also hee did not onely confirme vnto them; but hauing before set his seruants to assay if they could not light on som spring there, and they nowe bringing him word, that they had light on a good fresh spring, hee thereupon, by the oath of amity or good neighbor-hood, which at that time passed <note place="margin">Ibid. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> desirous for one thing especially, to take some good order before hee departed, hee called his elder Sonne vnto him, and told him, that now being old and not kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing the time when God would call him, hee was now purposed, while yet he liued, <note place="margin">Gen, 17-3-6.</note> and was of good sense and perfect memorie, to leaue a speciall blessing vnto him. So hee bad him take his Bow and Quiuer, and goe and kill him a peece of flesh, that hee might haue such meate as was to his appetite, &amp; so would he bestow that blessing on him. <hi>Esau</hi> did as his Father bad him: but by the pollicy of his Mother, both his <note place="margin">Ibid, 7-31.</note> Father was beguiled, and himselfe preuented therein by his Brother. Whereby it may seeme▪ that God was therein disposed to haue a speciall preseruatiue for the people of <hi>Israel</hi> that were out of <hi>Iacob</hi> to be raised, against the pride that otherwise might arise in their hearts, in respect of the prerogatiue that they should haue, not onely aboue those that came of <hi>Esau,</hi> but aboue all others besides.

For heere it is said, that he had twelue Sonnes (who also are by name recited) that they became Princes of their owne peoples, and had a large <note place="margin">Gen. 25, 12, 18</note> part of those Countries to dwell in: which albeit <hi>Adrichomius</hi> doth as it were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine <note place="margin">

In his life also, being 137. yeares, there is a good probable token of some speciall fauour of God towards him. Of <hi>Esau</hi> we haue some-what more then so. But as the Apostle did afterwarde account him a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane or godlesse person; so haue wee nothing of him (to speake of) but that <note place="margin">Heb. 12, 16.</note> which doth much tend thereunto: and yet notwithstanding, both that <hi>Iacob</hi> his Father did affect him more then the other; and that God did vouchsafe to giue him a speciall blessing besides. That we haue nothing of him to speake of, but such as are probable arguments that he was prophane indeed, may indifferent plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, first in the whol course of his life: then, in certain particular actions of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> The course of his life seemeth to be, that he gaue himselfe to Hunting, being, <note place="margin">Gen. 25. 27.</note> as he was, so skilfull therein: a great wasting of precious time, which vnder so god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a <hi>Patriarke</hi> as his Father was, no doubt might haue beene much better spent. Those his particular actions besides, that boad such a matter, are of two sorts: some that argue a small care that hee had, in certaine matters of weight that did much concerne him; others, that hee had but small feeling of his owne sinne neyther. Of the former sort there were two: one that so easily, or fondly rather, he parted with his birth-right; the other, that hee did in such sort marry. As touching his Birth-right, his Brother did no sooner moue him in it, but he was as ready to yeeld <note place="margin">Ibid. 29-34.</note> it vnto him: and though he was at that time hungry, yet, besides that it came vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him for lacke of better gouernment; both hee might otherwise haue supplyed his want therein, and hee might well haue conceiued, that his Brother would not haue failed him in that point neyther, though he for that matter had stoode to his owne. In his marriage hee did not onely match himselfe with a couple at once, and afterwardes tooke him a third besides: but also made his choyce of such, as, <note place="margin">Ibid. 26, 1, 2. 28, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>-9.</note> for the better of them, hee had little comfort in the promise of God, being as she was, of <hi>Ismaels</hi> race; and for the others, being of the inhabitants of that Land, nothing at all, but discomforture onely, because they were an accursed people, <note place="margin">Gen. 9, 25, 10, 15. Ex. 23, 23, 27</note> should be in seruile estate vnto others, and were in the end to be destroyed. That wherein he seemeth himselfe to haue little feeling of his sinne, was extreame ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred to his Brother, for preuenting him of the blessing, purposing with himselfe to <note place="margin">Gen, 27, 43.</note> kill him for the same. For himselfe parting with his Birth-right before, and by likelihood vnderstanding since, that the blessing was to go to his Brother also: as in the latter of them he was to rest in Gods ordinance, and to hold himselfe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented therewith, though himselfe had deserued none other; so in the former hee might plainely see, that by his owne folly before, he had iustly deserued now to be excluded. Yet hee considereth not his owne sinne: but boileth in wrath against his Brother: That his Father did affect him more then he did the other, is plainely set downe: and lesse maruell should it bee vnto vs, if good men sometimes doe <note place="margin">Gen. 25. 28.</note> beare a naturall affection more vnto such, as in whom they see no great matter to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes God; then to such as themselues do know to be much the likelier, to be of farre greater price with him. That God did vouchsafe him a speciall blessing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, it is plaine likewise, both for that hee grew so fast to so great a people, that soone after they became a Kingdome: and had eight Kinges one after another (but <note place="margin">Ge. 36. 1-4<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

The occasion of it, was first of all the hatred of <hi>Esau</hi> his Brother: but then also, a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall regard of his owne bestowing in marriage. The hatred of his saide Brother was such towardes him, as that <hi>Rebecca</hi> his Mother feared he should haue beene slaine if there be had staied. Whereupon seeking in time to preuent it, shee first laboured to get her Sonne in mind to withdraw himselfe out of the way for a time: and then, to perswade her husband also, himselfe to send him forth likewise.

But then, comming to her husband, we do not find that she spake any thing to him of that matter (and then haue wee therein, a patterne in her, of a speciall good moderation of her affections: and so consequently, both a proofe of her wisedome; and a care that she had not to cast her Son <hi>Esau</hi> cleane out of fauour:) but onely vttered what regard she had, to haue <hi>Iacob</hi> matched in marriage, better then was <hi>Esau</hi> before. Therefore concerning that regard that they both had to bestow him better in marriage, as she did take this opportunity to moue him in it, and he did readily yeelde vnto it: so it is good to marke withall, how ready a way there was before laid forth vnto both. For we read before, that those two Wiues of <hi>Esau</hi> which he had taken of the women of that Countrey-breede, were a great <note place="margin">Ibid. 1. 2.</note> heart-breake vnto them both: and therefore lesse maruell, and no new thing nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that now she plainely tould her husband, that shee for her part could haue no ioy to liue, if <hi>Iacob</hi> were in such sort matched; nor that <hi>Isaac</hi> did thereupon so rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily <note place="margin">Ibid. 48.</note> call him, and, without any longer drift of the matter, sent him away. So by this occasion <hi>Isaac</hi> calling for him, and now of his owne voluntary and free con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, <note place="margin">Gen▪ 28, 1-5.</note> confirming vnto him those blessings, which before, being himselfe beguiled he bestowed indeede vpon him, but thought that he had bestowed them on his el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der sonne <hi>Esau,</hi> and charging him not to match himselfe with any of the <hi>Canaa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites;</hi> but to go to his Vnckle <hi>Laban,</hi> and there to marry some Daughter of his, besought the Almighty God to blesse him, that hee might encrease and grow to a mighty people, and inherit the Land, that God before had promised to giue vnto <hi>Abraham</hi> and to his seed, wherein he had beene but a soiourner yet. In the story of this his iourney we finde, that for a time he was (in comparision) but in bare or meane estate: but afterward that he was greatly encreased. He was (in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parision) but in bare or meane estate, both at his going thither: and for most of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> his time there. As touching his going thither, although himselfe were then in meane estate: yet is it very apparent withall, that God was then also very gracious vnto him. That himselfe was then in meane estate, may sufficiently appeare in this, that whereas we haue no mention of him at all, but onely at his setting forth, and in two places besides as he was on his way, in none of those haue we any men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of others with him, much lesse of any attendance: &amp; himselfe doth afterwarde <note place="margin">Ibid. 10, 11, 29, 1, 2.</note> confesse, to the glory of God for his great encrease then, that at this time that now we speake of, he passed ouer <hi>Iordan</hi> but onely with his staffe, as scant a furniture as any way lightly can by conceiued.

It may seeme strange vnto vs, that he was sent forth so barely, both in respect of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon vsage of all (to speake of) in all such cases: and in respect of some thinges
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:7530:56"/> also that did concerne that case of his more specially.

The things that more specially concerned that case of his, were of two sorts: one, time past; others of the time then present.

               </gap>re his Father went about that businesse) hee sent the chiefe Steward of his house about it▪ who also had with him ten Camels, and other attendance of men besides: and went so prouided, that he gaue Iewels and rewardes very liberally as occasion was offered. Those that were of the time then present, were two: the one, how conuenient (if not cleerely needfull) it might seeme for <hi>Iacob</hi> now, to haue beene sent foorth with much better regard then so; the other, how able <hi>Isaac</hi> was, so to haue done. How conuenient it might seeme, that <hi>Iacob</hi> had beene sent forth with much grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter regard then so, ariseth out of two principall considerations: one, that now it appeared that God had made choice of him, on whom to bestow that speciall bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing: the other, the danger that he might be in by the wrath of his Brother. See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that God had now made it knowne, that hee had made choice of him for that speciall blessing, hee was accordingly to bee regarded: though not for outward pompes sake; yet so farre as was requisite, that his parents might therein shewe, that they also reuerenced that councell of God resting on him. Seeing also that he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> was in some danger, or at least might bee, by the wrath of his Brother, though it may be that other-waies they prouided for it: yet that also might in such a case, in good respect, iustly require a better attendance, at the least for that first part of his way, if not that necessity did so require, yet for the outward conueniēcy of it to such as knew not how the danger was otherwise preuented, or might be intended not to know it. How able <hi>Isaac</hi> was, so to haue done, besides that, there may be no questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it with any, for that he is so generally known to all to haue bin mightie and rich, the consideration of two onely thinges, may bee sufficient to cleere it to all: one, the reckoning that <hi>Abimelek</hi> made of him; the other, the time when this was done. The reckoning that <hi>Abimelek</hi> made of him, was in plaine tearmes, that he was then growne a great deale mightier then he; and thereupon, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing <note place="margin">Ge. 26. 16-28.</note> the discurtesitie that then hee did him, soone after hee sought to haue a league of amity with him: and yet was <hi>Abimelek</hi> himselfe a King. It was at such time as <hi>Isaac</hi> was so old, that now he thought he had not long to liue, and as it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, about an hundred seauen and twenty yeares old: in all which time, hauing <note place="margin">Ibid. 25: 5.</note> all his Fathers substance before, and the blessing of God so resting vppon him, as afterward it did, it could not (lightly) be, but that in substance or goods, hee farre exceeded <hi>Abraham</hi> his Father. All this notwithstanding, <hi>Iacob</hi> is sent forth from home as bare as may be, or, as we say, like No-body else. What our selues may gather of it, is now to be seene: and first, if it did arise from beneath; and then, if it did come downe from aboue. If it did arise from beneath, it may seeme to come, eyther of the simplicity of those dayes: or else of some set purpose. If of simplicitie of those daies, not regarding thinges of that kind, in such sort as the manner of the world now is: then, haue wee in that example a great reproofe to many of our doings now, when as simple and meane men to speake of in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison of <hi>Isaac,</hi> must haue such attendance on their Children, and must haue them so set forth to the eye of the World; and not onely in so weightie businesse as was this, but in euery trifling occasion whatsoeuer.

For albeit God had indeede determined on that which they sought for: yet, both they when they had better meanes, did seeke to atchieue it inordinately; and God himselfe could otherwise haue brought it to passe, and nothing needed that inordinate course of theirs. If in such displeasure he now sent him away so bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and yet not altogether in the way of reuenge, to that inordinate dealing of theirs, but in some part of iust punnishment of it: as it were no more, then they both deserued, so may we gather, that in all such inordinate dealing of ours, wee may well expect a seourge, euen of the best men that are, and most ready to yeeld to Gods holy ordinance when once they know it (as we see that hee then did, for that he would in no wise varry) and though the ordinance of God himselfe were <note place="margin">Gen 27. 35, 37 39.</note> for the thing that so we sought, but inordinatelie. If it did come downe from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue, that might it doe, either by some good minde in the parties: or else, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly from God himselfe. The good mind that I conceiue might bee in the parties, was, if so they rested on the prouidence of God, that eyther <hi>Isaac</hi> and <hi>Rebecca</hi> did thereupon in such sort send him away; or <hi>Iacob</hi> himselfe did thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on take that course that he did: which if they did, whethersoeuer of them it was that should doe it, there is no question, but that very commendably they might so doe. And as therein they did notably humble themselues: so were they thereby as much exalted afterward for it. If it came immediately from God himselfe, therein also haue we a notable Document, not to be grieued when God doth offer to abase vs, when as we may see, that in his secret purpose (as the euent doth shew, when it commeth) there is so notable exaltation to ensue therupon. That God was now also very gracious vnto him, he gaue sufficient proofe thereof, both neere vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the beginning of this his iourney: and neere vnto the ende of it againe. Neere to the beginning of it, it was, that God appeared vnto him at <hi>Bethel,</hi> where the first night hee tooke vppe his lodging. At which time, <hi>Iacob</hi> was faine to take vp his lodging in the fieldes (not being able to reach the Cittie which was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <note place="margin">Ge. 28. 10-15.</note> him) and when he was faine to make the hard stones (laid to such purpose, or couched together, so well as he could) to be his bolster or stay for his head, and in <note place="margin">Gen. 35. 3.</note> that his distresse called on God, as it seemeth, by that which followed. God there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vppon, euen that very night in so comfortable manner appeared vnto him, as that thereby both in visible demonstration, and in plaine tearmes besides, he gaue him to vnderstand, that not onely for that iourney he would be with him, both go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and comming, and bring him safe to his iournyes ende, and home againe: but <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="L"/> also would giue him that land where then hee lodged, make his seede to breake forth to the East, West, North, and South; and that in it all the Kindreds of the Earth should be blessed. Which also was so comfortably done, and so farre affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted <hi>Iacob</hi> himselfe, that not onely he acknowledged that there was in that place a <note place="margin">Ibid. 14-22▪</note> more speciall presence of God then he was aware of; and thereupon tearmed it the house of the Mighty God, and the Gate of Heauen: but also euen then presentlie raised vp a memoriall of it, of the stones whereon hee had rested, and after a sort consecrated them thereunto; and bound himselfe likewise in respect of those great promises of God to him then made, that the Lorde in the meane season giuing him what to eate, and wherewithall to be cloathed, bringing him home in peace to his Fathers, then he should bee his GOD, and that place should then bee vnto him
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:7530:57"/> the house of God, or that he would worship there, and that he would truely giue him a Tith of all he should bestow vpon him. In which it shall not be amisse, more specially to note some-thing as touching that apparition of God vnto him: and then, how himselfe was affected at it. As touching that apparition of God vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, by a ladder that from the earth reached vppe vnto heauen, by which the Angels of GOD went vp and downe; as in particular it might assure <hi>Iacob</hi> for that his iourney, GOD giuing his Angels charge of him, both as hee went for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde, and as hee should returne againe: so in generall it may bee very well a figure of Christ, GOD, and Man, coupling Heauen and Earth together, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciling God and Man: by whom also the graces of God descend vnto vs, and by whom onely our Thankesgiuinges and Prayers, and our whole seruice of him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, doe from hence get vp vnto him. Neither did those present fauours, nor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises of good thinges to come, any other way descend vnto <hi>Iacob</hi> at a present, but only by Christ, ordained then in the secret purposes of God, though he came not till long after, in the Flesh: as also God himselfe doth afterward direct vs, by him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riue whatsoeuer fauours they are he bestoweth vpon vs. As touching <hi>Iacob,</hi> how <note place="margin">Esay 7. 10-15.</note> hee was affected at it, it is good to note, that as here he did shew himselfe to haue a good Faith towardes God; so it appeareth in like sort, to bee not a little clogged with his owne infirmity. He did shew himselfe heere to haue a good faith towards God, in that he did so readily acknowledge such a presence of God there, and yeil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded himselfe to be so well affected therewith, as then he was. That neuerthelesse it was not a little clogged with his owne infirmity, appeareth likewise, in that hee doth put ouer the matter so much as he doth, till he see the accomplishment of it so farre as to that his iourney appertained; and, hauing so great promises as hee had, neuerthelesse doth so specially stand vpon this his (so needefull) bodily maintenance in the meane season. Neere to the end of his iourney, which was about some three hundred miles or better (for all which space wee heare of no farther comfort giuen him: and that which is giuen vs by Christ already, is to serue vs for all our Pilgrimage heere) it pleased God againe to giue him another tast, that hee did prosper this his iourney vnto him. But heere where the Text saith, that he went, as our translations are, into the East-Countrey, and the originall it selfe doth say, that hee went into a Land of the Children of the East; and our Interpreters heereunto adde for exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="M"/> sake (as in in other such places besides) that <hi>Haran</hi> was East from whence <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> came; and yet in truth, it is rather North-East, and some-what more bending to the North, then to the East: Here it were good to note, once for all (as also for that place of <hi>Numbers</hi> 23: 7.) that in such places it seemeth, that the Coast of the world is taken by the Text more generally; namely, that all those Countries are counted the East in respect of those other two principall partes of the World, and not in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of this one little Countrey more specially. That other tast that now God did <note place="margin">Gen. 29. 1, 13.</note> giue him towardes the end of this his iourney, was, that not onely now hee found himselfe to be come right to the place where he would be: but also, that there at the first hee heard that his Vnckle <hi>Laban</hi> (to whom hee went) was well; and presently met with one of his Daughters there in the fielde, by occasion whereof himselfe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so was fetcht in by <hi>Laban</hi> himselfe. So it pleaseth God to ordaine to his Children very often, euen in the thinges of this World also, that hauing had in the way of his seruice some heauy beginning, they neuerthelesse finde a comfortable ending. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come now to the time of his being there, where he was (for the most part of his time) but in hard estate likewise, we are now to see the Story of it: but first, how hee was at the first kindly receiued; then, how afterward he was ill entreated. For his first receiuing it is cleere, that hee was very well vsed. For besides, that <hi>Laban</hi> did <note place="margin">Ge. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="92" facs="tcp:7530:58"/> that hee required <hi>Rachell</hi> his Daughter in marryage, hee also did not deny her vnto him. But now immediatly after began his hard vsage by his Vnckle: and yet, on his p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>t towards God, not altogether vndeserued neither. Yet was that no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse vnto <hi>Laban,</hi> who dealt indeede very hardly with him: first, in his marryage; then, in his Wages. In his marriage the hardnesse that towardes him he vsed, may seeme to be no more but one point of hard dealing onely; but beeing better consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, so it appeareth, that there was another in it besides: one, that most readily sheweth it selfe at the first; another, that dependeth thereon. That which most readily sheweth it selfe at the first, is, that when he had couenanted with him for <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chell,</hi> hee in her steede, vnwitting to him, giueth <hi>Lea</hi> vnto him: a matter that might <note place="margin">Ibid. 18, 23.</note> more easily be done as the vsage is saide to bee then, bringing them in to their Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands both without light, and couering them with a vaile besides; so farre yeelding vnto the shamefastnesse of young Women, as loath belike thereby to teach them to be ouer-bold, or to put away shamefastnesse from them, or, as wee say, to make ship-wracke of it. By which his doing, he did not onely a manifest wrong to his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="N"/> Nephew: but also shewed himselfe to make but ouer profaine an account of marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, and from thence did a wrong vnto the ordinance of God it selfe. That which depended thereon, was, that he draue <hi>Iacob</hi> thereby to a second marriage, because he had set his affection on <hi>Rachell</hi> before: who otherwise, it may be, at least for any thing that he may be entented to know to the contrary, would haue contented him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe with one alone. As touching his Wages he shewed himselfe at the first, to be a good vpright man in all such cases: but afterward it prooued not so indeede. Hee seemed to be an vpright man in all such cases, for that himselfe first began to put <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> in minde of bethinking himselfe what wages hee would looke to haue for doing <note place="margin">Ibid. 15.</note> him seruice: graunting, that albeit himselfe were Vnckle vnto him, yet was it no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so that he should take his seruice of him for naught; and so aduising him, to bethink himselfe what he should giue him. So is it with diuers of vs likewise, who in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall doe euer seeme to meane euery man his due at our handes: and in our owne mindes finde not oft-times that we haue any other meaning; and yet when we come to particulars, then start wee from the rule of equity cleane, eyther altogether blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, or else very partiall when it toucheth our selues. That so it fell out with him al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, notwithstanding this faire shew of his at the first, doth plainely appeare, first in deceiuing him in that very party for whom he had couenanted his first seauen yeares seruice, as we haue already seen: &amp; afterward, in his other Wages besides. Concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning which other wages of his, how hardly he dealt with him, we haue not set down originally, but yet rehearsed by <hi>Iacob</hi> twice, and in such sort, as it seemeth he would not doe it, vnlesse it were true: and farther adding, that God himselfe did in effect acknowledge so much also. He repeated vnto his Wiues first, that their Father had much deceiued him in his wages, and very often to his preiudice and losse (so far as <note place="margin">Gen. 31, 7, 8.</note> in him lay) altered the same; and then told his Vnckle himselfe, that he had oft chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged his Wages, and, but that God did prouide otherwise for him, hee would haue <note place="margin">Ibid 41-42.</note> sent him away empty also: both which, were so priuy to the dealing that passed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them, that it is not likely that hee would say otherwise to them, then the truth was indeede. That which he alleadgeth God himselfe to haue acknowledged, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth in these two pointes: one, that <hi>Laban</hi> dealt hardly with him; the other, that <note place="margin">Ibid. 9-13.</note> God himselfe brought it to passe, that <hi>Labans</hi> flockes did still so breede, as was so much to <hi>Iacobs</hi> behoofe. That this hard dealing was not altogether on his part to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God vndeserued, it seemeth to bee reasonable plaine likewise by the meanes that he vsed to attaine to the fauours that God did promise him: both concerning his posterity to come; and his present estate then. Concerning his posterity to come, whereas God had promised him it should be so great, that in his seede all the <note place="margin">Gen, 28, 14.</note> Kindreds of the Earth should bee blessed: hee both hastened thereunto by taking that liberty to haue many Wiues (then indeede much vsed, but euer swaruing from Gods holy ordinance;) and besides that, seemed to haue ouer slender regard of that holy seede, in imparting himselfe vnto so many, on so small occasion as then hee did. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="O"/> For he meant no marriage at all to <hi>Lea,</hi> at the first, though afterward hee continued <note place="margin">Ge. 29. 28, 35</note>
               <pb n="93" facs="tcp:7530:58"/> with her, and among others, by her had <hi>Iudah:</hi> and <hi>Bilha</hi> first, and <hi>Zilpha</hi> afterward, <note place="margin">Gen. 30. 1-4, 9</note> were brought vnto him in aemulation. Concerning his present estate, then it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted in two principall pointes: one, to attaine to the wages, that for his seruice was couenanted with him: the other, his returne home-ward againe. To obtaine the Wages which to him was promised, or rather to better it all that he could, hee might <note place="margin">Ibid. 37-42.</note> seeme to vse inordinate wayes, when hee prouided those speckled branches, and set his spotted Cattle before the others: and especially, that hee vsed such pollicy about the best and strongest of his Vnckles goods. For his returne home-ward hee tooke his iourney secretly on the suddaine, not onely vnwitting vnto his Vnckle, <note place="margin">Gen. 31, 17-21</note> vnder whom he had so speciall a charge: but also when hee was about speciall busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse farre distant from him. In all which thinges he had so plaine and pregnant pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises of God, and so good experience of his power to performe them, and of his great fauour to him besides, that the lesse it would become any Childe of God by such meanes to seeke to attaine his desire in any thing whatsoeuer, the more vnseem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly was it in him, and shewed his infirmity to be the greater, that in such sort he sought the accomplishment of them: a manifest patterne, that it was not any speciall good thing in him, for the which God was so fauourable vnto him, and so stood with him; but onely of his owne meere goodnesse towardes him, and for that he had promised <hi>Abraham</hi> to vse such fauour to his posterity. And how truely might <hi>Balaam,</hi> euen <note place="margin">Num, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Concerning that his encrease, we are to note, what it was: and whence it came. What it was, is set downe vnto vs, not onely generally: but more specially also. Generally it is saide, that hee did <note place="margin">Gen. 30. 43.</note> exceedingly encrease. More especially we finde that encrease of his to be set downe vnto vs, both in the people to him appertaining: and in his goodes or substance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides. His people were, first such as were neerer vnto him: then such as were some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what farther off. Those that were neerer vnto him, were <hi>Lea</hi> and <hi>Rachell; Zilpha</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ibid. 29, 16-30 Ibid. 31-35. and 30. 1-21.</note> and <hi>Bilha:</hi> and those Children those that now already hee had begotten of them, which were eleauen Sonnes, and one Daughter. Those that were somwhat farther off, were all those his Seruants, both Men and Women, that he had to attend his busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, wherein he is saide to haue abounded also: and himselfe confesseth, that nowe <note place="margin">Ibid. 30-43. Gen. 32, 10.</note> he was growne into a couple of bandes, or company enough to cast himselfe into a couple of reasonable battailes if neede shoulde bee; as also, the substance hee had importeth, that his Seruauntes must needs be many. For (now to come to it) although it be not set downe what it was: yet the present that he sent his Brother of that which presently came to hand, sheweth that his substance therein was great: <note place="margin">Ibid, 13-15.</note> those beeing of so many seuerall kindes, and all so plentifull in themselues. In his returne wee haue set downe, first the occasion of it: then, the manner. The <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="P"/> occasion of it wee may conceiue to be, partly in himselfe: but plainely wee finde in to proceede of others. Wee may conceiue it partly to be in himselfe, for that all men generally are desirous to returne to their Country, and vnto their naturall friends (and so doth <hi>Laban,</hi> who may seeme to know his mind therein, directly <note place="margin">Gen 31, 30.</note> tell him:) especially, when they haue attained to a better estate then before they had; and when themselues may so bee free, whereas they were in seruice before. Those others were, both men beneath: and God aboue. The men were, first <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bans</hi> Sonnes: then <hi>Laban</hi> himselfe.

God also himselfe (euer <note place="margin">Ibid, 2.</note> ready to helpe in time of neede, all such as he hath betaken himselfe vnto) did now bid him returne againe to his owne Countrey, and kindred: and withall promised, that himselfe would be with him. In the manner of his returne, wee are to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, how he began it at the first: and how he prosecuted the same to the end. He began it so at the first, as might indeede yeelde him some commendation of wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:7530:59"/> among men: but would note him withall of great weakenesse in faith to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes God. He might haue commendation of wisedome among men, for that he did carry himselfe therein so cunningly as he did: both in taking so fit a time; and in vsing it so warily too. Hee tooke a fit time to his purpose, for that it was when his Vnckle <hi>Laban</hi> was forth, about speciall businesse: and, three dayes iourney off be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides. <note place="margin">Gen. 30, 36. 31, 19-22.</note> He did warily vse it, both in preparing the way to his purpose: and in taking the benefite of it when it was prepared. He prepared the way vnto it, in that both he sent for <hi>Rachell</hi> and <hi>Lea</hi> to come vnto him where hee was in the fieldes: and in that he vsed such speech vnto them as he did, when they were come. That he sent for them thither, rather then brake the matter vnto them at home, was a great deale more <note place="margin">Ibid, 4.</note> fit for his purpose, both for security; and, if they should consent vnto him, then to haue then in readinesse also. In his speach vnto them hee seemeth to endeauour to perswade them in these two thinges: first, that they had iust occasion now to depart; then, that they had neede so to do it, as that their Father might not hinder them nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, so neere as might be. To perswade them that they had iust occasion now to depart, hee alledgeth; first, that of late their Father did not beare him the like coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, now, that he was wont to doe before (and that might boad, that hee was <note place="margin">Ibid, 5.</note> halfe weary of their company now:) then also, that God had now bin with him, &amp; had willed him to depart thence vnto his owne country againe. To perswade them, <note place="margin">Ibid. &amp; 13.</note> that they neede so to depart, as that it were not to bee left to their Fathers curtesie, whether he would hinder thē or not, first he laieth before them certaine hard dealing of his before, so to put them in some feare of it at this time also: and then remoueth a certaine let out of the Way, that might otherwise bee some hindrance vnto them. To shew their Fathers hard dealing to him before, he referreth himselfe to their own <note place="margin">Gen. 31, 6.</note> knowledge; first, whether himselfe had not to the vttermost of his power serued their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Q"/> Father: then, how hard their Father had dealt with him again. As touching the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer of them, it is a cleere thing in the iudgment of al, that the good &amp; faithful seruice of any, is well to be regarded of those that haue the benefit of it. As touching the latter, he noteth two thinges in him: first that he mocked him, which was, as it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, <note place="margin">Ibid. 7. 8.</note> in not keeking couenant with him: the other, that oft-times hee changed his Wages, so to wring him euer to the worse. The let that might hinder them from this perswasion, was, that by some ill meanes of his he might so farre haue enriched himselfe of their Fathers substance. Concerning which, first he telleth them gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, that it was Gods doing, and not his: namely, that God did not suffer him so to <note place="margin">Ibid. 7, 9.</note> wring him to the worse, by so oft changing his wages, though himselfe would faine haue done it; and that it was God, and not he, that so tooke away their Fathers sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, &amp; bestowed the same on him. Then, more specially he acquainteth them with a speciall vision he had concerning that matter, and some what else concerning theyr present businesse then. Concerning that vision, that God himselfe on a time called on him by night, and bad him see, howe that at Ramming-time those that engendred, <note place="margin">Ibid. 11. 12.</note> were all such or so marked, as was to him for his Wages allotted; and that himselfe did then see it to be so indeede: and withall told him the reason of it, which was for <note place="margin">Ibid. 10.</note> that <hi>Laban</hi> did deale so hardly with him. Concerning their present businesse, that he told him besides, that he was the same God Almighty that appeared vnto him at <note place="margin">Ibid. 12.</note>
               <hi>Bethel,</hi> vnto whom he erected a Monument, and made a vow: and now willed him, <note place="margin">Ibid. 13.</note> to get vp, and to depart thence, and returne home-wards againe. By which speach of his, they were both so fully resolued, that themselues did acknowledge, that they <note place="margin">Ibid. 14-16.</note> had naught else to looke for at the hands of their Father; that he had dealt vnkindly with them, making sale of them to his own aduantage: now therefore, that whereas God had giuen them that which they had, to the vse of themselues, and of their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, it was no reason that he shold vse the same at his pleasure. So their conclusion is, that by their assent hee should readily doe whatsoeuer the Lord had appointed vnto him. They being thus perswaded, and so a ready way beeing now made vnto his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne, hee did as readily take the benefit of it. For presently he made away, taking his Wiues and Children with him, and all the Cattle and goodes that there hee had gotten, and got not onely ouer <hi>Euphrates</hi> the Riuer, but euen to Mount <hi>Galiad,</hi> (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <note place="margin">Ibid. 17-21.</note>
               <pb n="95" facs="tcp:7530:59"/> three partes of fiue, of all the way that he had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> trauell, came thither also: <hi>Iacob</hi> hauing made a stand, and pitched his Tentes there before; there belike, to refresh himselfe and all his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and his Cattle withall, after that their iourney. In this sort to haue begun his returne, howe it may note him of weaknesse in faith before God, if now wee would finde, it shall be good to consider of this his doing: first, as if it had beene <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="R"/> but the common case of any; then, as it was more proper to him. If it had been the case of any, yet both Equity and Ciuility had required, that hyred seruantes, and friendes that had beene of so neere alliance, if a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> any time their occasions re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired that they should depart, or otherwise were so disposed themselues: yet, they should doe it in good manner so neere as they could; seruants taking theyr leaue of their Maisters, and friendes not parting with any of their friendes, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ut in ciuill and friendly manner. And though the case be such, that those maysters or friendes, haue already sufficiently declared themselues, that they would not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly part with such Seruants or friendes: yet is it euer to be hoped, that by goods meanes they may he entreated; especially, if their occasions bee iust, or but theyr owne mindes resolutely bent thereupon. As the case was more proper to him, hee had taken his Maisters Daughters and Seruants in marriage: and had speciall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises of God besides. Hauing taken his Maysters Daughters and Seruantes in marriage, though himselfe (not beeing so neere) had farther liberty: yet both his Wiues and their Children did owe more duty, from the which hee might not well exempt them. Hauing so good promises of God as hee had, both before at his first setting out, and now againe, when hee was to returne, howe much better and <note place="margin">Gen. 28, 15, 31, 3.</note> more seemely had it beene for him, so confidently to haue rested thereon, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> that in no wise he would depart, but in the best manner he could deuise, to the glorie of him that in all thinges stood so fast vnto him, and for his owne credite withall? Might not he haue hoped, that God would much better haue blessed any orderly and honourable dealing of his, then this his inordinate and base departure? His returne being thus begun, now are we see, how hee did prosecute the same to the end: first, how he dealt with two speciall impediments in the way: then, how hee held on the course of his iourny. Those two impediments that were in the way, were one of them this pursute of his late Mast. his vnckle <hi>Laban:</hi> the other of his brother <hi>Esau.</hi> This pursute of <hi>Laban</hi> stood for a time in some contention betwixt thēselues: but ended at length with good agreement. While it stoode in some contention betwixt themselues, each of them disburtheneth his griefe to the other: <hi>Laban</hi> first; and <hi>Iacob</hi> after. <hi>Laban</hi> disburdened his stomacke to <hi>Iacob</hi> not onely in word but also in deede. When he doth it onely by word, he then receiueth an answere from <hi>Iacob:</hi> where we are to consider, first what he layeth to <hi>Iacobs</hi> charge; then how <hi>Iacob</hi> doth giue him his answere. That which hee layeth to <hi>Iacobs</hi> charge, resteth in effest, in two principall poynts: one of them, much amplyfied also; the other (to speake of) but briefely touched. In that which is so carefully amplyfied, it is not amisse to marke, not onely what it is: but also what may seeme to be the reason, why he was so carefull to amplyfie it. It was no more but this, that he stole away so secretly from him. That which may seeme to be the reason, why he was so carefull to amplyfie it, was, for that himselfe did know, that by the reason that so <note place="margin">Ge. 31: 26-29.</note> often before he had dealt so hardly with him, he had in that least aduantage against him: as thereby hauing giuen him so iust cause to doubt him, that now of necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty hee must thinke lesse with him, that so he sought to cleere himselfe of him. And experience doth often teach, that such is the manner of the Children of the world, in many of their dealings with the Children of God, readily to make Mountaines of Mole-hils, when they are disposed to quarrell with them. In that which is but briefely touched, it is in like manner good to marke, not onely what the same was: but also, what may seeme to be the reason why he was so short therein. The charge it selfe was, that hee had stoln away his gods too. That hee was so short <note place="margin">Ibid. 30.</note>
               <pb n="96" facs="tcp:7530:60"/> therein, it was, as to me it seemeth, not that himselfe made not great reckoning of <note place="margin">Ibid. 33-35.</note> them (for he made great search for them;) not for that he thought it would bee but a scorue with <hi>Iacob,</hi> for him to shew that he put any confidence in such (for <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> himselfe doth shew by yeelding to death for him that had done it, that he also <note place="margin">Ibid. 32.</note> made not so light of such matters neyther:) but onely for that hee thought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe therein to haue the aduantage against him, in as large manner as hee could wish; and the same so plainely too, that it would be cleere beyond the helpe of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny excuse. For so also the Children of the world resemble running waters, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king most noyce where they are the shallowest, and beeing the stillest, where, by their depths, they are most daungerous. The aunswere of <hi>Iacob</hi> to this his Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kles charge, was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, and plain: first shewing the cause why he got away so secret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from him; then, yeelding for the matter of theft, altogether as much as himselfe could desire. That so secretly hee fled away from him, hee could him the reason <note place="margin">Ibid, 31.</note> was, for that he feared that some way or other hee would deale hardly with him: and, it might be, euen by force take away his Daughters from him. As concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that matter of theft, hee craueth no sparing, but readily yeeldeth that it bee punnished with death, if it found with any of his: and further addeth, that hee would not haue him to spare, but to search through all his thinges, and if he found <note place="margin">Ibid. 32.</note> any thing at all that was his, with good will to take it vnto him againe. That <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban,</hi> not onely in word, but also in deede, dis burthened his stomacke to <hi>Iacob,</hi> may appeare plainely enough in this, that he made so great a search throughout the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall <note place="margin">Ibid, 33-35.</note> Tents of euery one: not onely of his owne Daughters and maid-ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, with whom he might be the boulder (albeit that now, hauing giuen them in marriage, he had so farre abandoned his Aucthority ouer them) but also of <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> himselfe too, which, of the two, was much the harder. Now therefore <hi>Iacob,</hi> when his Vncle had made such search, and yet found nothing to charge him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, hereupon began to disburthen his heart to him likewise: both as touching <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="T"/> his former dealing with him before; and as touching that present dealing with him then also. As touching the former, it shall be good for vs to marke, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly what it was that was sayd: but also, what wee may gather thereof, in respect of <note place="margin">Ibid. 36-41.</note> the parties to whom it was spoken. That which was sayd, was in effect no more but this, that he had painfully and faithfully serued him twenty yeares-long: and <note place="margin">Ibid. 36-41.</note> yet, that euer he dealt vnkindly, and hardly with him. Being spoken, as it was, to <hi>Laban</hi> himselfe, and in the presence of his friends he brought with him, and of his owne company besides (who by all likeli-hood knew for the most part of them, whether he spake truely or not) we are not to doubt, but that hee spake the very truth: and then haue we therein, both a good patterne of a good Seruant in him; and withall how God is wont oft-times to try them. A good pattern we haue of a very good Seruant, in that hee dealt so well with his Maister: when his Maister notwithstanding dealt so ill with him. Hee dealt well with Maister both in his faithfulnesse, and painefulnesse too. His faithfulnesse was such, that in twenty yeares space, he neuer so chaced either those flockes of sheepe, or heards of Goats <note place="margin">Ibid. 38, 39.</note> that he had vnder his handes, nor otherwise handled them eyther so hardly or so vnskilfully, that at any time they cast their young: neyther yet suffered his Maister to haue any losse in his stocke, neither himselfe at any time taking any part of them; nor making his Maister to beare what wilde beastes or theeues had gotten, but himselfe making good vnto him all such casualties whatsoeuer. His painefulnesse also was such (a good example for all Seruants generally, and especially for so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of vs as feare God in the Ministery) that hee spared not to attend his charge for any distemperature of wether, neither for the burning heate of the day, nor for the cold frost in the night: and that himselfe brake his sleepe so oft in that his busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, that he brought himselfe to that case thereby, that hee could not rest when fainest hee would. How God is wont oft-times to try good Seruaunts also, doth heere likewise indifferent plainely appeare: when as this man did so hardly deale <note place="margin">Ge. 30: 27, 28.</note> with so good a seruant, when as himselfe did sensibly feele that he was so much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased by him, and therefore was so loath to part with him; and when as he was
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:7530:60"/> his Vnckle besides, and now his Father-in-Lawe likewise. But when God had tryed him a while, he did plentifully reward him after: whereas on the other side, the world neuer so rewardeth those that serue it most, but that it depriueth them (for all their seruice) of much better thinges then it doth giue them. As touching <note place="margin">Ibid. 36, 37, 42</note> the latter, that without any sufficient cause he had thus hotly pursued him, &amp; made such search: and euen now, if God had not stood with him, he would surely haue sent him empty away. Thus hauing both disburthened their mindes each to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, then began they to fall to agreement: <hi>Laban</hi> first offering the same; and <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> then ioyning with him therein. But seeing the motion came first from <hi>Laban,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ibid. 29.</note>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="V"/> who notwithstanding, as it seemeth by his owne words, was at that time the stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in the fielde, it shall bee good to consider, what may seeme to haue giuen the occasion, that he should first make this motion: then, what was the motion it selfe. The occasion may well seeme to be, that the Lord met with him the night before, <note place="margin">Ibid. 24.</note> and did plainly shew himselfe to take part with <hi>Iacob</hi> against him: which also him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe in plaine tearmes confesseth. A point of wisedome, which many in our <note place="margin">29.</note> age cannot yet learne: when they plainely see, the word of God to iustify that profession which goeth vnder the name of the Gospell now, yet neuer regarding to come to agreement with those that professe it, and withall, stand to the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of it; but still continuing enemies vnto them. The motion that heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon hee made was for good neighbour-hood and friendship betwixt them: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which, first he sheweth how he can now quiet himselfe towards <hi>Iacob</hi> for this his so priuy getting away from him before: and then commeth forth with the motion it selfe. He sheweth that now hee can quiet himselfe towardes him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that his Wiues being his Daughters and their Children, in effect, or in some <note place="margin">Ibid. 43-45.</note> manner, his likewise, and so all their substance, in that sence, much respecting him also: he could not now be any way auenged of him for that his disorderly depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but that he must therewith also giue a wound vnto himselfe. In the motion it selfe we are to consider: first, of that which concerneth the substance of it: then of one other accident, that after a sort it selfe also belonged vnto it, and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately came in thereupon. In that which concerneth the substance of it, it shall be good to note; first, howe either of them dealt therein apart by themselues: then of that wherein they ioyned both together. For the former of which it is declared, that <hi>Laban</hi> first made the motion: then, that <hi>Iacob</hi> did readily ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of it. The motion as <hi>Laban</hi> made it, was, that there might bee a couenant betwixt them, to put them in minde, from that time forward of good and friendlie dealing betwixt them: wherein wee are more specially to note, what good dealing it is that he doth more specially require; and in what sort he would haue the same to be ratified betwixt them. The good dealing that hee required, was in two princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall pointes: one to bee performed by <hi>Iacob</hi> onely; the other to bee performed by both. That which was to be performed by <hi>Iacob</hi> onely, was, that hee should take vnto him none other Wiues: but onely rest contented with those that now already <note place="margin">Ibid. 50.</note> he had of <hi>Laban.</hi> That which was to bee performed by them both, was, that ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them should passe ouer that Hill to the hurt of the other. Hee would haue <note place="margin">Ibid. 52.</note> the same ratified betwixt them, not onely by the God of <hi>Abraham:</hi> but also by the Goddes of <hi>Nahor;</hi> yea, and by the Goddes of <hi>Terah</hi> too, the Father of them <note place="margin">Ibid. 53.</note> both. So it seemeth they are all alike with him (aswell, as with such like, in this age of ours:) and yet can hardly thinke, that hauing them all, hee hath any to spare, but <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="W"/> rather that yet also hee hath not enow. As touching <hi>Iacob, Laban</hi> had no sooner mooued the matter, but that he by and by, was as ready to reare vp a stone for a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument <note place="margin">Ibid. 45, 46.</note> of it: yea, and to will his company also to doe the like, who accordingly quickly gathered and laide together an heape of stones meet for the purpose, That wherein they both ioyned together was in the couenant it selfe, and in the Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the same: both putting to their hands to the erecting of it, and both agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">Ibid. &amp; 47-49 51, 53.</note> in the Name whereby it should after be called, and iumping together in the sense and meaning of it, sauing that eyther of them vsed their owne languge therein. That other accident, that (after a sort) it selfe also belonged vnto it, and immediately after
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:7530:61"/> came in thereupon, was the kind dealing of each to other: <hi>Iacob</hi> feasting his Vnc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle <note place="margin">Ibid. 54▪ 55.</note> and his company there; and <hi>Laban</hi> likewise the next morning, before his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne, kindly taking his leaue of them all. In that other impediment, which was of his Brother <hi>Esau,</hi> we are likewise to see, what the impediment it selfe was: and how he got himselfe cleered of that also. The impediment it selfe was, the feare that he had of his Brother <hi>Esau,</hi> which now as it seemeth, did arise vnto him, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, out of that old displeasure of his Brothers against him: and partly, out of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine report that lately he heard. That old displeasure of his Brothers against him, was about his Birth-right and blessing; both which <hi>Iacob</hi> as wee saw before, had gotten from him: and <hi>Esau</hi> againe, though he made no great businesse for his Birth-right, yet when he saw hee had beguiled him of his blessing also, then hee was so grieued with him, that hee purposed to slay him for it. A good patterne, what manner of Dregs they are, that sin is wont to leaue behinde it: plunging our hearts in some speciall feare, when fainest we would be freed from it. The report <note place="margin">Ibid. 32, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> that then hee lately heard which increased the same, was, that when himselfe had sent his Brother word of his returne, and how God had blessed him in that his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice abroad, hee heard by those that hee sent him, that his Brother met him with foure hundred men. How he got himselfe cleered of this his feare, that now we may the better finde, we are to note, that as there were (as it were) two braunches of it; so did hee likwise endeuour to cleere himselfe in eyther of them: in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, by so kinde sending vnto his Brother; in the latter, by diuers other good meanes besides. In such sending before to his Brother (giuing him to vnderstand <note place="margin">Ibid. 3-5.</note> where hee had beene all this time of his absence, and how God had blessed him) he did therein, as it is the manner of the deerest friendes to do, acquainting one another with their estate as occasion is offered: and so witnesseth vnto his Brother a louing and dutifull heart towardes him; so the rather to procure the like in his Brother to him againe. In those meanes that hee vsed in the latter, that is, when his former feare was by that report of his Messengers confirmed and increased in him, we are first to see, what comfort hee bad before against it: and yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, what meanes he vsed. The comfort that he had, was, first in those former <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="X"/> promises of God: but thē also, in that late vision of Angels which ther he had. Those former promises of God, were of great security to him, both when first hee was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into this iourny, &amp; when now he began to returne again: of which also he had for the time good experience already: the vigor whereof ought yet to haue bin so strong in his hart, that he should not haue bin so much afraid. In that vision of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, which it pleased God then to vouchsafe him (for the Angels of God, as by the <note place="margin">Ge. 32, 1, 2.</note> distance of the place it appeareth, did meete him, soone after that <hi>Laban</hi> went from him, as also in the Text it selfe it followeth immediatly after) hee might also gather, both that the Angels of God were neerer vnto him then hee was aware of: and that then especially they were made to appeare vnto him to some speciall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and in token of Gods protection; and therefore most likely, seeing that was now his greatest feare, that it was to strengthen him therein. The meanes that neuerthelesse be vsed, were diuers and good: wherein we are to consider, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly what they were; but also what successe they had in the end. Seeking out what they were, there we find, that first his care was to saue but onely some part of that which he had; but yet, that by and by after, hee aduanced himselfe to the care of all. To saue but onely some part of that which he had, he presently vpon that mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage being strucken with great feare, diuided all that he had both people and stock, <note place="margin">Ibid, 7, 8.</note> into two parts; to the end, that while <hi>Esau</hi> should fall on the one to destroy it, the other might scape in the meane season: a manifest token that yet he was weak, and did not put any great confidence in those notable promises that God had giuen him. That neuerthelesse he by and by after aduanced himselfe to the care of all, it appeareth in that which presently followed: first seeking to God by Prayer; then comming downe vnto inferior meanes besides. In his prayer hee acknowledgeth, <note place="margin">Ibid, 9-12.</note> that he is altogether vnworthy of those fauours, that God had already bestowed on him; vvhereas hee went ouer that Riuer <hi>Iordan</hi> at the first, but onely with his
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:7530:61"/> staffe in his hand, he now was growne so very great: but then, whereas it had plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed him before, to vouchsafe to bee the God of his Fathers, <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Isaac,</hi> (when as indeede he was the Lord ouer all) and now since he had beene so fauoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to him also, that not onely for that present time, himselfe had willed him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne, and promised to be with him, but also for the time to come, had promised to make him a great people; it would therefore please him, to deliuer him out of the handes of his Brother <hi>Esau,</hi> least that he in his wrath might happily put them all to the Sword. Hauing in this sort sought vnto God, and then comming downe to inferior meanes, we finde those to bee two: one, the presentes that hee sent before; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Y"/> the other, a fit behauiour besides. As touching the presents that he sent before, we haue set downe; first, what he did therein: then, what comfort immediatly after hee receiued thereon. That which he did therein, we find to be this, that the selfe-same night he tooke forth vnto him two hundred Shee-Goates, and twenty He-Goates; two hundred Ewes, and twenty Rammes; thirty Milch-Camels, with their Coults; forty Kine, and ten Bullockes; She-Asses twenty, and ten Foales: and these he sent away before him, by seuerall Messengers, and in seuerall companies, with some rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable distance betwixt them, to be all deliuered to his Brother <hi>Esau,</hi> as a token and present from him. A present sufficient in it selfe, to witnesse that hee was growne very great: and out of which <hi>Esau</hi> might likewise gather, that his Brother had a brotherly and a louing respect vnto him. The comfort that he immediatly after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued thereon, was, that now passing ouer the Riuer <hi>Iabok,</hi> and getting ouer the rest of his company and Cattle besides, and beeing alone, an Angell, in the likenesse <note place="margin">Ibid. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 span">

Which his posterity following, might better haue applyed to their edifying, by humbling themselues in the infirmity of that their Ancestor: then, in forbearing to eate of that Sinnew, in such beasts as they fed vpon. The fit behauiour that wee speake of, was partly appointed by him to others: and partly performed by himselfe also. Those others to whom hee appointed such behauiour as the case nowe required, were first those Seruants of his whom he sent before him with his present to his Brother: then also, his Wiues and Children. That which he appointed to his Seruants, was, to go in <note place="margin">Ge. 32: 16-20</note> such order as he appointed, euery company by it selfe, keeping a reasonable distance betwixt them: and, when they met with his Brother, to do all dutifull reuerence vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him; and in their speeches to tearme him the Lorde of <hi>Iacob,</hi> and <hi>Iacob</hi> his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant. His Wiues and Children he also directed vnto their order: and by likelihood, directed them also to that dutifull reuerence, that immediatly after, when they came in <hi>Esaus</hi> presence, they yeelded vnto him. That which was by himselfe performed, was, that hee also behaued himselfe most dutifully and lowly vnto his Brother (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding those promises of security before: as many of vs, on any part of such <note place="margin">Ibid. 3.</note> ground of security otherwise, would not) often bowing himselfe vnto him before he came at him; and in all his speech with him, calling him <hi>Esau</hi> his Lord, and himselfe <note place="margin">Ibid. 5. 8, 13. 14, 15.</note> his Seruant. A very good patterne, how we should humble our selues one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther when we haue offended: euen the Children of God that haue the promises, to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Z"/> the Children of the World that haue them not. These good meanes of reconcili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation being by <hi>Iacob</hi> vsed, now are we to see what successe they had in the end: and first, at the very first meeting of them; then, in the residue of that small time that they were together. The first meeting of them was comfortable, for that so soone as they drewe some-what neere, <hi>Esau</hi> ranne to meete his Brother, imbraced and kissed him very kindly, and wept for ioy: and beholding his Wiues and Children, gentlie inquired of them also (and by likelihood yeelded some curteous welcome to them <note place="margin">Ibid. 4. 5.</note> likewise▪ according to the manner that in those partes was at that time vsed) as also
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:7530:62"/> of the presents which he had met, in curteous manner offering therein, not to bee so <note place="margin">Ibid. 8. 11.</note> chargeable vnto him, yet, at his instance, gently accepting them in the end. In the residue of that small time that they were together, hee offered to his Brother two other curtesies before he departed: one, that himselfe and all his company would go on with him, &amp; cleere the way before him; the other, when <hi>Iacob</hi> had desired him not <note place="margin">Ibid. 12.</note> so farre to trouble himselfe, that yet hee would appoint some of his company to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend him. Which when <hi>Iacob,</hi> but in dutifull manner refused also, then hee retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <note place="margin">Ibid. 13-15. Ibid. 16.</note> home-ward againe. So may <hi>Esau</hi> bee a good patterne to vs, not to maintaine enmity still: especially when as in any good manner we are sought vnto to be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled. These two impediments being remooued, now are wee to see, how he held on the rest of his iourney, returning home-ward. Concerning which, although it be not certaine in what time he finished the rest of his iourney, yet it seemeth that he made no great hast to get home: but yet notwithstanding went on forward still, till in the end he attained vnto it. That he made no great hast to get home, it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth both by building an house at <hi>Succoth,</hi> and by buying a parcell of Land at <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chem:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ibid. 17. Ibid. 19.</note> and so may it be some instruction to vs against that immoderate desire that Parents and Children sometimes haue of beeing together, and of the ydle visiting that friendes doe oft-times make one of another; in the meane season omitting di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers more needfull points of their duties: especially where as <hi>Iacob</hi> was, when nowe he came from his Vnckle <hi>Laban,</hi> fourescore and seuenteen years old, and <hi>Isaac</hi> his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther one hundred fifty and seauen. How notwithstanding hee went on forward still, till hee got home in the ende, wee are to note, that for a time hee held on the straight or direct way thither: but then was hee turned a little aside. Hee held on the straight way thither, first to <hi>Succoth,</hi> neare vnto <hi>Iordan,</hi> but yet on the East-side of it: then to <hi>Sichem</hi> on this side <hi>Iordan,</hi> and a good way within, in the heart of the Land. At <hi>Succoth</hi> he builded an house for himselfe to soiourne in for the time, and <note place="margin">Ibid, 17.</note> boothes for his Cattell: belike conceiuing well of the place to such a purpose, and so giuing it the name accordingly. To <hi>Sichem</hi> hee came safe, himselfe and his; and there bought a parcell of ground, and worshipped God: but there did he finde some <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A2"/> trouble now; first in a villanie done to his Daughter, then also, about the reuenge of it by two of his Sons. As touching that villanie done to his Daughter, it is good to note, what may seem to be some occasion of it: &amp; then, what was the villanie it selfe. <note place="margin">Gen. 34, 1.</note> It may seeme to be some occasion of it, that her parents did suffer her, and herselfe would needes goe forth into the Citty, to see the young Woemen of that Countrey: and then is it a good warning to vs, that such as professe a care of religion, and of an honest and orderly carriage of themselues in all their wayes, to take good heede, so neere as they can, that they neuer come into the company of the looser sort: not, but that oft-times it is done without hurt ensuing thereon, by the goodnesse and help of God; especially, when any way wee haue iust cause so to doe: but that, when as of lightnesse or vanity we doe it, hauing no iust cause vnto it, wee then step without the bounds of Gods protection; and hee oft-times doth not let it escape vnpunnished. The villany it selfe was, that she was defloured; and that by one of the chiefest in all the Citty: and yet not otherwise, but that withall he did afterward very earnestly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire <note place="margin">Ibid, 2-6.</note> to haue her in marriage. In the trouble that hee found by occasion of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenging of this villainy, we haue set downe; first, what was the reuenge it selfe: then howe hee was troubled at it. The reuenge it selfe was, that <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Leuie,</hi> the Bretherrn of <hi>Dina,</hi> being very much grieued with it, and yet dissembling the same <note place="margin">Ibid. 7-29.</note> for a time, and in the meane season, seeking to frame an occasion that was offered, to serue their owne cruell designes, within fewe dayes after getting all the men of the Citty within their danger, put thē all to the Sword, vtterly spoyled the Citty besides, and tooke away their Sister with them. A very strange and fearefull example, what wonderfull great measure of wrath may in the Iustice of God bee due, euen vnto whole peoples and Citties, for the offence and trespasse of one: and that not doone to any of their owne, but to a straunger; and the fame much mittigated againe (in the iudgement of flesh and blood) by a speciall loue to the party most wronged, and an earnest desire, in the noblest of them all, to haue her in marriage. The trouble
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:7530:62"/> that <hi>Iaacob</hi> found heerein so farre as himselfe did <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> the same, was for the danger that now he found himselfe to be in: which was, that the odiousnesse of this strange and barbarous crueltie of theirs, would make all the people thereabout to gather <note place="margin">Ibid. 30. 31.</note> themselues together, and vtterly to destroy them all; which notwithstanding was little regarded, by the executioners of that fierce and strange reuenge. Hitherto, keeping the readiest way, his iourney still lying towards the South, and some-what inclining to the West, now by occasion he is turned aside, much towardes the East: but then he thence goeth forward againe. When now hee is turned towardes the East, we are first to consider the occasion of it: then the Story of that part of his iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. The occasion of it was, that God now did will him to goe to <hi>Bethel,</hi> where <note place="margin">G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>. 35, 1,</note> God before appeared vnto him, when he fled from the wrath of his Brother <hi>Esau:</hi> there to make his aboad for a time; and there to erect an Altar vnto him. Thus was God, in great mercy ready now to giue him directions what to do, when he was in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B 2"/> great perplexity, &amp; doubted heauy things to be towards him. The Story of that part of his iourny, deuideth it selfe into two principall parts: first, their going thither; then what was done there. In their going thither, we are to note somthing concerning thē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues: &amp; somthing concerning others. That which concerneth themselues, is, in how good manner they addressed themselues thither, both <hi>Iacob</hi> himselfe, &amp; al his cōpany so far as they went: wherein notwithstanding it may seeme, that something was by them omitted. That yet neuertheles they did very wel so farre as they went, appeareth first in <hi>Iacob</hi> himselfe: then in his company. For <hi>Iacob</hi> himselfe gaue commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <note place="margin">Ibid. 2.</note> to all his company to put away from them all the straunge Goddes they had among them; then also, to cleanse themselues, and to change their Rayment, or to put on their better or cleaner Apparrell: giuing them withall to vnderstand, that <note place="margin">Ibid. 3.</note> now they would go vp to <hi>Bethel,</hi> there to Sacrifice to the mighty God, who had heard him in the day of his trouble, and was euer since with him in all his iourney. His company likewise thereupon, forthwith deliuered vnto him not onely all those their Idolles themselues: but also all their ear-rings beside, which (belike) they had vsed in some Rite or Ceremony of such Goddes as they serued before. Which when <hi>Iacob</hi> had secretly buried, to abolish the memory of them, then setting in hand with their iourney, they readily came to the place they desired: both hee, and all his company with him. That which may seeme to be omitted, was, that wee read not of any repentance, sorrowing, and speciall cleansing; or else with-drawing of themselues to be enioyned to <hi>Simion</hi> and <hi>Leui,</hi> that presently before had done that great slaughter on the <hi>Sichemites,</hi> and had made such a spoyle of all that they had. So that this must either be accounted by them no more then a iust reuenge for the villany done vnto <hi>Dinah:</hi> or else, had it also neede to haue beene specially regarded when they went to worship God; being otherwise such a strange out-rage as it was, and so freshly bleeding as yet. That which concerneth others, was, that God did put such a feare into the hearts of all the people thereabout, that none of them made head after these to be auenged on them for the barbarous cruelty, as they might take <note place="margin">Num. 23, 21.</note> it done to their Neighbors: another pregnant Testimony, that God seeth no ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity in <hi>Iacob;</hi> no transgression in <hi>Israel.</hi> That which was done there, did most of it concerne their present businesse: but one thing there was of another kinde. That which concerned their present businesse, was first no more, then for the which hee now came thether: but then, by occasion, some-what else besides. That for the <note place="margin">Gen 35. 7.</note> which he now came thether, was no more in plaine tearmes, but onely to build an Altar vnto the Lord, which also he did; but no doubt, implyed withall, that both he and his company there worshipped also; and that the reason was, because God had so comfortably shewed himselfe to him there, when he did flee from the wrath of his brother. In that which he did more as occasion was offered, we are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider; first, what was the occasion that was giuen: then, what it was that hee did <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C 2"/> besides. The occasion that then was giuen, was; that God did now agayne so comfortably appeare vnto him there: which also we finde, both in the manner of his appearing vnto him; and in those fauours that at this present hee did vouchsafe him. As touching the manner of his appearing now vnto him; whereas it is after <note place="margin">Ibid. 13.</note>
               <pb n="102" facs="tcp:7530:63"/> faide, that when he had done, be then ascended vp from him, thereby wee perceiue, that he did not now appeare vnto him so high from him, as hee did in that place be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: but more familiarly and neerer vnto him on the earth beneath. The fauours that at this present hee did vouchsafe him, were, in that little space at two seuerall times deliuered vnto him. For first he blessed him: and confirmed vnto him nowe againe that new and more honourable name that before hee gaue him, which was, <note place="margin">Ibid. 9, 10.</note> that thence-forth he should not onely bee called <hi>Iacob,</hi> but <hi>Israell</hi> also. Then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine <note place="margin">Ibid. 11. 12.</note> he told him, that he was the God almightie; and willed him to encrease and multiply: giuing him to vnderstand, that much people should come of him, and, among them, euen Kings too; and▪ as touching that land wherein he was, as before he had giuen it to <hi>Abraham</hi> and to <hi>Isaac,</hi> so did he confirme the selfe-same graunt to him likewise, namely, that his seede should haue it indeede. Which being sayde, then there he left him. That which heereupon <hi>Iacob</hi> did besides, did partly respect <note place="margin">Ibid, 13.</note> the time present: and partly also the time to come. For the time present, hee rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vp a monument heereof, of the stones there: and thereon made an offering be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides. <note place="margin">Ibid. 14.</note> For the time to come, hee honoured the place with the Title or Name of <note place="margin">Ibid. 15.</note>
               <hi>The House of God.</hi> That one thing that was of another kinde, was, that <hi>Debo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra</hi> the Nursse of <hi>Rebecca</hi> (who, as it seemeth, hauing before returned to her Country againe, for good will to her Nursse-childe, was now comming backe with thys her Sonne <hi>Iacob</hi> to see her againe) dying heere, they buried her vnder an Oake there, &amp; called that Tree the <hi>Oake of Lamentation.</hi> Concerning which, although there be <note place="margin">Ibid. 8.</note> no more saide in the Text, yet because the name of that Tree doth directly lead vs to this, that there they made some lamentation for her; it seemeth there were some speciall good parts in the woman; at least, some speciall kindnesse towards them. For she could not be but of verie great age, <hi>Iacob</hi> himselfe being now almost an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yeare old, and, <hi>Rebecca</hi> his Mother about forty before she had him. But as this consideration of her age might in some respect giue them reasonable content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, not to take her death so heauily: so doth it the stronglyer leade vs to gather, that seeing yet notwithstanding they did so lament it (and we read of no such lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation <note place="margin">Ibid. 19, 20.</note> for <hi>Rachel</hi> shortly after, whom notwithstanding he specially loued) both that there was some speciall cause why so they did; and that <hi>Iacob</hi> and his companie, so farre as in them was, did kindly and thankefully requite the same. Hence going on forward in his iourney, we haue mentioned of two places yet before he came home: the former of them, not farre from <hi>Beethlem;</hi> the other, beyond the Tower of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D. 2"/> flocke, which was neere vnto it also. In that which was not farre from <hi>Bethleem; Rachel</hi> trauelled, and brought foorth another sonne, whom her-selfe woulde haue <note place="margin">Ibid. 16-18.</note> tearmed the <hi>Childe of her sorrow</hi> (for shee dyed of him) but his Father tearmed him deare vnto him, and so was he called <hi>Beniamin.</hi> So <hi>Iacob</hi> buried <hi>Rachel</hi> there: and erected a Monument in memory of her. In that which was beyond the Tower <note place="margin">Ibid. 19, 20.</note> afore▪saide, <hi>Ruben</hi> his eldest Sonne committed that fault with his Fathers Concubine <hi>Billa,</hi> for the which he was afterward depriued of the right of elder-ship: &amp; so had <hi>Iacob</hi> the end of his iourney mingled with sorrow. Immediately after which (for any thing we read of, that came betwixt) <hi>Iacob</hi> came to his Father to <hi>Hebron.</hi> But <note place="margin">Gen 25 37.</note> neither is the certaine time knowne when it was; and sure we are, that some things that follow, were done before the death of <hi>Isaac,</hi> though heere so closely the return of the one, and the death of the other, do ioyne together.</p>
            <p n="10">10 The Story that doeth properly appertaine to the time of <hi>Iacob,</hi> after that <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saac</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> is now departed, is altogether in a manner, about their going downe into <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt:</hi> but yet, some few other things enterlaced withall. About their going downe into <hi>Aegypt,</hi> wee haue deliuered vnto vs, first howe God prouided for them there; then, how he brought them down vnto it. The prouision that God made for them there, was by the meanes of <hi>Ioseph</hi> the youngest Sonne of <hi>Iacob</hi> but one, whome to that end he sent thither before: very much humbling him first; but then exalting him a great deale more. In the Story of his humiliation, wee haue first set downe the occasion of it, then, the thing it selfe. The occasion of it was diuers: partly of God;
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:7530:63"/> partly of Men. Of God it was, that hee had two such dreames, as did plainely▪ insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate, <note place="margin">Gen. 37, 7 6.</note> that some way or other hee was to be aduanced aboue them all: one, that ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering together sheaues of Corne in the field, his sheafe stoode vpright, and all their sheaues came round about it, and did all bow themselues vnto it: the other, that the Sunne and the Moone, and eleauen Starres, did all bow them themselues vnto him. So farre as it was of Men, it partly came by <hi>Iacob,</hi> and <hi>Ioseph</hi> himselfe: but chiefly; by those brethren of <hi>Ioseph.</hi> It came partly by <hi>Iacob,</hi> because hee loued <hi>Ioseph</hi> more than the rest: partly also by <hi>Ioseph</hi> himselfe, because he was wont to tell his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ather of <note place="margin">Ibid 3. 4.</note> such disorders as were noted in them; and himselfe did tell them how hee had drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. But it came chiefly of them for that their owne loosenes made them so much <note place="margin">Ibid. 2, 5, 6, 10. Ibid. 2. 4, 5, 8, 11.</note> to mislike his telling of them: and because they had in their hearts such enuy against him, that neither could they like, that their Father did then beare more affection to him, than to the rest (insomuch that they could not speake peaceably vnto him: an <note place="margin">Ibid. 4.</note> ordinary fruite, of that naughty roote) nor to heare of those dreames, that seemed to boad such aduancement to him. In the thing it selfe wee are to note, what op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity they had vnto it: then, how themselues did worke thereon. The oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity that they had vnto it, was, that <hi>Iacob</hi> sent him vnto them where they were <note place="margin">Ibid, 12-17.</note> tending their Cattell and Sheepe, very farre from the place where then he lay, to see how they and their Cattle did, and to bring him word thereof. In their woorking <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> on this opportunity wee are to note, that first they intended great mischiefe against him: but then perfourmed it, not altogether with such rigor as first they conceaued. <note place="margin">Ibid. 18. 20.</note> As touching that great mischiefe that at the first they intended against him, it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that so soone as they saw him a good way off, they consulted among themselues of killing him out-right: so to see what his dreames would come vnto. That they did not performe this euill meaning of theirs against him, altogether with that rigor that first they conceiued, it was by the better aduice of some of themselues: but yet notwithstanding, they afterward perfourmed it badly enough. That better aduice that was giuen by some of themselues, was giuen by <hi>Ruben</hi> first: then, by <hi>Iudah. Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ben</hi> was the eldest of them, who before had committed very foule incest; as <hi>Iudah</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 35, 22, 45, 7.</note> also did a while after sinne very fouly: but now they saued the life of him, who after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward saued the liues of them all; besides, that of <hi>Iudah,</hi> Christ also himselfe did after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward come. A good caueat to vs that follow, that no way immoderately we alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether abandon the woorst men of all: not knowing what good in time to come, it may please God to bring forth of them to our vse. So <hi>Ruben</hi> first, perceiuing them to be so deadly bent against him, diswaded them from that cruell fact; and admised them rather to put him into a dry pit there by: hoping by this meanes to deliuer him <note place="margin">Ge 37. 21. 22.</note> out of their handes, and to bring him safe to his Father againe; which aduice of his was by and by followed. For so soone as hee was come vnto them, they stript him of his vpper-most garment, and put him into that dry pit that was by them, there to ende his woefull dayes: themselues neuerthelesse so little touched with any feeling <note place="margin">Ibid. 23-25.</note> thereof, that they presently after sat downe to their meat, as if there were nothing therein to grieue them. Being so set (little regarding the anguish of their Brother now in the pit; or rather, for ought that hee knew to the contrary, or they did meane him, euen in his graue) they espy a sort of Merchaunts comming towardes them, as <note place="margin">Ibid. 25. 32.</note> their way did lye to goe into <hi>Aegypt,</hi> there doeth <hi>Iudah</hi> now come forth with his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice also: namely, that it would be no benefit to them, thus to destroy their brother, though they kept their doings therein so close as they could. His aduice therefore was, to take him foorth of the pit againe, and to sell him to those Merchants: as also they did, (but <hi>Ruben</hi> not beeing priuie vnto it, and much sorrowing for him) for twenty Siccles of siluer (about two shillings and sixe-pence a peece, after the rate of Coyne with vs) nowe to bee a boud-slaue for euer; and there-withall dipping that vpper garment of his in blood, they sent it to their Father as a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken that his Son was like to be slain with some wild beast. Whereupon <hi>Iacob</hi> being so perswaded, did take it very heauily, &amp; could not be comforted: as also his Father <hi>Isaac,</hi> grand-father to <hi>Ioseph,</hi> is noted to haue done; this bad part of those his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phews <note place="margin">Ibid <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

The helpe that God vouchsafed him heere, was not onely, as before, the Iailers fauour: but also, that he endowed him with a speciall gift besides, whereby at length he was deliuered. The fauour of the Iailer was such towardes him (for that he saw the Lord to be with him) that hee also com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted <note place="margin">Ibid. 21-23.</note> the whole charge vnto him. That speciall guift besides wherewith it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed God to endew him, was the interpretation of Dreames: and it pleased God at length to worke his deliuerance thereby, first by making it knowne to the King of <hi>Egypt</hi> that he had such a guift; then, by affoording the vse or benefite of it to him also, not onely to his full contenment, but euen to admiration withall. It was made knowne to the King of <hi>Egypt,</hi> that such a guift was in <hi>Ioseph,</hi> by the relation of one of his principall Officers that did attend him namely, that both he and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">Gen. 40, 1-<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Vnto the King himselfe, was the vse and benefite thereof affoorded likewise, not onely, as I said, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> to his full contentment, but euen to admiration also, when as about two yeares after (all which time the Officer aforesaid had <hi>Ioseph</hi> in very vnthākfull obliuion: belike, that he might be beholding to God alone) it pleased God by a couple of Dreames to trouble the heart of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> also. Now therefore the time being come that he was to be exalted, wee are to note, what was the occasion of it: and how it pleased God thereby to doe it. The occasion was, first those two dreames themselues that now <hi>Pharaoh</hi> had: then also, that himselfe was disquieted with <note place="margin">Ge. 41, 1-8.</note> them; and could get none that could shew him the meaning of them. This occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on being giuen, now it pleased God so to worke thereon, that <hi>Ioseph</hi> was sent for, his prison-garments taken from him and others put-on, and so set before <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> to expound those his Dreames vnto him. Vnto whom when hee had expounded <note place="margin">Ibid. 14-32.</note> them, namely, that those seauen faier and wel-liking Kine, and those seauen eares of corne that were large and full, which first appeared, did betoken seauen yeares very fruitfull, which immediately after the Land should enioy, and that those o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther seauen leane Kine that deuoured the fat, and that those other seauen eares that were so thinne, and likewise deuoured the better, and yet neyther of them both were (to see too) the better for it, did signifie other seauen yeares of dearth to follow the former, which should consume all the ouerplus of the others, and yet be little the beter for it, also that the same should certainely and presently be done; <note place="margin">Ibid. 33-36. Ibid, 37-46.</note> and therewithall aduised him what to doe: the King by and by, conceiuing well of his interpretation, and aduise withall, and not thinking to finde any other so meete as <hi>Ioseph</hi> himselfe to preforme that charge, made him chiefe next vnder
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:7530:64"/> him in all his Kingdom, changed his name, and bestowed an honourable marriage on him, when hee was now full thirty yeares old. <hi>Ioseph</hi> likewise, according to <note place="margin">Ibid. 46. 49.</note> the authority and trust to him committed, did very carefully gather together, and laid vp in the Citties of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> whatsoeuer might bee spared of those plentifull years to haue it in a readinesse, against the time that neede should require to bring it forth. But in those his doings, two thinges there are of speciall note: one, in what sort by this occasion hee dealt withall the Land of <hi>Aegypt;</hi> the other, howe fauourable he was to certaine of them. Dealing so as he did with the whole land <note place="margin">Ibid. 47. 13-21</note> of <hi>Aegipt;</hi> first, getting vp all their Money, then their Cattle, thirdly their landes and themselues too, to bee the proper goods of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> the King, and vtterly to extinguish all opinion of propriety in any thing they had, translating them al from one Citty to another, and then ordaining the fift part of their increase to be a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall rent or tribute vnto the King for such lands as they had returned to them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine; though, whether for the wisedome or equity of the deuise, or for the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of his person, it bee fauourably interpreted of many: yet for my part, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not see, but that hee inclined too much to the benefite of the King, and regarded the people too little; though yet notwithstanding the deciding of it might best <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> be performed, by such as haue the best in-sight into the whole. How fauourable he was to certaine of them, appeareth in this, that of all others their Landes were spared, and themselues specially respected by such order as the King had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. But who these were, is a question with some now: the generall opinion of <note place="margin">Ibid. 22.</note> most men beeing, that they were the Priestes; some others of late, that they were <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Tremel.</hi> and <hi>Iunius.</hi>
               </note> certaine Officers or Deputies of the Kings. The word indeede doth signify both: but not onely the <hi>Aegiptians</hi> especially, but all other Heathen peoples also, much after the same manner did make speciall reckoning of their Priest-hoodes, and vouchsafed them great immunities aboue others; and not vnlikely, but that the Kings speciall Officers were otherwaies prouided for by the King himselfe. Again, such Officers were euer lightly but personall, and went not as Lands did, from the Father vnto the Childe; but to such as were thought the meetest for them: and then could there be no landes of such so like to be priuiledged as the Landes of the Priestes; vnlesse for such also there were a perpetuall or standing maintenance set forth (which is not so likely) as for the Priest-hoode was wont to bee. The onely obiection is, that it is not likely, that <hi>Ioseph</hi> would be so carefull for that Idolatrous Priest-hood of theirs. But that perswasion of his knowledge and zeale on that behalfe is but presumed, without any warrant in the word for the same: and, if the <hi>Aegiptians</hi> had that speciall regard to their Priest-hood, as the Stories doe witnesse they had, he could not be in that authority and credite with them, vnlesse hee also did in all such speciall matters hold-on the selfe-same course with them. So that it seemeth as the iudgement of the most part of the learned is, that they were the Priestes, and not other Officers that so were spared: and to me besides, that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as <hi>Iunius</hi> ioyned with <hi>Tremellius</hi> in that translation, that note should seeme rather to come from <hi>Iunius,</hi> who diuers times sheweth himselfe to bee some-what out of temper in such matters; then from <hi>Tremellius,</hi> whom I doe not otherwise find, but to bee of the better iudgement. But as the word dooth signifie both, so if they would haue taken in these as well as the others, wee would not much sticke with them then: but if they will needes so vnkindly exclude them altogether, then they giue vs occasion to examine their iudgement; and as not able to abide the tryall, to returne it to them againe. In his bringing of them downe to this prouision that before hee made for them, wee are to consider: first, howe they were occasioned vnto it: then, how they were themselues brought downe. Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casioned they were; first, by strict necessity, to seeke to that Countrey for helpe: then, by it and other motiues besides, much better then it, themselues to goe thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, there to inhabite. Of strickt necessity, they were occasioned to seeke to that Countrey for helpe, twice: first, onely for victuals; then, not onely for them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, but now also to redeeme one of their Bretheren that lay in prison. In theyr first iourney when they went downe for victuals onely, we are to note the occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
               <pb n="106" facs="tcp:7530:65"/> of it: and what successe it was they had there. The occasion of it was, that there was so great a famine in all those Countries adioyning: and that they heard <note place="margin">Gen. 41, 57, 42: 1, 2.</note> withall, that there was Corne to bee had in <hi>Aegypt.</hi> The successe that they had there, was part of it good: but some part of it hard likewise. Good it was, that there they got Corne to relieue their family withall: and had all their money that <note place="margin">Ibid. 3-36.</note> they had payde for it, giuen them into their sackes backe againe with them, they knew not how. It was partly hard likewise, for that they were by so great a man as <hi>Ioseph</hi> then was there, charged all to be spyes, roughly for a time handled in word and deede: and one of them besides kept in prison as pledge, for a matter that hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly might be performed. In their second iourney when they were to goe and get their Brother to be deliuered besides, we are to note, first how hardly the same was obtained of <hi>Iacob:</hi> then what successe they had therein also. In that <hi>Iacob</hi> was so loath to let <hi>Beniamin</hi> go with them, vntill by extreame want he was driuen vnto <note place="margin">Ibid. 36-38. &amp; 43, 1-10.</note> it (by which they were for all that time hindered of this other iourney) there is one thing to be noted very apparant: another also that may be doubted. That which is apparant; is, that he bare a speciall great loue to <hi>Beniamin,</hi> when as the imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his other Sonne <hi>Simeon</hi> could not worke so effectually with him, till he was by famine also vrged vnto it▪ an example of the great loue that parents oft-times do beare to their children; and a good inducement to all the Children of God, to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure themselues of far greater there by many degrees. That which may be doubted, is, that it may seeme his faith towards God, was not now so strong, when as notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing all those promises of God towards him, and many great proofes thereof besides, he yet doubteth such perrill in sending <hi>Beniamin</hi> with his other Bretheren. For the successe thereof we are for part of it first to begin at the land of <hi>Canaan:</hi> then to go downe into the Land of <hi>Aegypt</hi> for the rest. That part of the successe that <note place="margin">Ibid. 11-15.</note> we finde in the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> was altogether good: Namely, that first they got their Father to like of it, and to yeelde his consent thereunto; then that hee sent them away in so good manner, both with a present of the best things the Countrey yeelded, and well furnished with money also, with double to that they had before to make their prouision, and with that which they found in the mouth of their sackes besides. That other part of it that wee finde in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> was first but moderate: but soone after farre exeeeding. That part of it that was moderate, did withall very comfortably encline vnto good. For they had their brother at the first brought out of prison, and restored vnto them againe: and had very good, honourable and <note place="margin">Ibid. 16. 34.</note> kinde entertainement besides. That which soone after farre exceeded, was first exceeding heauy and greeuous vnto them: but immediately after as ioyfull also. That which so farre exceeded in heauinesse and griefe vnto them was, that they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> were no sooner dismissed with their Corne out of the Citty, but that the chiefe Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler of <hi>Iosephs</hi> house did hotly pursue them, and charged them to be very bad men, that notwithstanding their good vsage, had now stolne away with them a principal <note place="margin">Gen. 44, 1-34</note> peece of his Maisters plate: and finding the same with one of them to the vtter dismaying of them all (as indeede they were guiltlesse of it) brought them all back againe into the Citty, there to abide such punishment and shame, as to such a fact was due. And that worse was, it light chiefely on him, on whom it might worst of them all: namely on <hi>Beniamin</hi> his Fathers darling; and with whom hee was so loath to haue parted. <hi>Ioseph</hi> belike for the affection he bare him, was desirous to retaine him longer with him; &amp; great men stick not ofttimes, without any suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent cause to charge their inferiors as themselues think good: but true and iust dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling is euer the best; and in it we euer haue meanes enow, to accomplish whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer is meete to be had. And Seruants in such case are for the most part readye enough to doe as their Maisters prescribe vnto them: as heere we may see an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample in this one, boldly charging them with Theft (because his Maister had so commanded) whom him-selfe did certainly know to be cleare of it. But while they were in this heauy pickle, then commeth in that, which as farre exceeded in ioy: most of all, and first from <hi>Ioseph;</hi> but then also, in part from <hi>Pharaoh.</hi> As <note place="margin">

<pb n="107" facs="tcp:7530:65"/> will needs breake foorth. He tolde them plainly who hee was: his teares also plentifully witnessing his Brotherly and tender affection towards them. He bad them not be dismayed, that they solde him to be a bond-man, for that is was not they but God that in his prouidence thus sent him before them, to prouide for thē against this time of famine, that so they might liue and not dye. He tolde them, that yet there were fiue years more thereof to come: willed them to hasten home to their father, to tell him of these things, and to entreat him to come ouer vnto him, he and all his family to dwell there; that so dooing he should be placed in the best part of all <hi>Egipt:</hi> and withall loaded them home with prouision and Chariots, both for him-selfe and all his family. That which came from <hi>Pharaoh</hi> the King, was to <note place="margin">Ibid. 16-20.</note> the same end: him-selfe also desiring, that <hi>Iacob</hi> and all his family would come thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and to that end, both offering vnto him the best of the land of <hi>Egypt</hi> to dwel in when he should come, and in the meane season commanding <hi>Ioseph</hi> to send him prouision and Chariots to fetch him. How by this famine yet enduring, and by other good motiues besides, <hi>Iacob</hi> and his company were occasioned to go downe into <hi>Egypt</hi> there to dwell, will now soone appeare: first, by relation of those his Sonnes when they returned; then by those thinges that now they brought with them. They tolde him that <hi>Ioseph</hi> his Sonne was yet aliue, and now the chiefe <note place="margin">Ibid. 25-26.</note> Lord in all <hi>Egypt</hi> vnder the King: and withall did the residue of their ioyfull mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage vnto him. Himselfe also did see and behold the prouision, presents, &amp; Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riots that to that end were sent vnto him.

Beeing thus occasioned, and thereupon resolued now to take his iourney thither, he commeth from <hi>Hebron</hi> first to <hi>Beersheba:</hi> and then into <hi>Egypt.</hi> In <hi>Beersheba,</hi> the first part of his iourney, and about twenty miles to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <note place="margin">Adriconi in Bersabe.</note>
               <hi>Egypt,</hi> there we read, that himselfe sought vnto God: and that God did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably appeare vnto him. He sought vnto the Lord there, by offering vnto him certaine Sacrifices: which, it may seeme, were, either of thankefulnesse, that <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 46, 1,</note> his Sonne, was yet liuing; or to obtaine the goodnesse of God towardes him and his, in this his iourney. God likewise appeared comfortably vnto him, in that first telling him who he was, euen that mighty God the God of his father, he then bad him not to feare that his going downe into <hi>Egypt,</hi> for that there he would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease <note place="margin">Ibid. 2-4.</note> him to a mighty people, and himselfe go downe and come vp with him: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so that <hi>Ioseph</hi> that was supposed to be dead, should close vp his eyes at his death. Thence proceeding in his iourney towardes <hi>Egypt,</hi> we haue deliuered vnto vs, how he finished his iourney thither: and in what estate there hee afterward liued. His iourney thither may we account then to be finished, when as soone after his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming into the Countrey he had doue his dutie first to the King, and then was dismis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed of him to his owne where he was to dwell. In which compasse of time we haue no more but these two: First, how he met with <hi>Ioseph</hi> his Sonne; then how he came to the presence of the King. For the former it is noted, that going on his iourney <note place="margin">Ibid. 5-30.</note> from <hi>Beersheba,</hi> he and all his company and possessions with him, threescore and sixe persons of lineall descent from him proceeding, (himselfe, <hi>Ioseph</hi> and his two sonnes that were in <hi>Egypt</hi> alreadie, making vp the number of threescore and ten) comming belike some-what towards his iourneyes end, or when hee saw the time to be mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test, sent <hi>Iudah</hi> before vnto <hi>Ioseph,</hi> to aduertise him of his comming, and to acquaint him with his iourney. Whereuppon <hi>Ioseph</hi> addressed himselfe to come and meete his Father <hi>Israel:</hi> and when he came so neere that his Father might discerne him to be the same indeede, he then made his father a glad man of him. For his comming into the Kings presence, <hi>Ioseph</hi> would first go to aduertise the King of his comming, and belike to know his pleasure withall: but first, he aduised his brethren and all the <note place="margin">Ibid. 31-34.</note> company, if <hi>Pharaoh</hi> should aske them what trade of life they had vsed, plainely to acknowledge the truth indeede, that they had vsed none other but onely to reare and tend Cattle; that so they might the rather haue the land of <hi>Goshen</hi> for them to
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:7530:66"/> dwell in. For besides that the land it selfe was meete to such a purpose, it lay at an out-side of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and next vnto the land of <hi>Canaan:</hi> and so the meetest for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> them in those respects; especially, when as the <hi>Egyptians</hi> had withall a speciall dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like of that kinde of life, and of those that vsed the same. They being thus ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monished, <hi>Ioseph</hi> tooke with him fiue of his Brethren, and went to the King, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertising <note place="margin">Gen. 47, 1, 6.</note> him, that his Father and Brethren, and all their family, together with all their goodes and Cattle, were now come thither, there to soiourne: themselues also then entreating, and the King condiscending thereunto, and giuing charge that it might be effected, that they might haue the land of <hi>Goshen</hi> wherein to so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iourne. After which, he brought his Father also before <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> who shortlie after (in respect of his age as it seemeth) dismist him againe, to repose himselfe to <note place="margin">Ibid, 7-10.</note> his owne best ease: being at that time, as himselfe acknowledged to <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> one hundred and thirty yeares olde. Their iourney being in this soft finished, in what estate he there afterward liued, wee haue set downe but generally: but withall some particulars more specially mentioned. Generally, we may conceiue, that he liued in good case there, being so welcome to the King as he was, and hauing so able and so carefull a man to prouide for him there, as then his Sonne <hi>Ioseph</hi> was: and it is plainely set downe, both that they were placed in that good and <note place="margin">Ibid. 11, 12, 27</note> fruitfull corner of the land; and that <hi>Iosephs</hi> care and prouiding for them was, as if, like a Mother or Nurse, he should put the meate, as if they were children euen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their mouths. Those particulars that are more specially set downe, are such things as went a little before his death: and then how long he liued there. Those things that went a little before his death, were three: one, before that yet he sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; other two, when now he was sicke already. Before that yet hee sickned, <note place="margin">Ibid. 19-31.</note> he called for his Sonne <hi>Ioseph,</hi> and required him to sweare (a sufficient Token to shew, how earnestly he was bent to haue the same performed indeede) that when God should call him, he should not bury him in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> but where his elders were buried before: and when <hi>Ioseph</hi> had giuen his Oath, that so he would, he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon worshipped, as hauing obtained a speciall good fauour therein. Whereby it seemeth, that hee did both professe his faith in those promises of God that his seede should inherit that land; and stirre vp his posterity also, not to fasten their affection to <hi>Aegypt,</hi> but to haue the promised Land in continuall desire and expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. When now he was sicke already, he deliuered many thinges, as in the way o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> a blessing or prophetically, that should afterward be accomplished, or come to passe in those his children: and first, to <hi>Ioseph,</hi> who purposely at that time came vnto him; then, to all the others besides, whom to that end himselfe did call for. Vnto <hi>Ioseph</hi> he deliuered, what God had promised concerning the Land of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 48, 1-22.</note> to be the inheritance of his posterity; and then withall, tooke in those two Sonnes of his which then he had, into the estate and number of his owne, as if they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> had beene begotten by him: and when <hi>Ioseph</hi> did then bring them vnto his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that his Father might to that end lay his hands vppon them, he did so also; but not in such order as <hi>Ioseph</hi> had thought that he would, but preferring <hi>Ephraim</hi> the younger, before <hi>Manasses</hi> the elder. In taking of whom into his number, it may seeme, that there was respect had (if not by <hi>Iacob,</hi> yet by God himselfe, who directed the action) vnto those sufferings of <hi>Ioseph</hi> first; and to his good deserts after: it may be also, to the wrong done vnto <hi>Rachell,</hi> when her Sister was prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red before her; and to make some supply, in that she was nothing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o fruitfull as her Sister was.

            <p n="11">11 <hi>Ioseph</hi> was brought into this Land, as we heard before when hee was but young; and hitherto whatsoeuer Story we had of him, it all came within the time of his Father <hi>Iacob:</hi> since whose departure we haue little remaining of him. But that which we haue, we may as I take it, thus best distinguish: first, that we marke what thinges wee haue of him recorded; then also that wee note, that one thing there is, that we read not of him. Those that are of him recorded, do partly respect others: and partly himselfe. Those others whom part of his doings doe most respect, are, his Father deceased: and his Bretheren remaining. As touching his Father decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, both for the time present he imbawmed him, and mourned for him, as the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner <note place="margin">Gen. 50: 1-3.</note> of the Countrey was: and shortly after, when that solemnity was finished, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> leaue first of the King, to goe and bury him in the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> hee very <note place="margin">Ibid. 5-14.</note> honourably performed the same.

                  </gap>.</note> done it; and promising on his part, to haue that care of them and theirs, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they might see, that he retained no displeasure towards them. Himselfe it concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, first that during his time among them, as himself had promised, so it seemeth by that which followed immediatly after, for that they encreased so fast as they did, that <note place="margin">Exod. 1: 7.</note> for his time he had a speciall regard to them indeede: then that when he waxed old, and saw that now he must shortly dye, he also made the chiefe of his Family or Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to sweare, that when God in time to come, should visit them, and haue them <note place="margin">Ge. 50: 24, 25</note> thence vnto the Countrey, that hee had promised their Fathers to giue them, then should they take his bones with them also. And so hauing long dwelt in good estate in the Land, hauing also seene his Childrens Children, and being nowe of the age of one hundred and ten yeares, he also dyed: and as the manner of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey <note place="margin">Ibid. 22, 23, 26</note> was, his body was imbawmed; and yet not buryed, but chested onely. That one thing that I thought was good to note, that it is not mentioned of him, is, that now before his death, he did not offer to blesse any of the people according to their Tribes, as his Father had done before: nor so much as his owne Children neyther. <hi>Abraham</hi> had certaine speciall blessings to bee deriued to some part of his posteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; such I meane as shold descend from <hi>Isaac:</hi> and of those some of them belonged to all that company; and one, but vnto one portion of them. Those that belonged to all that company, were two: one, that they should bee his peculiar people; the other, that they should inhabite the Land of <hi>Canaan.</hi> That which belonged but to one portion of them onelie, was, that of them should come the promised Seede. All which had <hi>Isaac</hi> likewise, to such as shoulde descend from him by <hi>Iacob. Iacob</hi> had no such limitation, for the two former of them, from any of all his Sonnes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scending of him; and therefore, though hee had twelue in all, yet from that recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning doth hee exclude not one of them all: but for the other he had, and therefore did he as it were appropriate that (as by God he was directed) vnto the Tribe of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah</hi> onely. <hi>Abraham</hi> therefore, being made acquainted with Gods purpose there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, though we read not, that hee vsed any set forme of confirming or establishing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
               <pb n="110" facs="tcp:7530:67"/> those blessings to <hi>Isaac</hi> (which notwithstanding he might if he would:) yet he took such a course as tended thereunto, when hee sent away <hi>Ismael</hi> first, and afterward his other Children also with their portions; and left vnto <hi>Isaac</hi> onely, both all his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance to speake of; and there to soiourne. But <hi>Isaac</hi> was desirous (as well hee might) to vse some set manner to confirme those blessings to one of his Sonnes: but therein so fast bound with the Bias of the most vsuall or ordinary course, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he had gone cleane wrong, had not God preuented him of his meaning therein, turning it aright to him that should heue it, though himselfe did neuer meane it vnto him. <hi>Iacob</hi> also hauing many, &amp; finding the two former to belong to thē all, seemeth secure of that matter: and therefore purposing, in some set manner also to bestowe some blessing on them all, he doth no more but giue them such admoniton or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, as in the Spirite of Prophecy (wherewith then he was endewed) he thought to be most meetest for them. But then comming to the other, that doth he leaue vnto the Tribe of <hi>Iudah</hi> onely. After which time we doe not read, that eyther <hi>Ioseph</hi> or <hi>Iudah</hi> (which notwithstanding were principall Men; and then much lesse is any such thing to be looked for of others that followed) did vse any such set form of blessing: or directed their children to look for any such thing at their hands. Sauing that <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi> but not as their Father (for he was but one person of one of those twelue Tribes himselfe) but as endewed with a principall Spirite, vttereth much like to the most of them, as <hi>Iacob</hi> had done before to them all. But afterward God directed the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery <note place="margin">Num. 6: 22-27</note> that he then ordained, how in some set manner to blesse the people. Nowe if the case so were, that they had any such custome among them, to direct their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to aske them blessing, whether the example of the former, or prescript of the latter had beene more auaileable, would then belike haue beene examined, and so for that matter haue left vs better light, then many of vs (it seemeth) haue light on as yet: whereby then also might better bee seene, whether those many Christian Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, that vse it not, should not draw vnto them that which doth vse it; or that one, that onely doth vse it, doth therein lead the way any better, then those that do not.</p>

            <p n="1">1 <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hese Fathers aforesaide, and so many as were of them descended, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> beeing yet free, now begin to grow into bondage. Concerning which, whereas it pleased God afterward to deliuer them thence, wee are first to consider of that their bondage: then, how it pleased God to deliuer them from it. In that their bondage wee are to consider in what sort they came into it: and then, what was their estate therein. In what sort they came into it, we are therefore the rather to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> that so we may the better see, by what right it was that nowe they were in that estate: whether themselues had so deserued; or whether vniustly it was imposed vpon them. If themselues had so deserued, then must it bee, eyther by some fault of theirs: or else by their folly. That it was by no fault of theirs, whereby they had trespassed against the <hi>Aegiptians,</hi> the matter is cleere, for that they were another people, of another Countrey; such as neuer had any dealing with them, and were altogether vnknowne vnto them: and so farre, all manner of wayes, from deseruing ill at their handes, as that on the other side, by one of their company, they had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued maruellous well. That it might be their folly, might of the two bee rather conceiued, for that themselues came downe thither, there to inhabite, among a mightier people then they: and, that more is, much sundered from them, partly in their manner and Trade of liuing; but especially in their Religion. Neuerthelesse, in this also they are thorovghly cleered: partly by the Nature of their case; and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by good warrant besides. In the Nature of their case wee finde; first, that they were driuen thither by strict necessity: then, that they had a speciall friend there also
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:7530:67"/> besides. The warrant that otherwise they had, was partly from beneath: but chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from aboue. That which was but from beneath, was neuerthelesse the word of a Prince; then the which there is not lightly any security greater on earth: and yet was that farther strengthened besides, euen by those great desertes of <hi>Ioseph,</hi> both vnto the whole Land of <hi>Aegipt;</hi> and especially, to the Dignity and Coffers of the Princes themselues. That which was from aboue, was the authority of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe; both encouraging the leader of them, not to feare to remooue thither; and telling him withall, that himselfe would goe downe with him thither, and afterward <note place="margin">Gen. 46, 3, 4.</note> bring him thence also againe. So it remaineth, that it was vniustly imposed vppon them: a sufficient patterne to shewe vnto all, what curtesie the Children of GOD, whatsoeuer their deserts may bee, may at any time looke for at the handes of the World. What was their estate therein, that we may the better finde, we haue neede to consider; first, what is was by the mallice of Man: then, what it was by the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of God. What it was by the mallice of Man, wee are to gather out of the ill dealing that was vsed towardes them: and out of the time that it continued. The ill dealing that was offered vnto them, was, partly before there was motion made for their deliuerance: and partly after. In that which was before, wee are to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, what it was: and, whereuppon it was that so they were dealt with, what it was is plainely enough declared, both for the substance of it: and for the manner of their proceeding therein. The substance of it was, to diminish and lessen the people of <note place="margin">Exod. 1, 8. 16.</note>
               <hi>Israell,</hi> whom now they saw to grow so fast vpon them: and to obtaine their purpose therein, not to spare any oppression or death it selfe, that themselues should thinke needefull to such a purpose. Their manner of proceeding therein, was first such as might haue some other pretence to shaddowe their doing: then, such as bare none <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> other face, but plainely shewed it selfe what it was. That which might haue some other pretence to shaddow their doings, was, that their oppression of them with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate labour: wherein notwithstanding they might seeme to haue none other meaning, but onely to haue their owne businesse doone. That which bare none otherface, but plainely shewed it selfe what it was, was that cruell course of theyrs, to destroy their Men-Children so soone as they were borne: which neuerthelesse for a time walked more secret; but afterward shunned not the open light neyther. It walked more secret, when vnder-hand they would haue had the Mid-wiues to haue <note place="margin">Ibid. 15, 16. Ibid. 17-22.</note> done it. It shunned not the open light, whē as God so wrought with those Midwiues, that they would not be the Instruments of so barbarous cruelty: taking order then, openly to doe it howsoeuer. That whereupon they so dealt with them, rested on <note place="margin">Ibid. 7. Ibid. 8-10.</note> two principall branches: one, that they multiplyed or grewe so very fast; the other, that the <hi>Aegiptians</hi> themselues began now to conceiue some feare of them. That ill dealing that they had after that motion, was made for their deliuerance, was no <note place="margin">Exod. 5, 4-18</note> more but the exacting of much more of that seruile labour of them then before, and that cleane beyond all reason: and sharpe punnishment notwithstanding when they did it not, though farre aboue their ability to doe; nor any thing holpen therein by <hi>Pharaoh</hi> when they complained thereof vnto him. The time that this theyr misery continued, is not certainely knowne: but we haue good Story of it, for aboue the space of fourescore yeares. For it was begun before <hi>Moses</hi> was borne: and <note place="margin">Exo. 1: 2. 2: 1, 2</note> himselfe was fourescore yeares old, when first it pleased God to set in hand with their deliuerance by him. A good patterne to shew, how needefull a thing patience is for <note place="margin">Acts 7, 23, 30.</note> the Children of God: and that in the best of vs all there is more euill then wee are aware of. For if God doe vse oft-times to put his Children to so great sufferinges heere, and for so long a time together, and none of vs all may account our selues ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from it, then neede we all to be prouided: and that cannot be, but onely by some rare and speciall good patience. Againe, because God is wise and gratious, and in his wisedome best knoweth what measure of such exercise we all doe neede, and in his goodnesse will not afflict vs farther than for our good is needfull for vs: hence may we gather, that the euill that is in vs (euen in the best of vs all) is maruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous great, when God findeth so great afflictions so needfull for vs. What it was by the goodnesse of God, we haue it two principall pointes declared: one, while as yet
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:7530:68"/> hee suffered not the <hi>Aegiptians</hi> so farre to execute their malice against them; the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, when he did let them loose vnto it. He suffered them not to doe it, when as hee so wrought with those Grace-Women or Mid-Wiues, that they woulde <note place="margin">Exo. 1, 17, 20.</note> rather disobey the King (excuse it as they could) than commit so barbarous crueltie on filly Infants; and in that for so doing he blessed them for it, it sheweth howe well it pleased him, that so they did. He did let them loose vnto it, when as their malice now did so farre obtaine, that at their pleasure they might drowne in their Riuers all <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
               <note place="margin">Ibid. 22.</note> the Men-Children of the <hi>Israelites,</hi> from time to time as they should be borne. But euen then also did he shew his goodnesse towardes them, both in that he did neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse <note place="margin">Ibid, 7. 20.</note> so much increase them: and besides, that in that their distresse, he gaue them the harts to seeke his fauour, and to bemone their case vnto him; and himselfe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <note place="margin">Ibid. 23. 24. Ibid. 25.</note> did in gracious manner consider vppon them. A good assurance to vs also, that it is of the speciall fauour of God, if eyther he so vphold vs, when any way wee are assaulted: or giue vs an heart, in the time of our affliction, to seeke vnto God, and to intreat his fauour towards vs.</p>
            <p n="2">2 How it pleased God to deliuer them from that their bondage, to the end that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> we may the better finde, wee are to consider; first, in what manner hee wrought it: then, how in the end it was effected. In his manner of working it, wee are also to note; first, how he prouided the parties by whom he would doe it: then, how hee set in hand with the woorke it selfe. The parties were two, <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theren: <hi>Moses</hi> beeing the younger, but the principall party in this businesse; <hi>Aaron</hi> beeing the elder, but not comming in to this, but by occasion. In <hi>Moses</hi> the cheese and principall party, wee are to marke, first howe hee did preserue him from death: then, how he did farther frame him vnto the businesse that afterward he had to doe for him. Hee preserued him from death, in that beeing at that time borne, when the Male-Children (by the Kinges Commaundement) were so busily sought out to be destroyed, he neuerthelesse gaue the heart (at least) to one of his Parents, to endeuour to keepe him so long as they could: and then himselfe prouided other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise for him. That which his Parents (or at least his Mother) did for him, was, that he was secretly kept within by them, for three months: and then laid forth in a Bas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket (prouided for the purpose) in the side of a Riuer, among the Flagges, Bul-rushes, <note place="margin">Exod. 2, 14</note> or such like, growing there, leauing his Sister a good pretty distance off, to haue an eye vnto him. That which himselfe prouided otherwise for him, was, that <hi>Phara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ohs</hi> Daughter, comming that way by other occasion, should finde the Childe, and take it for her owne: and so by her fauour giue it protection and safety from death; and yet notwithstanding (though vnwitting to her) leaue it with the Mother to be Nuiced for her. How he did farther frame him vnto the businesse that afterward he had to doe for him, we haue set downe briefely (and so farre as is sufficient) in the word of God: but else-where also, in some few points, more specially. That which wee haue set downe in the word of GOD, is part of it in the Originall Story: and part againe, in the recitall of it after. In the originall Story we haue no more (that we may certainely gather thereon) but onely that he was afterward brought to <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raohs</hi> Daughter, and was as her Sonne: and that after it, in processe of time, he was endewed with a minde, desirous to see how his Bretheren did vnder their burthens; <note place="margin">Ibid. 11-22.</note> and that he could not well abide, eyther any iuiury done vnto them by the <hi>Aegypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> or disorderly dealing among themselues: but that after that, God did humble him a long time after, putting a feare into his heart, to get himselfe thence to saue his life, which now was in danger for the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> which he had slaine: &amp; thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forward to become a Sheepheard to another in a strange land for a long time after. Both which were good praeparatiues vnto that businesse: such an inclination vnto his Bretheren, the better to regard their hard estate when afterward he should be imploi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to helpe them therein; his humiliation, to be a needfull checke vnto him, for at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting it with blood so inordinately before the time, and (as it seemeth) in confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the earthly credit and reckoning that then he was in, God meaning another course, and more to the aduancement of his glory therein. In the recitall of this
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:7530:68"/> Story after, by Saint <hi>Stephen</hi> in that his Apology, and by the Apostle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> we haue further deliuered vnto vs, both that hee was some-what farther furnished: and the precise time of certaine principall matters therein. His farther furniture is noted to be; first, that he had education in his youth, that being come to mans state, <note place="margin">Acts. 7. 22.</note> he was learned in all the wisedome of the <hi>Aegyptians;</hi> and was mighty in word and deede: and that that going forth to visite his bretheren, was not of an ordinary de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire onely, as wishing them well, but of a speciall zeale, refusing to be accounted the Sonne of <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Daughter, chusing rather to suffer aduersitie with the people <note place="margin">He. 11, 24-26.</note> of God, then to enioy the pleasures of sinne for a season, and esteeming the rebuke of Christ greater riches than the Treasures of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> hauing respect vnto the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence that in sayth he saw afterward to follow. Those principall matters in the Story, which haue heere their precise time annexed vnto them, are two: one, his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> at what time he is sayde to bee forty yeares olde; the other, <note place="margin">A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> 7, 13, 30.</note> how long hee aboad in seruice and keeping of Sheepe, which is noted to bee forty yeares more. That which else-where we haue noted in some pointes more special<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, is no more but certaine of that which <hi>Iosephus</hi> noteth of him, not disagreeing from the Scripture it selfe: but farther explaning or opening the same. For first, as touching his education, he saith that it was as carefully and as throughly performed, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Antiq. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 5.</note> as they were able: as like enough then, when he was most likely of all others besides, to succeede the King in his Kingdome, the Kinges Daughter hauing already adopted him to be hers, and she hauing no Children of her owne. Then, for his greatnesse besides, that the <hi>Ethiopians</hi> ouer-running the Land of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> were directed, and themselues thought good to make him the Generall of their Army a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them. Who beeing so appointed, and perceiuing that the enemies suspected no daunger from the Wildernesse towardes them, because it was ful of Serpents and venomous Creatures, by a pollicy came that way vpon them with all their forces at vnawares, and so giuing them a great ouerthrow there, and pursuing his victory into their owne Countrey also, hee so deliuered the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> from their tyrrany, and set them free from them againe. Whereby hee became so great and famous a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, that the King himselfe hauing him in iealousie also, they accused him of that slaughter of the <hi>Aegyptian,</hi> and meant so to haue put him to death, but that hee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> in time got from them before. And because the Apostle saith, that hee preferred the <note place="margin">Heb. 11, 26.</note> rebuke of Christ, before the treasures of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> it appeareth thereby, that some way or other he was in the way of good possibility or likehood rather, in time to come to enioy those treasures, in the course that then he was in: and so are these Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories of him the more they make for this point, so much the more to be regarded of vs; as opening vnto vs in particular, that which the Apostle doth set downe but generally.</p>
            <p n="3">3. How he set in hand with the worke it selfe of their deliuerance, to the end <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> that we may the better finde, we are to note, first what passed betwixt God and <hi>Moses</hi> about that matter: then what passed betwixt those whom it pleased God to vse in that businesse, and those with whom they were to deale therein. In that which passed betwixt God and <hi>Moses</hi> about that matter, we are to consider, first in what sort to that end he appeared vnto him: then, how hee dealt with him in the businesse it selfe. In that his appearing, we are in like sort to note, first what hee did of himselfe: then, what he did farther, by such occasion as <hi>Moses</hi> gaue him. Of himselfe he appeared, in a bush, all on fire; and yet nothing at all consumed: a verie fit manner of appearing in respect of the businesse that then was in hand. For it may be probably thought, that <hi>Moses,</hi> if not at that present, yet verie often was carefull on behalfe of the people, who now had beene so long so hardly dealt with <note place="margin">Exod. 3, 1, 2</note> by the <hi>Aegyptians:</hi> and God doth now so appeare vnto him about their deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, that euen out of it <hi>Moses</hi> might gather, that although they were hardlye dealt with; yet were they not thereby diminished. A Bush also is fuller of bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and twigges for the bignesse of it, than most part of Trees are: and so, in that respect too, so much the f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="3 letters">

<pb n="114" facs="tcp:7530:69"/> so exceedingly multiply, as shortly after it did appeare. In that which farther he did by such occasion as <hi>Moses</hi> gaue him, we are first to marke what occasion it was that he did giue him: then, what it was that he did thereupon. The occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion that <hi>Moses</hi> gaue him, was, that he began to draw neere, to see what the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was: and it is both wisedome and duty for vs all (when God doth represent <note place="margin">Ibid. 3.</note> them vnto vs) to haue a good eye to all the workes of God, and to see what wee may gather to our owne edifying out of the same. That which God did heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, rested in two principall points: first, directing him how to behaue himselfe there; then giuing vnto him his reason why. He directed him, not to approach <note place="margin">Ibid 4-6.</note> ouer neere; and to put off the shooes from his seete: so stirring him vp to a speciall reuerence of that presence; and with the inward reuerence of the heart, to ioyne the outward vsage withall. The reason that he gaue him why, was, because the ground whereon he stoode, was at that time holy, for that himselfe by his presence did sanctifie it then; and to that end (and withal to make a way to that which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed) <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> he tolde him that he was the God of his Father, the God of <hi>Abraham,</hi> the God of <hi>Isaac,</hi> and the God of <hi>Iacob:</hi> whereat <hi>Moses</hi> hiding his face, may teach vs also, highly to reuerence his presence in all our assemblies; and, if he hid his face from his countenance onely, then that we should not curiously (or malapartly ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) search out his secrets. As touching the businesse it selfe for the which now he appeared vnto him, it was to let him vnderstand, that now hee meant to set in hand with the deliuerance of the people of <hi>Israel,</hi> and that he would vse his seruice therein. Which he did no sooner impart vnto <hi>Mrses,</hi> but that presently hee shrunke from it (himselfe to be any dealer in it) all that he could. So that there was much businesse with him before that he could be perswaded to meddle with it. So are we to note, first how God did now impart his purpose vnto him: then, with what difficulty <hi>Moses</hi> at length yeelded vnto it. The purpose of God, which now it pleased him to impart vnto <hi>Moses</hi> rested in two principall points: one, that now he meant their deliuerance; the other, that hee would do it by <hi>Moses.</hi> As <note place="margin">Ibid, 7, 8.</note> touching the former, first he telleth him, that he is not ignorant how ill they haue beene dealt with there: then, that now he is come downe to helpe them; and to bring them thence, into a speciall good Land to dwell in. As touching the latter, he first repeateth the former member to him againe: and then telleth him, that he <note place="margin">Ibid. 9, 10.</note> resolued on him to do it. With what difficulty <hi>Moses</hi> at length yeelded vnto it, to the end that we may the better finde, we are first to note, what businesse there was in the meane season: then, how he was in the end resolued. The busines that was in the meane season, was that <hi>Moses</hi> alledged so many difficulties: and that the Lord was faine to satisfie him in euery one. So are we to see, what are the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties that he alledgeth: and how the Lord dooth satisfie him in euery of them. The difficulties that he alledgeth, were, one of them, as touching the whole matter generally; others, as touching certain considerations thereof more specially. As touching the whole matter generally, his difficulty was, that himselfe was no such person, as was any way meet to such a purpose. So that how ready soeuer, in flesh &amp; bloud, he was before to haue taken vpō him the deliuerance of the people, while he was in that ruffe in the Court (which it seemeth, by killing that <hi>Egyptian;</hi> reprouing <note place="margin">Exod. 2, 11. 13.</note> a wrong doer of his own people; &amp; by the conceit that he had of himself, supposing his brethren would haue known, that by his hands God would deliuer thē, he could <note place="margin">Acts. 7. 25.</note> haue beene content, readily then to haue taken in hand:) yet now when hee hath his calling indeede, and the forwardnesse of flesh and blood is abated in him, he is in spirit (whereby he better seeth and waigheth the burthen of it) very vnwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to meddle with it. As touching which difficulty of his, the satisfaction that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> the Lord doth giue him for that matter, is, that first he telleth him that neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse <note place="margin">Exod. 3, 12</note> he must plucke vp his heart to do it; and addeth this reason, that himselfe wil be with him: then, the better to confirme him in it, he telleth him farther, that that his manner of appearing vnto him may bee sufficient to resolue him in it; and that <note place="margin">Tr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>l.</note> he should so assuredly deliuer them thence, that he and the people should afterward worship him there, neare to that Mountaine. Those others that touched cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:7530:69"/> considerations thereof more specially do some of them respect the credite of his message with the Children of <hi>Israel:</hi> others seeme rathers to respect the dignity of it with <hi>Pharaoh</hi> the King. Those that respect the credit of his message with the children of <hi>Israel</hi> are two: one, of a defect that he conceiueth, that the message it selfe was not clee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed off as yet; the other, that he doubteth would after arise of their incredulity. That which he conceiueth, the message it selfe was not cleared of yet, was, that God not hauing tolde him his name yet, as hee conceiued, when he should come to the children of <hi>Israel</hi> with that message from the God of theyr Fathers, if they should aske him what his name was, himselfe could not as yet tell them: so now he asketh what in such case he should say vnto them. So, in this his vnwillingnesse to be thus employed, he dooth not content himselfe with the <note place="margin">Ibid. 6.</note> name that God in his owne hearing, did giue vnto himselfe before, when he sayde he was the God of <hi>Abraham, Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Iacob;</hi> not with that which <hi>Moses</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe did attribute vnto him imediatly after, calling him the Lord: but now enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth <note place="margin">Ibid 7.</note> of some other name of God that should be more peculiar and proper vnto him, whereas indeede neither of these could be attributed to any other but only to him. <note place="margin">Ibid, 13</note> So now must he haue, as the Prouerbe is, <hi>A ioynt in a Rush:</hi> or otherwise, a Rush it selfe shall be no Rush with him now. God neuerthelesse in this also will yeelde vnto him. For first, he doth satisfie his desire therein: and then informeth him farther, as touching the message he had to do. He satisfieth his desire therein, in that he giueth himselfe another name: and yet not so, but that he continueth the others withall. That other name which now hee giueth vnto himselfe, is in the <note place="margin">Ibid. 14.</note> Hebrew <hi>Eheje:</hi> as euer being of himselfe; and of whom all others haue their bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the time that they are. Those other names that he retaineth withall, are, The Lord; and that he is the God of <hi>Abraham, Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Iacob:</hi> adding farther <note place="margin">Ibid. 15.</note> withall, that this should be his Memoriall, or, as we say, his Stile of Honour, for euer. A wonderfull goodnesse, that to be the God of so silly men, should haue such a place in the honourable Stile of so glorious a God. As touching the mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage that he had to doo, his information is, first as touching the children of <hi>Israell:</hi> then, as touching the King of <hi>Egypt.</hi> As touching the children of <hi>Israell,</hi> how he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> must deale with them: and what effect the same should take with them. His dealing with them must be this, first he must go and gather the Elders of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple <note place="margin">Ibid. 16-18.</note> together: then, he must tell them, that the God of their Fathers hath appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto him, and sayde, that he had good regard vnto them, and to the sufferings they had in <hi>Egypt;</hi> and therefore, that now he would bring them forth thence, and giue them a very good land of their owne. The effect that this should take with them, was, that they should well accept of that message, and gladly receiue it. As touching the King, he and the Elders of <hi>Israel</hi> must go together vnto him, and tell <note place="margin">Ibid. 18. &amp; 5, 3</note> him, that now the God of their Fathers had appeared vnto them, and commanded them to come forth a three dayes iourney into the wildernesse adioyning, and there to Sacrifice vnto him; otherwise, that one way or other, they should be in daunger to kindle his wrath against them: that therefore they desired him to vouchsafe them that fauour, that with his good licence so they might. What effect this shoulde take with him, the Lord himselfe before hand doth tell them: namely, that he would <note place="margin">Ibid. 19-22.</note> not let them go, till he should be by the strong hand of God vppon him, compelled unto it; yet in the end God would make them so gracious, or giue them such fauour with the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> that at their departure, requesting whatsoeuer precious things of them they would, the <hi>Egyptians</hi> should so readily bestow the same vppon them, that thereby they should haue with them (in a manner) euen all the whole spoyle of the Land of <hi>Egypt.</hi> That which he doubted, would after arise of their incredulity, was <note place="margin">Ibid. 4. 1.</note> that when in this sort he should come vnto them, neuerthelesse they would not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue him: nor that the Lord had appeared vnto him. A maruellous matter, that he should yet put so manifest doubt in this, when as the Lord himselfe a little before, in plaine tearmes had otherwise told him: and that the Lord did so quietly put vp, that he was so directly crossed by him. The satisfaction that the Lord dooth giue him in this, is very great; furnishing him with three great signes and woonderfull
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:7530:70"/> workes, to testifie vnto them, that his vocation therein was (without question) of God indeede: whereof he gaue him present experience for a couple of them: and affured him of the like certainty for the thirde besides. Those two, whereof hee <note place="margin">Ibid, 2-8.</note> gaue him present experience, were, one of his Staffe, by casting it downe present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be turned into a Serpent, and by taking it vp to be turned into his staffe againe: the other, by putting his hand into his bosome, to be taken out leprous; and then, putting it into his bosome again, and pulling it forth, to be as whole as it was before. That wherein he assured him of the like certainty, was, that if neede should be, they not crediting the two former, then should he take vp in the fight of them some wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <note place="margin">Ibid. 9.</note> out of one of the Riuers, and poure it on the dry land, and it should be turned to blood. Those others that seeme rather to respect the dignity of his message with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
               <hi>Pharaoh</hi> the King, were other two: in the former of which, he nameth a speciall im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment in himselfe, whereby he is a great deale more vnfit to bee sent of any mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage, then that he may become such an office vnto a King, and from so great a Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty as his; in the other hee doth not name any thing in particular, but seemeth to sticke on that point still. That which in the former he doth specially name, is the impedement of his speach: a thing indeede, in the common iudgement of all, as vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meete <note place="margin">Ibid, 10</note> for an Ambassadour to be imployed from one Prince to another, especially, if the Princes be great, as lightly any other is taken to be. The satisfaction that in <note place="margin">Ibid. 11-12.</note> this God doth giue him, is, that he knew well enough of his impediment, and could haue made him otherwise if he would, but that he would take him as he was, &amp; him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe would so be with him, as that he would sufficiently supply whatsoeuer want was in him thereby. A very good Caueat vnto vs all, to take heed that we neuer be ouer curious in such Seruants of God as it pleaseth him at any time to send vnto vs; as to reiect them, or to be offended in them, for some speciall impediment that in them we finde: when as that mighty King of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> must be content with stammering <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses;</hi> and that from the God of all glory, who of all others was able to haue sent much better furnished if himselfe so would. In the other he nameth nothing, but seemeth <note place="margin">Ibid. 13.</note> to rest on that still: and so beseecheth GOD to make choyce of some other more meete for his purpose, and more beseeming the worthy Honour of him that sendeth. At which his tergiuersation the Lord was now offended with him: and yet so bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth with his weakenesse therein, that he ioyneth <hi>Aaron</hi> his Brother in Commission <note place="margin">Ibid. 14. 17.</note> with him, <hi>Aaron</hi> being of ready vtterance; but so, as that hee must first direct him what he should say, and that <hi>Aaron</hi> should then deliuer it. In which one example, those that are discontented with such alike thing now among vs (namely, that when in so many places the needfull maintenance of the Ministery is so much with-drawne from it, that there is not sufficient remaining to maintaine an able man in euery of them, there bee now, by the more able sort of the Ministery, certaine <hi>Homilies</hi> or <hi>Sermons</hi> prouided, by the meaner sort to bee to the people deliuered) might finde wherewithall to content themselues: that prouision of ours, hauing, in this, so preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant an example for it, as neede to be; and so much more pregnant, as that GOD did not then neede, to vse the help of a couple, for the labour of one in that, so much as the Church now doth need it, in this.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Those that it pleased God to vse in that businesse, were, as now we see; <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> and <hi>Aaron</hi> his Brother, and so now to finde what it was that passed betwixt them and those with whom they dealt, we are to see; first, how these addressed themselues to that businesse: then, what passed betwixt them and those others. Howe these addressed themselues to their businesse, is declared vnto vs, first of eyther of them a part by themselues: then, of them both together. A part by themselues; first, it is shewed how <hi>Moses</hi> addressed himselfe vnto it: then, how the like was done by <hi>Aaron</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> also. As touching <hi>Moses,</hi> beeing now in the Wildernesse, and hauing there (as it seemeth) his family with him, hee would first returne to his Father in Law: and then, set forward thence into <hi>Aegypt.</hi> So first addressing himselfe to goe to his Father in <note place="margin">Ibid. 18. 20.</note> Law, and so taking his Wife and Children with him, two speciall thinges did befall him by the way: one, that now again the Lord (assuring him first, that all those were
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:7530:70"/> dead that before sought his death) gaue him speciall warning, both to doo all those signes that hee had willed him to doo (but yet that himselfe would <note place="margin">Ibid. 19, 21, 23</note> harden his heart, that hee would not let them go:) and at length to tell him, that <hi>Israel</hi> was his first borne, and that for detaining of him, not suffering him to go to serue him, he would therefore destroy his first borne also: the other, that the Lord was offended with <hi>Moses,</hi> for that his Sonne was yet vncircumcised <note place="margin">Ibid. 4<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>6.</note> (and so it may seeme there was not that care of Religion in <hi>Moses,</hi> that he ought to haue had) especially when now he should goe about this so speciall a seruice of God: and when he was thereupon circumcised, then was his wife so much offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with him, as that for that cause it seemeth he then left her behind him. In which <note place="margin">Ibid. 27, 28</note> meane time, God had willed <hi>Aaron</hi> to go meete his Brother <hi>Moses</hi> in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse; which <hi>Aaron</hi> also accordingly did: and so <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> met together on the way; and <hi>Moses</hi> imparted the matter vnto him that now they both were to go about. So comming first to the Children of <hi>Israell</hi> as they were directed, and now to marke what passed betwixt <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> on the one side, and them on <note place="margin">Ibid. 29-31</note> the other; first, they found them in very good tempet: but afterward out of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per cleane. When <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> came first vnto them, and did their message, and confirmed the same with the signes appointed, both they beleeued; and, for those great fauours of God, worshipped also. Out of temper they were, when <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> hauing beene with <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and he imposing more labour vpon them, they made suite to haue the same remitted, but yet obtained no fauour therein, and were besides worse entreated than before. For then, first lighting <note place="margin">Ibid. 5, 20, 21</note> on <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> being in their way, with open mouth they cryed out vppon them: and, when afterward they came vnto them againe from the Lord, to assure <note place="margin">Ibid. 6, 1-8.</note> them of that which before was told them, and did now deliuer the same more spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially vnto them, they neuerthelesse did not regard them, for the oppression and anguish that now they were in, by their greeuous seruitude now doubled vppon them. And so it is the manner of vs also, though at the first we be glad of deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerance offeted vnto vs: yet when persecution commeth withall, then to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw our selues againe, and to storme against those by whom our deliuerance was so attempted. Comming to <hi>Pharaoh</hi> the King, they haue a great deale more bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse with him: neuerthelesse they giue him not ouer, but follow on him still, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till in the end they haue obtained. But the businesse they haue with him is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers: the King first becomming more grieuous vnto the people thereby; then, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> but framing himselfe to hang off from the obedience that is required. In both which we are to note, in what sort <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> on the one side, and he on the other, prosecute the course that they haue in hand. In the former of these therefore, <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> come vnto him, and had as it were two encounters be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them. For first, they required, in the name of the Lord, the God of <hi>Israell,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ibid. 5, 1.</note> that he would let the people go, to holde feast vnto him in that wildernesse that was neere vnto them. To which the King answered, that he knew no such Lord <note place="margin">Ibid. 2.</note> at whose command he should let <hi>Israel</hi> go: and therefore neither would hee let them go. Then they tolde him, that their God, the God of the <hi>Hebrewes,</hi> had appeared vnto them, and required, that they should go▪ three dayes iourney into the wildernesse, and Sacrifice vnto him: and thereuppon, did also beseech him, that he would giue them leaue so to doe, least for neglecting the same, God did cast some punishment on them. Which when they had sayd, then did <hi>Pharaoh</hi> not only giue an hard answere to them: but also tooke present order, for the farther straightning of all the people. His answere to them was, that the people were many; and therefore it was no wisedome to giue them spare time from their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour: <note place="margin">Ibid. 4. 5.</note> that themselues did ill, to put such things into their heads; and therefore himselfe commanded them now, to returne to their burthens againe. In the order that he presently tooke for the further straightning of all the people, we are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider what it was; and how immooueable himselfe was to alter the same. To find out what it was, we are to note, what it vvas as it proceeded from him: then, what it vvas as it vvas executed on them. As it proceeded from him, the selfe same
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:7530:71"/> day he called for the Ouer-seers of the people, and first tolde them what he woulde haue them to doo: then, he sheweth them, what was his meaning or purpose there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. That which he would haue them to doe, was, that they should see to it, that <note place="margin">Ibid. 6-8</note> there were no more Straw giuen to the people: and yet that no part of their wonted task of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rick that they made, should, for it, be diminished vnto them. His purpose and <note place="margin">Ibid. 8, 9.</note> meaning he shewed to be, because they would needs haue leaue to go and sacrifice to their God, he would now haue those labours of theirs so increased vpon them; for that he perceiued they were but idle, and this would be a good readie way to make them little to regard such vaine toyes. A notable patterne of the children of the world, whether Princes or others, first how loath they are to let those that are vnder their charge, to haue any good conuenient libertie or time to serue the Lord: then, how they account the seruice of God to be but as a needlesse thing, in comparison of their other meaner affayres; and to bee giuen thereunto, is but the fruite of a weake and an idle braine. Himselfe goeth some-what farther, giuing (most wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedly) <note place="margin">Ibid. 9.</note> the verie lie vnto the manifest truth of God: accounting, that such as are Religious, do no more but pretend it, hauing no such meaning in them indeede, measuring others, belike, by themselues. And such are our worldlings too, in the inward secrecy of their hearts: but <hi>Pharaoh</hi> professed no regarde of the Lorde, and therefore was so much the more open hearted therein; ours professe both the knowledge and feare of God, and therefore are loath in such cases to say all that they thinke. As this his Commandement was forth-with executed on them, they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> were so pinched with the rigour of it, that the people of <hi>Israel</hi> were faine to disperse themselues ouer all the land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> to plucke vp Stubble, where they could get it, <note place="margin">Ibid. 10. 14.</note> to serue their turne instead of Straw: and yet notwithstanding were punished be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, for that they wre not able to do. How immoueable himselfe was to alter the same, is euident inough, in that when they came and complained thereof to the King, he sent them away as they came, charging them to be idle, and nothing at all <note place="margin">Ibid. 15, 18.</note> casing them in that vniust and greeuous vexation they had.</p>
            <p n="5">5 When he did but frame himselfe to hang off from the obedience that was <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> required, we are to see, first in what sort it was required by them: then, how it was denied by him. It was required by them, first but onely by one signe that they did before him: but then after by the smart of punnishments cast vpon him and his. When it was done by that one signe, we are to note, first what was done by <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron:</hi> then, what was done by the King himselfe. As touching <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> we are also to note, first how <hi>Moses,</hi> being somwhat discoraged, by that far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vexation of the people, and by their clamorousnesse against him and his brother thereupon, doth now som-what stagger, til he be by the Lord againe confirmed. So it shall not be amisse, to marke how hee is againe (as it were) renewed: then, how he doth proceede in his businesse. To finde how he is againe renewed, wee are to note, what it is whereon he complaineth: and how God doth satisfye him againe. He complaineth first, that God, as it were, hath not done well to send him about it, when as the people haue thereby since beene in worse case for it; and yet himselfe <note place="margin">Ibid. 5, 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

To the former of these God doth tell him, that neuerthelesse, now he shall see, that he will giue them a mighty deliuerance: and <note place="margin">Ibid. 5: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

For the latter of these, that hee had <note place="margin">Ibid. 7, 4-8.</note> alreadie appointed him to be as <hi>Pharaohs</hi> God, and <hi>Aaron</hi> to be his Interpreter: and so yet would haue him but acquaint <hi>Aaron</hi> withal, that he should say vnto him; and that <hi>Aaron</hi> should deliuer the same vnto <hi>Pharaoh.

Out of this order that God obserued, doing all those great workes not only by <hi>Moses,</hi> but partly by <hi>Aaron</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so; and more specially vsing the hand of <hi>Aaron</hi> onely in certaine of them, we haue a good Caueat against that backewardnesse that we find in many, to vndertake the seruice of God: especially when the same is of some dfficulty, and seemeth to bee ouer-great a burthen for vs to beare. For in such case wee commonly shrinke from it; or neuer lightly yeeld our obedience vnto it, vntill we haue, to our owne contentment some helpe adioyned. So was it with <hi>Moses</hi> in the businesse that now we haue in hand, as we saw before. God would haue vsed his Ministery on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly therein: but he still hung off, till <hi>Aaron</hi> his elder Brother was put in Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion <note place="margin">Exod. 7: 10.</note> with him. Had he taken it vppon him as the Lord did call him, there is no question, but that he should himselfe haue beene sufficient enough vnto the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, because the Lord promised, himself to be with him, and he is not wont to lay more on any than himselfe doth giue them strength to beare: and so should he also haue had the glory of it that God did meane him. But now hanging off so much as he did, so it came to passe, that not onely <hi>Aaron</hi> was now ioyned in Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> with him: but also that by his hands chiefely, diuers of those great workes were performed.

In that other that made <hi>Pharaoh</hi> somewhat to stoope, wee are likewise to note; first, what it was: then, how farre forth hee stooped vnto it. The plague it selfe, was <note place="margin">Ibid. 8: 1-6</note> that strange and wonderfull number of Frogges that came out of their Riuers (so soone as <hi>Aaron</hi> had stroken one of them) which not onely couered the face of the Earth: but also annoied all the people in the Countrey, in their houses, and in all their Chambers, Vessels, and such like; and euen in the Kinges Pallace likewise. How farre forth <hi>Pharaoh</hi> stooped heereto, that we may the better find, wee are to note, that first for the time after a sort he yeelded: but then, shortly after, turned on it againe. He so farre yeelded, that calling for <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> he both desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them to pray for him, that this strange scourge might be taken from him; and <note place="margin">Ibid. 8.</note> promised them withall, that now he would let them goe to sacrifice to the Lorde their God: and yet notwithstanding had those Sorcerers by their Incantations be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the like in his presence. In his turning on it againe we are to note, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">Ibid. 7.</note> that so he did: but also, that he did it against a speciall good helpe that hee had to stand better vnto it. As touching the former, the Text is plaine, that after hee <note place="margin">Ibid. 15.</note> was eased a while of that plague, he quickly turned vnto his former bad Bias a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. The helpe that he had to stand better vnto it, was, most of all in the manner that was vsed in taking of this aforesaide plague from him: but partly, in a sensible experiment that was left behinde it, shewing how noysome a thing it was, when it was vpon them.

               <hi>Pharaoh</hi> himselfe, that it was the hand of God: yet notwithstanding he would not yeelde, but remained as afore, disobedient still. In those that were done by the handes of <hi>Moses;</hi> especially, it seemeth that it pleased God to vouchsafe him two other speciall and mighty callings, much like after the same manner: in eyther of them first giuen him warning twice; then, bringing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> third vpon him without any warning. In the former of these two callings, and in the first of those plagues that by the Ministery of <hi>Moses</hi> were cast vpon him, hee did for a time some-what relent: but not in the others. In that wherein he did something relent, we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 word">

That he might bee admonished of it, the Lord willed <hi>Moses</hi> to get vp betime, and to goe vnto <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and in his name to require him to let his people goe: otherwise, that the <note place="margin">Ibid. 8: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Which fore-warning taking little place with him, the next day was that plague brought in vppon them. His relenting was, that now calling for <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> first he was content, that they should go &amp; sacrifice to the Lord in that Land of <hi>Aegypt:</hi> but, when that was by <hi>Moses</hi> refused, then he yeelded they should goe and doe it in the Wildernesse; but, by the intercession of <hi>Moses,</hi> being eased of those noysome Creatures, then would hee not performe his graunt vnto them.

Now therefore, without any war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning before giuen vnto <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> the Lord biddeth <hi>Moses</hi> to addresse himself to the <note place="margin">Ibid. 10: 21-28</note> third of this cal, which was a thick and palpable darknesse for three daies together: yet only on the residue of the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and nothing at all wheresoeuer the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
               <hi>Israelites</hi> dwelt among them. Concerning which, we are first to see how far the same worketh with <hi>Pharaoh:</hi> then, to note some speciall thinges heere in <hi>Moses</hi> besides. As touching <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> though he were so terrified with it, thet now he sendeth for <hi>Moses</hi> againe about that matter: yet for a small trifle he breaketh with him now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine also; and chargeth him besides, neuer to see his face any more. As touching <hi>Moses,</hi> they are two principall matters, that are to bee more specially noted in him: first, how little in one point he yeelded to <hi>Pharaoh;</hi> then, how readily he ioi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth with him in another. That wherein hee yeeldeth so little vnto him, was in <hi>Pharaohs</hi> demaund to leaue their Cattle behind them: and that so, both themselues <note place="margin">Ibid. 10-24.</note> and their Children might nowe goe forth and worshippe the Lord as they desired: whereunto <hi>Moses</hi> would not yeelde, so much as to leaue one hoofe behinde them. <note place="margin">Ibid. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

That <note place="margin">Ibid. 28, 29.</note> other wherein so readily he ioyned with him, was, when hee charged him to see his face no more: he presently telling him, that no more hee would; and then by and <note place="margin">Ibid. 11: 4-8.</note> by after opening vnto him how it should bee performed, but nothing at all to his contentment.

            <p n="7">7. How in the end it was effected, wee haue deliuered vnto vs, first, in that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> which the Lord did in that matter on their behalfe; then, in that which was by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues acknowledged. That which the Lord did in that matter on their behalfe, was, first to make the <hi>Egyptians</hi> themselues to let them go: then, to free them out of another danger of them, that himselfe did afterward bring them into. That where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he made the <hi>Egyptians</hi> themselues willingly to let them go, was, that sudden death of all the first borne of men, &amp; of the first bred of their Catle, throughout the whole Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> to come vpon them that night ensuing; but yet, that all the children of <hi>Israel</hi> should bee freed from it. Concerning which, wee are to note, first in what sort it was denounced vnto him: then, how it was accordingly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed. In the denouncing of it vnto him, wee are to note, that <hi>Moses</hi> doth so readily ioyne with <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> not to see his face any more, as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> then, in menacing manner, had forbidden vnto him, that thereby it appeareth there was <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> some speciall cause whereupon he did it. So are we first to examine, whereupon it may seeme that he did it: then hauing that ground-worke, in what sort hee did it. That, whereupon it may seeme that he did it, and the ground-worke he had vnto it, was, as it seemeth, that God had now made him priuie what he would do: which was, that now he would so very speedily, and in such sort send them away, as that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede it was not likely, that euer hee should see his face againe. For whereas it was now the fourteenth day of that month, when <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and <hi>Moses</hi> had this talke <note place="margin">Ibid. 11: 4.</note> betwixt them, and in such sort parted (for now he saide vnto him, that the next night following should this plague be cast vpon him) and it is plaine by that which follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that God had made him priuy vnto it, before the tenth day of that present: here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by <note place="margin">Ibid, 12: 3.</note> it is likely, that of that foreknowledge of his, he was now so readie so to ioyn with him. So we haue something to note as touching this thing it selfe: then, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what beside, of another thing concurring with it. As touching the thing it selfe, it is to be marked, that although <hi>Moses</hi> himselfe had a particular knowledge there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: yet he imparted not so much vnto <hi>Pharaoh.</hi> That himselfe had a very particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar knowledge of it, it appeareth in this, that hee was directed to haue the people in such a readinesse against that time, as that they had to make a quicke dispatch that night euen of their Supper. In that hee did not impart the particulars of that his <note place="margin">Ibid. 11.</note> knowledge vnto <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> but onely the effect or substance of it (which notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding he then did deliuer verie plainly vnto him) and vsed (that we read of) no speciall perswasion or entreating of him, in time to see to it: we are to note, that in many of the iudgements of God that are towards vs, it may verie well be, that we also haue no more, but onely a plaine denouncing of them, and no entreatie nor perswasion at all to auoide them; no, not of the best Seruants of God that are. That other thing that concurred withall, was, that the people were now also before hand direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, <note place="margin">Ibid. 11: 1-3.</note> to aske of the <hi>Egyptians</hi> whatsoeuer precious thinges they had that they liked; that so their long seruice not yet considered, might now at the length be somewhat better rewarded: and were assured withall, that they should readily obtaine what they desired. In the performance of it, we are to note, first how God prouideth for the safetie of his owne people: then, how hee powreth forth his wrath on the others. In that which was done for the safetie of his owne people we are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, what was therein appointed for themselues: and what for their children. That which was appointed for themselues, was for their safetie then: wherein, wee are to consider, what course was taken for the accomplishment of it; and how auaile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able it was vnto them. The course that was taken for it, was, that now by this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion hee ordained and appointed vnto them their other Sacrament, the Pascall Lambe: a figure of Christ, and sending vs all, for all our safety, onely to him. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <note place="margin">Exo. 12: 1-28.</note>
               <pb n="124" facs="tcp:7530:74"/> we are more specially to note, that whereas it might bee of either kinds of their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> smaller Cattle, that is, either Lambe or Kid (for the worde, with them, signifyeth both) yet needs must it be without blemish: and then to be vsed as was appointed. In that it must be without blemish, wee are giuen to vnderstande, that it is onelie <note place="margin">Ibid. 5.</note> the most holy and mighty God, in whom there was any safety to be found; and that they could in no wise be holpen therein, by men nor Angelles: all men being sinners by nature; and God finding some imperfection in his Angels also. The vse of it that was to them appointed, was first, but onely for the blood of it: but then, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately after, for the Lambe or Kid it selfe. The blood thereof, was to be sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led on the posts of the doores of all the <hi>Israelites,</hi> and they that were within, must <note place="margin">Ibid. 7.</note> be safe thereby. And true it is, that the blood of Iesus Christ being sprinckled in our hearts by faith in him, wee also are safe vnder that protection. The Lambe or Kid it selfe, that is, the flesh thereof must be not so idely gazed vpon, or worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, but eaten: as we also must so feede on the flesh or man-hoode of our Lambe <note place="margin">Ibid. 4, 8.</note> Iesus Christ. But heerein are we more specially to consider, who they were that must eate thereof: and in what manner it must be eaten. As touching the parties we finde, that both all are called vnto it; and yet, that exceptions are taken to some. In that all are called vnto it, and vnder paine to be rooted out or cut off from among <note place="margin">Ibid. 47. Num. 9: 13.</note> the people, it is plaine thereby, that God will not haue the workes of his wisedome at any time neglected by any of his (especially, not so speciall a worke as this:) a thing that had neede to be better regarded, of all our Recusants and Non-commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicants; and of all godlesse persons besides. The exceptions that are taken, are, first of Forraigners: then of the <hi>Israelites</hi> also. Forraigners were not to bee at all <note place="margin">Ibi. 43-45, 48 Numb. 9: 13.</note> admitted vnto it, till first they were circumcised and so become <hi>Israelites</hi> by profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion with the rest. Neither do our Sacraments appertaine vnto any but onelie to those that are of the Faith, or professe themselues to bee Christians. When ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception is taken to the <hi>Israelites</hi> themselues, as to some of them exception is taken: <note place="margin">Num. 9. 6-12.</note> so is there a remedie ministred vnto them; and by that occasion, to others also. The exception that is taken, is vnto those that are Legally vncleane: a plaine document to vs also, that so long as we are in our vncleannesse, not repenting vs of our sinne, or woonted corruption, in Religion or life, so long are we vnmeete to come to the holy Communion. The remedie that is ministred vnto them, and by that occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to others also, is, that both those that were then vncleane, and such as were in their iourney, should both sorts of them (on paine aforesaide) take the selfe-same day of the next month ensuing. A plaine and fearefull conuiction to those that so long absent themselues from the holy Communion, whatsoeuer pretence it may bee they haue to their owne contentment. As touching the manner of it, we are first to consider of the preparation that was to go before: then, of dispatching the thing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> it selfe. The preparation that was to go before was partly of that which was to be eaten: and partly of those that were to eate it. That which was to bee eaten, was chiefely the Lambe or Kid that now we speake of: but partly also, the bread that was to be vsed with it. The Lambe or Kid must not be sodden nor raw, but rosted with fire: and must bee whole, in no wise parted to seuerall houses; nor so much as one <note place="margin">Exod. 12: 8. 9</note> bone of him broken. And truely the Lambe of our redemption, Iesus Christ, was roasted indeede, being made the obiect of Gods Iustice and wrath for vs: but is in <note place="margin">Ibid. 4-46. Numb. 9: 12.</note> no wise to be deuided, but to be eaten in one house onely, and others if they will to come vnto him, and to make part of that Houshold the Church, but hee to be diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to none other. As also that we may the better see, that it was he that was thus prefigured, it is plainly noted, that not a bone of him also might be broken. The <note place="margin">Iohn 19: 36.</note> bread that was to be vsed there-with, might not be such as was most commonly vsed <note place="margin">Exodus. 12: 8. 15-20.</note> with them, and to the most part of men the most toothsome, which was such as was leauened; but vnleauened onely, such as the most part little vsed, not so acceptable to most mens tast, and yet the daintier bread of the two: and this must bee vsed all the weeke following. Euen as we also comming to feed on our Pascal Iesus Christ, or professing him should not abide in our woonted mediocritie of zeale towardes God, and regard of our wayes among men, though that stand best with most mens

               </gap> should presse to bee very singular in them both, a farre better course by many degrees: euen all the whole time of our feasting heere in Iesus Christ. In those that were to eate it, we find, that being to goe a iourney, they were to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly prouided. Their iourney was, presently to depart from the Lande of <note place="margin">Ibid. 31. 41.</note>
               <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and to goe (by the Desart or Wildernesse of <hi>Arabia)</hi> vnto the Land that God promised to giue them: as we also in like sort are, vpon the eating of our Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Iesus Christ, to depart from all euill, and (by the Wildernesse of this World) to hasten to our true Sanctification heere, and to that most blessed estate which is alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy prouided for vs in the World to come. Their preparation was, most of it ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e they should bee furnished: but part of it also, with what speede it shoulde bee dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched. The furniture also that to them was appointed, was most of it onely for their better dispatch of the way: but part of it not onely for it, but against the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my too. That which was onely for their better dispatch in the way, was, that theyr <note place="margin">Ibid. 11.</note> loynes must be girded; and their shooes on their feete: as we also are to take in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>r affections vnto the thinges of this Worlde; and to addresse our selues patiently to suffer, whatsoeuer commeth in the way of our calling. That which was not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">Ibid. 11.</note> for it, but against the Enemy too, was, that they shoulde haue theyr staues in theyr handes, whereby they might, both ease themselues so much the better in the way, and in some reasonable manner to bee able holde off the Enemy also: as we in like sort by the Scriptures may both ease and comfort our selues, when we <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> begin to faint or bee weary; and very well repulse the enemy also. The speede <note place="margin">Ibid. 11.</note> that was to be vsed herein, was, that they must dispatch that meale of theirs in hast; so to be ready forth-with to be gone, so soone as opportunity thereto should bee offered vnto them: as wee also should euer make a quicke dispatch of all our bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly necessities; that so we also might be in a readinesse to all opportunities, for bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter matters, the best that wee can. The dispatching of the thing it selfe, or spen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of it, was ordained to be such, that they might not haue such respect to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues therein, as Flesh and Bloud is wont to vsurpe; whether to feede our owne pleasures when wee come to the daintier meats: or in a kind of thriftinesse also to make store thereof. To preuent the former, there was order taken, that they should <note place="margin">Ibid. 8.</note> eate it with bitter or sower Hearbes: for the latter likewise, that they should leaue <note place="margin">Ibid. 10.</note> nought till the morrow (but take in of their Neighbours to help to spend it, if their owne Family were too little) so to preuent all miserable sparing in the worship of <note place="margin">Ibid. 3, 4.</note> God. How auaileable he made the same vnto them, may sufficiently appeare, not <note place="margin">Ibid. 13, 23.</note> onely for that the Lorde so promised; and <hi>Moses</hi> accordingly deliuered the same to the people: but also, for that the people are before-hand taught, so to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge <note place="margin">Ibid. 27. Ibid. 13: 1, 11-16.</note> in the ages ensuing; and for that the Lord doth thereuppon claime the first borne and bred of the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> to bee his for euer after. That which was appointed for their Children, was, that those their Parents should teach them the mystery and meaning of it: as a matter of speciall moment; and euery yeare, <note place="margin">Exo. 12: 26, 27 13: 8-10</note> at the time appointed, to be obserued. Wee also should teach our Children the mystery and meaning of our Sacraments, as matters of rare and singular moment, and neuer to be neglected by any: a course that in these daies were so much the more needfull, at euery where we finde it too rife, that, for want thereof, notwithstanding that in our infancie (when we could not otherwise doe) we all receiued the one, yet many of vs doe very much neglect, and others altogether refuse the other; a shreud probability, that if Baptizme were to bee againe receiued, those that make so light of the Communion now, would then make as light of Baptizme also. His owne people being thus set in safety before, hee presently thereupon so poured foorth that wrath of his vppon the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> that there was not an house, wherein there was not one dead: insomuch that they presently got vppe; cryed out amaine; gaue the <note place="margin">Ibi. 12: 29-36</note> Children of <hi>Israell</hi> leaue to depart; hasted them forward; and gaue them whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer they asked, to be rid of them now. The danger that the Lord himselfe did af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward bring them into, was partly, while yet they were in <hi>Aegypt</hi> it selfe, but yet going out of it: and partly in the Red Sea when they left the Land of <hi>Aegypt.</hi> While <note place="margin">Ibid. 37.</note>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> yet they were in it, whereas from <hi>Rameses</hi> where they were, they had a ready way be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:7530:75"/> two Seas (one, on their right hand, and another, on their left) lying East-ward from them, it pleased God, not to carry them that way, being the vsuall and readiest <note place="margin">Ibid. 13: 17, 18</note> way, least if the people should be encountred with the <hi>Philistims</hi> that dwelt in those partes, they might so be discouraged (a good example to haue regard to those that be weake: and a good warning withall to the Children of the World, that they doe not rashly iudge of the gouernment that God vseth oft-times among his people; as the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> and <hi>Pharaoh</hi> himselfe shortly after in this thing did:) but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

In this their passage, it pleased God to vouchsafe them two speciall fauours: one, that hee gaue them the same extraordinary guide, by that Cloude and Piller of Fire; the other, that when they were closed vp (as it <note place="margin">Ibid. 13: 21, 22</note> were) in the Iawes of death, hauing the Red Sea before them, mightie Rockes on the right hand and on the left, and their Enemies pursuing vpon them hard behinde, <note place="margin">Ibid. 14: 1-22.</note> and so closing them vp on euery side, it pleased God now to open vnto them mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culously a passage by Sea. Those in the Red Sea, were two others likewise: one, <note place="margin">Ibid. 23-25.</note> that he so lingered the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> Charrets and Forces, that although they hasted after them to ouertake them, yet they were neuer able to doe it: the other, that in <note place="margin">Ibid. 26-28.</note> the ende hee quite ouerthrewe them there in the Sea. A comfortable patterne for these dayes also, that whereas that iniurious vsurpation of <hi>Rome,</hi> hauing of late vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their bondage those that are the more reformed Churches now; and diuers there be that feare, seeing it doth so hotly pursue them still, it will one day get them vnder againe: by this example (and by the course of Scripture besides) there is very good hope ministred vnto vs, that although they neuer so busily labour it still; yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding they shall neuer haue their desire therein, no more then <hi>Pharaoh</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned in this. That which themselues acknowledged, was, that vpon this their deliuerance, sorting themselues according to their Sexe <hi>(Moses</hi> himselfe leading the <note place="margin">Exo. 15: 1-21.</note> Men; and <hi>Mary</hi> his Sister, the Women) they altogether, with Songs, Timbrels, and Daunces, gaue thankes vnto God for those his mercies.</p>

They were nowe growne to such a people, that they are noted to be about sixe hundred thousand men, besides their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren: <note place="margin">Exod. 12: 37.</note> they also not being wont in such cases, to reckon theyr Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. So that parting those foure hundred and thirty years which <note place="margin">Exo. 21: 40, 41 Gal. 3: 17.</note> are spoken of in diuers places of Scripture, into two equall partes, it is certaine, that in the former of them, from the calling of <hi>Abraham,</hi> to the time that <hi>Iacob</hi> came <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> into <hi>Aegypt,</hi> the peculiar people of God were then (of lyneall descent) but three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score and tenne; whereas now, but so much time more (iust as it seemeth) hath mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplyed those to aboue sixe hundred thousand: the former also beeing no way hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of their growth; but these very much oppressed, and whom their hard Lordes endeuoured (for a long time) cleane to destroy. So the Bush indeede burned: but was not consumed. What that estate of theirs hath beene, that we may the better finde, we are to know, that long they were his peculiar and onely people (to speake of) in all the World: and for most of that time, euen al that whole people generally; but that afterward hee reserued vnto him but part of them onely. While they were all his people generally, for a time hee kept them heere in this Wildernesse, ioyning on the Red Sea, whereinto now he hath newly brought them: but afterward he gaue
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:7530:75"/> them a Land to dwell in, and they accordingly did long enioy it. In this Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse they were but a while as their necessary occasions did require: but yet long by their owne default. While they were there on necessary occasions, it pleased the Lord now that he had brought them thither, and had them onely vnder his gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, otherwise to spend somewhat better than one yeare with them: but then, to lead them on towardes the Land he had promised before to giue them. In that time that before he spent with them, somewhat better than one whole yeare, the effect of all seemeth to be this, that he was disposed to teach them (and vs by them) a couple of lessons: one, in all their necessities to seeke vnto him, and there to rest; the other, to be an orderly people. The sonner of these he teacheth them, by bringing them into certaine wantes: and then, himselfe supplying the same vnto them. Those wantes or necessities of theirs wherein he would haue them so farre to depend vpon him (so farre as these Stories doe lead vs to gather) were most of all as touching their sustenance: but partly the safety of their persons also against their enemies. As touching their sustenance, they came so prouided out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> for a good part of it yet, that the first thing they wanted, was wherewithall to coole their thirst: but afterwardes they found want of both the maine parts of needefull sustenance, both what to eate, and what to drinke. When first they wanted to coole their thirst, we are first to consider, of that Story it selfe: then, of another thereon depending. In that Story it selfe we are to consider, how the Lord prooued them for the time: and how soone after hee holpe them againe. His tryall of them was, that nowe they <note place="margin">Exo. 15: 22 25</note> were three dayes in the Wildernesse, and could finde no Water; and then, at the length finding, it was so bitter that they could not drinke of it. In the helpe that he gaue them, wee are to consider, that they so murmured against the Lordes doing heerein, that they did nothing at all deserue to be holpen: but yet neuerthelesse that he did helpe them (shewing <hi>Moses</hi> how to make those waters meete to be drunken) notwithstanding that they so ill deserued the same. That other which depended <note place="margin">Ibid 16.</note> thereon, was, that hereuppon (to strengthen their weaknesse, it seemeth) the Lorde did make a Couenant with them, that if they would indeede bee carefull to please <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> him, they should euer finde him a good and gracious God vnto them. One Station or place there was where they pitched their Tentes, wherein wee doe not read of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <note place="margin">Ibid. 27.</note> such businesse; but rather that they were daintily prouided for (or at least had some tast thereof) euen in that Wildernesse: but in both the next they quickly retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to their bent againe: first for meate, then for Water. In that wherein they mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mured for meate, we are to note how impatiently they did it: and yet, how gracious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Lord dealt with them therein. How impatiently they did it, it appeareth, in <note place="margin">Ibid. 16: 1-3</note> that it is said to be the fault of the whole Congregation: and that they wished ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to haue dyed in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> then to be vnder such a gouernment there. How gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously <note place="margin">Ibid. 4▪ 36.</note> notwithstanding the Lord dealt with them, appeareth likewise partly in that he doth not lay this their sinne to their charge: and partly, in that he doth so readily releeue those their necessities. In that he doth not lay this their sin to their charge, needes must it bee a worke of great mercy, both because the sinne was foule in it selfe: and for that they had before so great experience of his power and goodnesse towardes them. He did also releeue those their necessities so readily, that the selfe-same euening he gaue them abundance of Quailes for that time to satisfie their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire: and the next morning a new kind of sustenance that should continue with them all the while they were in the Wildernesse. In that hee did so readily giue them flesh to their desire, and that same so dainty, and such abundance of that kind, it did suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently shew what hee was able to doe if hee would: and so did leaue vnto them to gather, seeing they had so good experience of his goodnesse towardes them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, that in his whole gouernment of them, he euer did that which in wisedome he knew to be meetest for them. Of the other wee are to consider, first according to the letter: then according to another more secret sense that lyeth therein. Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the letter we are to note; first, that God prouideth for their necessities: then, in what manner he doth it. In that hee prouideth for their necessities, heere in this Wildernesse whether <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="3 letters">

The man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of it doth rest partly on such things as God would do; and partly in such as shold be done by them. Those things that God would do therein, were all concerning the giuing of it: and first, that it was an extraordinary sustenance giuen from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen: then, as touching the times wherein it was giuen, euen euery day, excepting the Sabbaoths. In that it was an extraordinary sustenaunce giuen from heauen, it sheweth, that if the earth should faile to giue conuenient helpe to the Children of God, the heauens should rather make supply, than they should want: or that, if or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary meanes at any time faile, yet are not the extraordinarie thereby excluded. In that he gaue it euery day, it is a good token to all, that euery day is blessed to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> our reliefe: and a warning withall, that we neede not be carefull for to morrowe, when we see that to morrow also is cared for by him. In that hee gaue none on the Sabbaoth, a plaine token it is, how loath he would be we should haue any thing to hinder vs from those better exercises on the Sabbaoths: and if nny be so world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly minded, as otherwise to imploy them to their owne benefit, yet all things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered, or first and last being laide together, their labour therein dooth not pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, the Lord not being (as that day) disposed to giue it. On their partes there were two things to be done: diligent gathering, the one; and orderly distributing the other. For their diligent gathering it was ordained, that all should gather: and so with vs should none be idle, but euery bodie employed, one way or other, in honest and godly labour. And though some of vs be not (by infirmitie, or age, too olde, or too young) so able as others: yet such of vs also should euer bee doing so well as we can; and neuer make that disability of ours in part, to be a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of such idlenesse of ours in the whole. For their orderly distributing of it, it seemeth (as order also doth necessarily in such cases require) that euery com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany was to bring that which they gathered vnto certaine common heapes for the time: and then, that thence should euery one haue his allowance giuen him, which was about our pottle a day for euery one. So that although some could gather much more, and others nothing neere vnto it (as no doubt there were many of both sorts among them) yet must euery one haue so much for his portion, though in gathering, he were not able to reach it: and none must haue more (to the hurt of any: for otherwise, the elder and younger sort among them, needing not their whole allowance, such as needed more might that way be easily holpen) though in their speciall strength and agilitie they had gathered neuer so much. So likewise for vs if God haue blessed any of vs so, that we haue gathered and gotten togither the things of this world in greater aboundance than others haue, we must take heede we thinke not, that we may haue all the same to vs and ours: but that we are Gods Stewards therein to the vse of others; and therefore, that so moderately wee take out what our selues &amp; ours do need, that others also may haue their full allowance with vs. Whereas notwithstanding it is the maner of the godlesse sort, to spend so largely on themselues and theirs, that thereby onely many are very much strait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. The needier sort are not indeede to take it as they list themselues, where it is, as many (it seemeth) are perswaded they may: but those that haue it shoulde, as they are able, supply their want; or otherwise they make themselues answere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for whatsoeuer those others do neede. For which cause, I meane, that they might be more willing so to distribute, it would not keepe wholsome nor sound so much as from one day vnto another: sauing onely where Gods ordinance went withall, as for the Sabaoth, to be spent then; and for that which was reserued for posterity after to see. So the prouision that God giueth vs from yeare to yeare, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> hath but a time; and in that time is to be taken and spent: vnlesse it please God to giue some iust occasion to keepe it longer; and that the necessity of others doo not call it forth sooner. That other more secret sence that lyeth therein, is of that spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall <hi>Manna,</hi> where-with it pleaseth him to feede all that bee his, in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the world: and first what it is that God doth giue; then, what is our dutie therein. The <hi>Manna</hi> that to this end hee giueth, is onely Iesus Christ and his
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:7530:76"/> word: and this <hi>Manna</hi> he giueth, chiefely on the Sabbaoths; but then also on the other festiuall dayes, and exempteth no time from it. Our duty also heerein i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, partly in gathering: and partly in distributing of it. In gathering that we bee diligent and industrious therein: not omitting any Holy-day (so nere as we may) or other good opportunity thereunto; but especially prouiding that nothing hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der vs, but that on the Lords Sabbaoths we wholy attend it. Hauing diligently gathered this <hi>Manna,</hi> then that we do not keepe it in, least so it corrupt; but that carefully we distribute the same as neede requireth: those that haue anie speciall charge to all such as are of their charge; and all others, one to another, by the link of Charity, or Neighbourly dutie. In that wherein they murmured now for wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter againe, we haue else-where occasion giuen to consider som-what further of this, and of some other Stories already mentioned a little before: and so are first to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, of this onely, as it standeth heere by it selfe; then as we are else-where occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioned, both of this and those others together. As it standeth by it selfe heere, we are to consider, first of this their murmuring: then, how God notwithstanding did helpe them. Their murmuring is, that now they are all angry with <hi>Moses;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Exod. 17: 1-4.</note> and, as himselfe complaineth to God, euen ready to stone him: as of his own mind, hauing brought them out thether (though the Text doth plainly say, that they came thither at the commandement of the Lord) to kill them, and their Children, and their Cattle with thirst. God notwithstanding, neuer chargeth them heere, with <note place="margin">Ibid, 5-7.</note> this their sinne (bearing with them belike, as not sufficiently instructed yet) but rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily helpeth them in this neede: giuing them plenty of water out of an harde and dry rocke (as Christ also, as vnlikely to see to, in the iudgement of flesh and blood, to such a purpose, as it vnto this, being strucken by the hand of his Father, and by those that were thereunto ordained, hath yeelded out, in most plentifull maner, the water of life to all beleeuers) and that by the Ministry of <hi>Moses,</hi> with whome they were so offended now. As we are else-where occasioned to consider both of this and those others together, we may note, that the Apostle in such sort speaketh of the Cloud, and of the Sea, of their eating of <hi>Manna</hi> also, and of their drinking of this rock, as that out of the same we may gather two such things as in these our daies do neede to be obserued: one, that seeing the Apostle there speaketh but of two Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments (and yet in the course of speech that then he was in, it had beene to his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to haue spoken of mo, if mo there had beene) it appeareth thereby, that the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> Apostle knew no moe of that reckoning; the other, that if those Fathers could feed on Christ so sufficiently then, so many hundred yeares before hee was come in the flesh, or had a bodie, then is it not so absolutely needful, as the latter church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth vrge it, to conceiue such a bodily receiuing of him as they obtrude al Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome ouer. As touching the safetie of their persons against the enmity of others, by occasion that the <hi>Amalekites</hi> came foorth against them in hostile manner, it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed God so to deale in the ouerthrow of these their first enemies (since they came first out of <hi>Aegypt)</hi> as might be a perpetuall document to them all, for euer after, how in such case to relie vpon him. So are we heerein to consider, first how it pleased God to giue this document to them all: then of some hold that was taken of it. In that course whereby it pleased God to giue them this document to them all, we are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise to bethinke our selues, first of this enmity of theirs against the <hi>Israelites:</hi> then, how they were dealt with for the same. In their enmity, first of their persons: then of their dooings. As touching their persons, they were neere of Kinne to this peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, being descended of <hi>Eliphaz,</hi> the Sonne of <hi>Esau,</hi> the Brother of <hi>Iaacob,</hi> ancestor <note place="margin">Gen. 36: 1, 2, 10, 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

So we also, in the profession of Christ, must looke to haue enemies, of those that in reason should be neere friends vnto vs. Their dooinges were, that vnprouoked they came foorth to fight with them: and smote the hindmost <note place="margin">Exod. 17: 8. Deu. 25: 17, 18</note> and feeble amongst them, when the armie was faint and wearie. How they were dealt with for the same, we haue set downe vnto vs, both for that present time: and for a time long after to come. For that present, first what ordinarie forces were op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed against them: then, what extraordinary course was taken besides. The ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:7530:77"/> forces that were opposed against them, were twelue thousand of them ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed <note place="margin">Exod. 17: 9, 10</note> to the warres; <hi>Iosuah</hi> beeing the leader of them. In the extraordinarie course that was taken besides, we are to see what is was: and how, ioyned with the other, it preuailed. It was but this, that <hi>Moses</hi> with the staffe of God in his hand, together with <hi>Aaron</hi> his Brother, and <hi>Hur</hi> who married <hi>Mary</hi> his sister, <note place="margin">Ibid. 9.</note> would all three (Old men) go vp to the top of the hill: and there woulde <hi>Moses</hi> hold vp that staffe of the Lords in his hand, as the Lordes Standerd, while <hi>Iosuah</hi> with his forces, shoulde encounter with the enemy beneath. At which time it <note place="margin">Ibid. 14.</note> was perceiued, that while <hi>Moses</hi> held vp that Standerd of the Lord, <hi>Israel</hi> preuai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and when <hi>Moses</hi> being olde and weary, did sometimes (to ease himselfe) let it downe, then the <hi>Amalekites</hi> preuailed. For remedy whereof, <hi>Aaron</hi> and <hi>Hur</hi> tooke a Stone, and did set it vnder <hi>Moses</hi> for him to sit vppon; and themselues stept vnto him, on either side one, and help vp his hands till Eeuen: and so <hi>Iosuah</hi> continually preuailed against the <hi>Amalekites,</hi> and bare away the victory of them. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> In that which was done for a time long after to come, we are to note, what it was that in this case was done: and how it may bee farther deriued. That which was <note place="margin">Ibid. 14.</note> in this case done, was, that now at this time God did determine, in time then to come, vtterly to destroy that people from the face of the earth: and therefore wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him, both to set downe the same in record; and besides to make <hi>Iosuah</hi> (who was to gouerne next vnto <hi>Moses)</hi> a liuing witnesse of that resolution. It may bee well farther deriued to all such like, that any time are greeuous to the people of God: yet albeit God do spare them for the time, for causes best knowne to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe; yet do heauy iudgements abide them, and in their time, will vndoubtedly seize vppon them. Though God gaue this document to them all: yet read wee not of any, but only of <hi>Moses,</hi> that tooke hold of it. But he both glorifieth God for the same: and assureth all men, that heauy things abide them for it. He glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifieth God therein, in that thereupon he buildeth an Altar: and dedicateth it, by <note place="margin">Ibid. 15.</note> name, to <hi>The Lord</hi> [the vpholder or aduancer] <hi>of his Standerd.</hi> He assureth al men that heauy things abide them for it, in that he doth so peremptorily deliuer vnto vs, <note place="margin">Ibid. 16.</note> that seeing the <hi>Amalekites</hi> had thus bent themselues to ouerthrowe the Scepter of the Lord (in opposing themselues against those his peculiar people:) therefore the Lord himselfe would haue mortall warre with them for euer, from generation to generation.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To frame the <hi>Israelites</hi> themselues to be an orderly people, first he esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blisheth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> a better forme of ciuill gouernment among them, than as yet they had before: then, he giueth them certaine most holy precepts besides. Hee establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth a better forme of ciuill gouernment among them than they had before, by the aduise of <hi>Iethro Moses</hi> his Father in law: who comming to see him and brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging <note place="margin">Ibid. 18: 1-12</note> with him his wife and his Sonnes, whom he had left behind him when hee went into <hi>Egypt,</hi> and hearing now what great things the Lord had done for them, himselfe also glorifyed God, and there did offer Sacrifice vnto him. So are wee now to note, first in what sort it pleased God to establish this gouernment: then, some other things that are worth the marking withall. It pleased him to establish the same, first by a sound aduise thereof giuen by <hi>Iethro:</hi> then, by a speciall readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in <hi>Moses</hi> to follow the same. In the aduice that <hi>Iethro</hi> gaue, we are to note, first vpon what occasion he did it: then, what was the aduise it selfe. The oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion was, that seeing <hi>Moses</hi> (to so little purpose) to busie himselfe in deciding the causes of the people, and howe the people also were faine so long to attend the <note place="margin">Ibid. 13.</note> deciding of them, all of them comming through his only hands, he perceiued this to be a very simple and troublesome course, and so thought good to admonish him of it. In giuing his aduise we may note, that to the end it might be the better re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, first he maketh some way to that purpose: and then, bringeth in his aduise it selfe. The way that he maketh vnto it, is to shew how defectiue the other was that <hi>Moses</hi> vsed: and that doth he, first by admiration, wondering that euer hee <note place="margin">Ibid. 14-18.</note> would so do (as well he might;) then, by shewing the great inconuenience, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
               <pb n="131" facs="tcp:7530:77"/> the impossibility of it. In bringing in his aduise it selfe; first hee plainely sheweth what himselfe thinketh best: then, in good manner he referreth the same to the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of God himselfe. That which himselfe thinketh best, doth first respect the greatest and waightiest causes: then, other matters of meaner importance. The waightiest causes would he haue him to reserue to himselfe alone: but for those other <note place="margin">Ibid. 19, 20.</note> matters of meanes importance, those would he haue him to put off to others to bee <note place="margin">Ibid. 21-23.</note> decided; but those men would he haue to be well chosen to such a purpose. So that in them it is good more specially to consider, how many subordinate sortes hee would haue of them: and what manner of men he would haue them to be. The sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate sorts of them would hee haue to be foure: some, ouer thousands; others, ouer hundreds; others, ouer fifties; and others, ouer tens. In those qualities or vertues that hee woulde wish them to haue, to whom this businesse should bee committed, wee may note great wisedome in him: hauing as it seemeth, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard first, to such good vertues as without which Men can neuer bee inabled well to deale in such causes at all; then, to one other, without the vvhich, were they for a time neuer so good, they might soone bee quite corrupted. Those good vertues, without which Men can neuer bee inabled well to deale in such causes at all, are, one of them generall to sorts of al causes whatsoeuer: and two of them, it seemeth, more speciall, somewhat more specially respecting some sortes of causes. That which is generall for all, is, that he would haue them to be men of courage: such as would not bee daunted, eyther with the high lookes or vaine ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of the greater sort; nor yet with the difficultie of the businesse it selfe. Those which are more speciall, are two: one, fearing God; the other, giuen to deale true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or (as the propriety of our speech is) vprightly indeede. By the former of which, both causes of Religion would thriue the better: and the Magistrate himselfe would be better preserued (how little soeuer soueraigne authority did see vnto him) from doing any ill. By the latter, matters of common equity and ciuill order should bee well dispatched to the comfort of the good, and weakning of the ill: and the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates themselues should so bee found to gouerne indeede, as others would bee thought that they also doe. That one without which, they would soone degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, or be corrupted, were they neuer so good before, is the hatred of couetousnes: which one vertue, where it is indeede, doth readily stop all the wonted passages to misrule and wrong; and laieth open, a maruellous direct and ready way vnto all good order and right. In that he doth referre the same to the approbation of God, wee are to note; first, that without question he doth it: but then withall, in what manner <note place="margin">Ibid. 23.</note> he doth it. In that he doth it, he doth it both dutifully, and wisely likewise: first, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause God onely is wise, and knoweth best what is meetest for euery one; then also, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> because it might be, that of purpose hee would not (for the time) haue any speciall gouernment among them (as Christ for a time would haue his Disciples to goe forth <note place="margin">Math. 10: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

Luke 22: 35.</note> without any prouision, of such things as they were likely to neede by the way) there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the better to teach them, what he could doe without meanes, and that they were still to depend on him, whether at any time it pleased him to vse such ordinary means or not. In his manner of doing it, we may easily see, that that commeth in, but as it were by the way; and not as any maine or principall part or point of his aduise: which very well might be a straine of Flesh and Bloud; and yet without question he might therein also haue a very good meaning. It might bee some straine of flesh and bloud, for that it is the manner indeede of the Naturall Man (yea, and of the Children of God too, so farre foorth as at any time they are swayed by their owne nature) to make no such speciall reckoning, in ciuill pollicy of Gods direction. Yet might he haue a good meaning in it, for that God, not being the God of confusion, but of order and orderly dealing in all things, he might make no question, but that God had already so farre commended the same vnto vs by instinct of Nature, as that no Religion or duty doth since require, that we should doubt whether it be his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure or not, that we should haue order among vs, vntill hee be specially sought vnto in it. In that speciall readinesse that we finde in <hi>Moses</hi> to follow the same, wee are also to note, not onely that he did it: but also in what manner he did it. That hee did
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:7530:78"/> it, there is no question; the Text is plaine: and it is the manner of all the godly-wise <note place="margin">Ibid. 24-26.</note> with good will to follow, in any of their wayes, whatsoeuer better aduice they find in any. As touching the manner, we do not find, that he inquired first of the Lord, whether he should doe it or not. It may bee implyed; yea, and presumed too: but it is not specially noted. If he did it, then haue wee in him an example of speciall carefulnesse, euen in the plainest matters that are, and such as apparantly carry much greater good with them, yet to inquire of the Lord whether we should doe them or not. If he did it not (which in such case might very well bee) then doth his exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple therein lead vs to this; that in such matters as God hath giuen by instinct of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, we are not to account our selues voyde of his direction, except it be particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly touched in his written word. Those other thinges that are worth the marking withall, are of two sortes: some appertaining to all; one other, but onely to the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. Those that appertaine to all, are two: one, arising out of the whole general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; another, that doth more properly respect some speciall thing heerein contained. That which ariseth out of the whole generally, is, that heere at th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e time was found better direction in that Heathen Man; than in any of the people of God, or in <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> himselfe, that rare and speciall Seruant of God: a good warning to vs, that wee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> despise none whatsoeuer they are; and that euer we keepe with vs that point of wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, in whomsoeuer it pleaseth God to offer any good vnto vs, not to neglect, much lesse to disdaine, in such to take it. That which dooth more properly respect some speciall thing therein contained, is, that heere we may see, that in that Heathen Man there was more wisedome a great deale, to gouerne or set downe good order in it, euen for the people of God themselues, than at this time we find in all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God besides. What a pittifull thing was it, to see <hi>Moses,</hi> to so little purpose, from morning to night so to toyle himselfe and the people of God, to decide such matters as fell out among them: or rather, what a wonder was it to consider, that as yet they had not espyed, how cumbersome and defectiue that manner of proceeding was? But so doe we see in these dayes also, by the Platformes that haue beene at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted by many, and yet are by some, that diuers of those that otherwise haue in the Church of God speciall good guiftes, yet, in matters of Church-gouernment, doe (in good truth) but puzzell about it. That one that appertaineth vnto the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, is, that diuers making Treatises of Religion and religious duties (such specially, as are somewhat out of temper, eyther by the former <hi>Romish</hi> Leauen, or by the late humor of innouation) doe finde no place for the Magistracy or Ciuill gouernment, but onely in the ende of those their Treatises: whereas God, to haue that people of his an orderly people; first, establisheth ciuill gouernment among them; and then giueth his Lawes vnto them. And true it is, both that ciuill gouernment doth well prepare to some kinde of obedience, against the time that the Law of God do come to require the same in more perfect manner; as the posting or squaring of Timber, and the scabling of stone goeth before any perfecter workemanshippe in eyther of them: and that whosoeuer they are that doe not invre themselues to such inferior obedience first, they neuer lightly come to that more perfect obedience after.</p>
            <p n="3">3 When he is about to giue them those other (and those most holy) precepts, we are to consider; first, how he dealeth with them before, about that matter: then, in what sort he dealeth with them in the thing it selfe. Concerning his dealing with them before about it, it shall bee good to note something of it generally first: then afterward, to consider of it more specially. Generally wee may note, that it was such, and so strange, and in such sort carryed and prosecuted by GOD him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, that euen by it onely wee may well perceiue, that nowe, hee was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout some speciall matter: and so consequently, that those preceptes (which wee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> commonly call the <hi>Ten Commandements)</hi> are of very speciall importance, and of wonderfull great moment vnto vs; and very farre vnworthy to bee of so small and slender reckoning, as too too great experience teacheth, that with vs they are. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to consider more specially of it; first, hee will haue a message from him done vnto them: and see what answere they will giue him: and then proceed farther with
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:7530:78"/> them, as occasion shall so be giuen him. In the message that first he will haue done vnto them, we are to consider; first, what the message was: then, what time it was sent vnto them. In the message that hee will now haue done vnto them, wee may note two principall pointes: one, respecting the time past; the other, the time that was to come. That which respected the time past, was, what he had done for them already, in that their great and mighty deliuerance out of <hi>Aegypt:</hi> so the better to mooue them, to haue good regard to that which would be now expected of them. That which respected the time to come, hath two principall braunches: one, what God would haue them to doe vnto him; the other, what recompence hee would vouchsafe them for it. That which God would haue them to doe vnto him, was, well to marke what hee now would haue them to doe: and diligently to doe the same. The recompence that he would vouchsafe them for it, is first set downe (as it were) generally: then more specially. Generally, it was, that although all the Nations of the earth were is, yet they only should be his peculiar people: and so his chiefe treasure, or the most esteemed Iewell of all the World vnto him. More speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, that they should be vnto him a Kingdome of Priestes: and an holy Nation. The time wherein this message was done vnto them, hath a double respect: one, as it is more precisely taken; another, as it is taken more at large. As it is more precisely taken, it sheweth some good reason, why Pentecost (one of their principall Feastes) should be appointed so neere that time, as shortly after this, it was: this time beeing <note place="margin">Exod. 19: 1.</note> the beginning or first day of the third month, since they came out of <hi>Aegypt;</hi> one month and a halfe, or seauen and forty dayes nowe beeing spent already, since they did eate there Pascall there. As it is taken more at large, it is noted to be foure hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and thirty yeares, since God had first taken these and their elders to be his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: a manifest token, and plaine demonstration, that they were not the people of <note place="margin">Ibid. 12: 40. Actes 7: 6. Gal. 3: 17.</note> God for their owne righteousnesse or workes (for as yet he neuer offered to set them a worke, to speake of; not all the whole people generally, nor any of them but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly their first Ancestors in some particulars onely) but onely by the free mercie and goodnesse of God. Whereby we are also taught to gather, that the loue of God towardes vs, whereby he maketh vs his by adoption and grace, is not like the loue of one friend or Neighbour towardes another; it beeing in respect of some friendship or neighbourhood had already or hoped for: but like vnto the loue of Parentes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes their Children, before that euer they see how they will prooue; but then lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> them more, if afterward they prooue to their liking. The aunswere that they <note place="margin">Ibid. 8.</note> gaue heereunto, was very good: namely, that whatsoeuer the Lord should appoint them to do, that would they do. That farther proceeding with them that heereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Lord vsed, is some part of it to giue them to vnderstand what he will shortly doe: and some part againe, to signifie vnto them, what hee would haue done in the meane season. That which he giueth them to vnderstand he will shortly doe, was, that he would come the third day thence, and, from the toppe of <hi>Sinas,</hi> in the sight <note place="margin">Ibid. 11.</note> and hearing of all the people, giue vnto them those precepts or Lawes of his, which he would haue them to obserue and keepe. That which he would hade done among them in the meane season, was part of it to be done by themselues: and part of it, by <hi>Moses</hi> for them. That which was to be done by themselues, was, to be ready against that day, in such manner as becommed them to be: whereof in particular God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe prescribeth some thinges; and <hi>Moses</hi> one other. Those which God doth in <note place="margin">Ibid. 9. 11.</note> particular prescribe vnto them, are, that in the meane season they sanctifie themselues, and wash their cloathes: the former of these directing them, in that meane time to stirre vp themselues to some speciall holinesse (the want whereof in vs is one of the greatest causes, why all this while wee haue so little profited in the word of God;) the latter of them, to come then, euen outwardly also, in the most decent manner they can. That other that <hi>Moses</hi> (but most likely by Gods appointment) deliuereth vnto them, was, that in the meane season they were not to come at their Wiues: a <note place="margin">Ibid. 15.</note> braunch of the former of those that God before required of them; and such as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyeth a very good reason, why though marriage be euer lawful and honourable too, <note place="margin">Ibid. 10, 12, 13, 21.</note> yet at some times it may be inhibited. That which <hi>Moses</hi> was to doe for them, was
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:7530:79"/> to call vpon them for this sanctification: and to set them boundes howe farre they should come. Which sanctification was the same that was of them to be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. In the boundes that were to be set them, and in the straight charge that was giuen them withall, that they should not presume to breake within them, wee may farther note, that as on the one side, we are of duty to goe so farre as the word doth lead vs; so is it very offensiue to God, to presume or presse any farther: and this so much the rather, for that it was required, not onely of the common or vulgar peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; but euen of the choyce and cheefest of them. How hee dealeth with them in <note place="margin">Ibid. 22, 24.</note> the thing it selfe, being now to bee seene, when the third day was come, wee are to note, howe the Lord dealt with them, not onely as it proceeded from the Lord to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them: but also, as afterward it found to worke in them. As it proceeded from <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> the Lord towardes them, we are to make; first, what he did; then, what hee sayde. That which he did, was in effect no more but this, that in fearefull manner hee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared vnto them: and we are therein to consider, both in what manner hee appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren so fearefully vnto them; and to what ende the same may seeme to bee done. The manner of it was, both to their sight: and to their hearing. To their sight, that <note place="margin">Exod. 16: 16, 18, 19. Deut. 5: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

The ende whereunto these thinges were done, way seeme to bee for two principall causes: whereof one is plaine enough in it selfe; the other is not so easily perceiued. That which is so plaine in it selfe, is, thereby to humble them, that so they might the more fruitfully heare that which should bee deliuered vnto them. That which is not so easily perceiued, is notwithstanding plainely implyed, and doth necessarily followe: namely, that if the giuing of the Law at the first be so fearefull, then will the sentence against vnbeleeuers (and much more the execution of it) be much more fearefull, and full of deadly horror ineuitable; and therefore to be in time regarded.</p>
            <p n="4">4 In the thing it selfe, that is, in giuing those precepts vnto them, we may note, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> that in his owne person first he dealeth with them: but that afterward, by occasion, he dealeth further with them most by <hi>Moses.</hi> In his owne person while he dealeth with them; first, he vseth a kinde of Praeface or fore-speech: then, hee giueth those precepts themselues.

Concerning the former, they doe plainely tell vs, that wee must put by all Creatures in Heauen or Earth; and all conceites or opinions of our owne or others: and giue ouer our selues wholy to GOD alone. Concerning the latter, they deliuer the same vnto vs; first, very briefely: then, more <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> at large. Briefly they set it downe to be, to haue him to be our God: and to be our God, is to be all in all. More at large they deuide this our duty, which originally is but one in it selfe, into two principall partes: whereof hee taketh one to himselfe; the other, hee assigneth ouer to our Neighbour, or to the society wherein wee liue. That which he taketh to himselfe, is, that we loue him with all the powers that are in <note place="margin">Ibid. 4-6.</note> vs; vnto which appertaine the three next Commaundements; of which, the first of them doth teach vs what kinde of worship or seruice we must do vnto him, as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> the effect and substance of it; the others doe shew vs, in what manner it must bee performed. For the effect or substance of it, this commaundement dooth not onely shew what it is: but also addeth a reason besides, wherefore wee should vse that, and none other worship to him. It sheweth the effect or substance of it to be, <note place="margin">Ibid. 4, 5.</note> not to worship him as our selues, or others thinke good: but onely, as himselfe in his Word hath appointed. In the reason that he addeth thereto, he sheweth his great <note place="margin">Ibid. 5, 6.</note>
               <pb n="135" facs="tcp:7530:79"/> wrath towards them that otherwise worship; and his greater mercy to those that are careful so to worship, &amp; not to adde any other mixture vnto it: tearming also the one sort of them haters of him; and not allowing any but the others, eyther to loue him, or to keepe his commaundements. As touching the manner, there be two spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall braunches required: one, required by the third commaundement; the other, by the fourth. Both which also doe not onely require the duty it selfe: but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise alleadge some reason for it. The duty that the third commaundement requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, <note place="margin">Ibid. 7.</note> is, that the worship or seruice we do vnto God, be sincerely or truly done: with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Hypocrisie or dissimulation. The reason that he giueth therefore, is, for that the Lord will not holde him guiltlesse, that in his worship beareth any outward ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, otherwise than in wardly he meaneth indeede. The duty that the fourth requireth, is, that it be zealously or feruently done: not coldly, or but of course. To which ende it doth not onely require, that wee remember or haue a speciall care to <note place="margin">Ibid. 8-11.</note> keepe holy the Lordes Sabbaoths: but also sheweth good reasons therefore. It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth to keepe the Sabbaoths holy, that so doing wee may come to such holines and zeale, as whereby we may zealously doe, whatsoeuer worship or seruice it is we doe vnto God: which otherwise we can neuer doe. The reasons are, two of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniency: another, of vtility. Of conueniency, because wee haue the other sixe dayes to our other affayres; and therein to serue our selues first: and because that God hath giuen vs example therein; and, by mentioning the Creation of all thinges then, seemeth to point vs to that duty, that we should take that time to enter into due consideration of those his workes. Of vtility it is, and beneficiall to vs if we can take it, that God hath left his blessing vpon it. That which he assigneth ouer vnto our Neighbour, or to the society wherein we liue, is, that we loue him as our selues; vnto which appertaine two principall duties: one, required by the fift commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; the other, by all the rest ensuing. In the fift commaundement, wee haue likewise not onely the duty that is required: but also a reason to mooue vs thereto. The dutie is, that we so reuerence each other, as that thereby wee knit together in <note place="margin">Ibid. 12.</note> godly vnity. The reason is, that so wee may long enioy the good estate that God <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> doth heere bestow vpon vs. In the residue wee are to note, what is the duty that they require: and, how they would haue vs qualified, that so we may the better doe it. The duty that they require, is, that we carefully vphold the good estate of euery <note place="margin">Ibid. 13-16.</note> one. First, as touching his life, or good estate generally: then, then more special<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; first, as he is coupled with another, that we leaue vnto him his Wedlocke vnde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed: then, as he standeth by himselfe, that we also leaue vnto him his substance vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diminished, and his good name vnblemished. In that which teacheth vs howe wee ought to be qualified to such a purpose, we are to consider; first, what qualification it is, that heereby we are taught to haue to such a purpose: then, of certaine other <note place="margin">Ibid. 17.</note> accidents besides, that are found to haunt the Commandement it selfe. The quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication that heereby is required to such a purpose, is, that wee so content our selues with our own estate for all earthly things, be it neuer so meane, that we neuer so much as in heart couet any better; that so we neither trouble nor preuent any other in his. Those other accidents that are found to haunt this Commaundement besides, are two; one, that it is generally more easily expounded; the other, that it is otherwise by some diuided. In that it is generally more easily expounded, wee had neede so much the more to take heede, that we be not therein deceiued. In that it is by some deuided, it is good to consider; first, that at no time such diuiding of it could bee warranted: then▪ that in these daies it is not vrged but onely vppon a naughty mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. That such diuiding of it could neuer be warranted, we may easily gather, first by the sense of the Commaundement it selfe: then, by another recitall of it. The sense of the Commaundement it selfe (beeing taken at least, as it ought to bee) is cleerely but one: and then the Commaundement cannot be two.

<pb n="136" facs="tcp:7530:80"/> should be the ninth, and whether the tenth: a thing though not absolutely neede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full; yet in diuers good respectes very conuenient. That in these daies it is so vrged, the reason is, for that themselues that so doe, are maintainers of Images, and of godly honour to be giuen vnto them: and for that cause euer lightly leaue out the second Commaundement (as included in the first) because it is so much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them; and then, to make vp the number againe (for they are plainely saide to bee ten) would gladly part the last into two. How naughty a meaning they haue therein, may sufficiently appeare, not onely in this last Commaundement, <note place="margin">Exod. 34: 28. Deut. 4: 13. 10: 4.</note> that they doe so mangle or rent in two: but also in that other, that so they doe not so much include in the first, as they do plainely exclude it from all the whole com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> of them. For what is it that heerein they doe so striue for, but onely for the credite of their Images, and of the worship that they haue taught vs to doe vnto them? A thing, that, put the case it were not forbidden in the word of God (as ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry often, and plainely it is) yet is there none of themselues that doe say, that it is therein required: and then, of no such importance with them neither, but that without hurt it might bee omitted, but that their owne credite might therein bee something touched, for maintaining it so inexorably as they haue; yet for this, must the last Commaundement be so mangled: and the second cleane excluded. In mangling the last, what other place of Scripture haue they, or what one point of Diuinity is there, that thereby they thinke the more to commend vnto vs, or to make more plaine in it selfe? What else is it, but that by tearing it asunder, they hope to get some Clout thereby to couer their nakednesse in the other? In exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the second, they doe in plaine sight a double wrong: one, specially respecting our youth: the other, the whole Church of GOD generally. The wrong that therein they doe to our youth, is, that in these their principles of Religion they leaue the gap so open vnto them vnto Idolatry, by taking that Commaundement away, our selues being so proane thereunto, as by Nature we are generally. That which they doe to the whole Church of God generally, is, in that they defraud it of a very notable and needfull point of Doctrine, by including the second Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement in the first. For the first Commaundement is plaine and pregnant enough in it selfe, that we are to haue none other Gods but him alone: and little needeth that Images should bee, to that ende, so specially mentioned there, which all men (in a manner) doe know (euen those that most esteeme of them) to bee no Gods, but onely representations, and meanes to deriue the worship they meane to such as are represented by them. But an orderly kinde of teaching it is, when first we are altogether directed to God alone; then also, to be taught, that we must worshippe him as himselfe hath appointed, and not with Images, fixions, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceites, or fancies of any braine of man, our owne or others: a needefull doctrine euer to stand in the Church of God; and the very true meaning of that Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement. So that themselues must of necessity graunt (on better aduisement) that those Commaundements must be two: or else, that in one, GOD hath couched or laide together two such maine or principall pointes of duty (and those very diuers) as hee hath not done in any other of the Commaundements besides; but rather for our better vnderstanding, (so to make it plainer to vs) hath diuided one <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> point of duty (as in foure of the last but one) into mo Commaundements.</p>
            <p n="5">5. When afterward, dealing farther with them, by occasion hee doth it most <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> by <hi>Moses,</hi> we are first to consider of the occasion of it: then, of that farther dealing of his with them. The occasion was, for that the people being affrighted with that fearefull manner of giuing the Commandements, did now themselues desire, that God would no more speake vnto them in that fearefull voice of his, least they died, <note place="margin">Exo. 20: 18-21 Deut. 5: 12-31</note> as not being able to beare it: but that he would deliuer his minde vnto <hi>Moses;</hi> &amp; that themselues would be ready to do, whatsoeuer he by his direction, should deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer vnto them. In this it pleased the Lorde not onely to graunt their request vnto them; but also to acknowledge, that therein hee liked very well of them: wishing, that euer there were such a heart in them, to obserue his Lawes: though (for the <note place="margin">Deut. 5: 29.</note>
               <pb n="137" facs="tcp:7530:80"/> most part) they should not haue them deliuered vnto them by himselfe, but by some of his seruants, and such as themselues it may be oft-times, would little like off. And so may we assure our selues, that if we be carefull to obserue and keepe the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements of God, and that by the direction of those that he sendeth vnto vs, he liketh well of such obedience, &amp; our selues may haue good comfort in it: but on the other side, if we professe an obedience to God himselfe and his worde, and yet make little reckoning of those that it pleaseth him to send vs, though it may be we do of others, and would do of these two, but for some infirmity or want that in them we haue (or thinke at least that we haue) espied; yet neither do we please God, neither haue we any sufficient ground as yet, where-on we may hope well of our selues. In that far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dealing that God had with them, we may note, that some part of it was, about this motion of theirs: the residue, about such other things as now he had to deliuer vnto them. About this motion of theirs no more but this, that now accordinglie by <hi>Moses</hi> he dealeth with them; and so in fact confirmeth that order vnto them: a good occasion for vs to gather, first out of this place, how we may account the Lord will teach vs; then, out of a warning of Christ himselfe, how wary notwithstanding we should be therein. The Lord, out of this place we may gather, hath now taken that order once for all, that now hauing condiscended, at their request, to take that order by men to teach vs: neither may wee euer looke that hee will teach vs now by Angels or Saints, apparitions, dreames, or such like; neither may wee euer in the course of our wayes, in such affaires as wee haue to doo, neglect the direction that in them he reposeth for vs. The warning that Christ giueth vs, is to take heede, that neuerthelesse we be not by men deceiued: telling vs withall, that we neede not if we take any heede, for that by their workes or fruits wee may easily know them; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> those workes or fruits that there he speaketh of not being such as are required gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally of all, as godlinesse of life, but such as are propper to them, as their Doctrine or teaching. As also it is not amisse to mark, that God hence-forward vsing the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry of <hi>Moses</hi> onely, is such a thing, as afterward we finde in Christ likewise. For as God heere first gaue the ten Commaundements, which were the effect of all that should follow, and the Touch-stone whereby to try all other Doctrines whatsoeuer, onely by himselfe, and vsed the Ministery of <hi>Moses</hi> in the rest: so Christ also came with the Gospell, and hauing deliuered the same to the world once in his owne per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, doth euer after vse the Ministry of others therein. Both which leaue this lesson to vs: euer to esteeme (as we ought to do) of those that are sent; and yet withall still to haue an eye to the patterne it selfe. About those things that God had now to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer vnto them, it is to be noted, that God called vp <hi>Moses</hi> vnto him twice, farther to informe him in particular about such matters as yet hee had to deliuer vnto him, though in effect he had set downe all, in the Commaundements giuen before: and those were, first how the people should liue together one towards another, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise how their transgressions were to be punished, and are therefore called the Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>cials; then, of certaine principall matters appertaining to the outward worship of God, and so are part of those that are Ceremoniall. In which it shall bee to good purpose, that we first note some-what in this order of their deliuery: then, that wee do more specially consider of those things themselues. In this order of their deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery, no more but this, that seeing God doth first take order for their good carriage one towards another, before he take order for his owne externall worship, it may be to teach vs to gather, that he needing our worshipping so little as he dooth, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counteth it a matter of greater price with him, carefully to nourish loue and good dealing, among our selues. In the former sort of those things themselues, we find, that <hi>Moses</hi> both acquainteth the people with those Lawes; and got them withall (it <note place="margin">Exo. 24: 12.</note> may be partly, so the rather to establish, now at this his first dealing with them, since themselues desired that so it might be, the authority of his Ministry among them) actually to enter into a couenant to obserue the same: and it may seeme, that the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of these two Tables of the Ten-commandements, which soone after were gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, were to be a testification on Gods part, that he also made that Couenant with them; both because it is called the Arke of Testimony, and because that heere (im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:7530:81"/> after the couenant is on their part made) God told <hi>Moses,</hi> that comming <note place="margin">Exod. 25: 22. 24: 12.</note> vp vnto him, he would deliuer him those two Tables.</p>
            <p n="6">6. In the latter sort of those things themselues, we haue but certaine of those <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> that are Ceremoniall spoken of heere: but by occasion of these, it shall be good, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that we haue spoken of the chiefe of these, then to consider somewhat summari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> of the chiefe of the others also. As touching the chiefe of these, namely the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary, and such things as thereunto appertained, we are to note, that as hee was deliuering his minde vnto <hi>Moses</hi> for those matters, for a time his proceeding with them therein was broken-off: but that then he went forward with it again. Vntill the time it was broken off we are to consider, first what was done in the meane sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son: then, of that breaking-off that ensued. That which was doone in the meane season, was, that he tooke order, first how the matter whereof it should bee made, was to be gotten; then, in what manner it should be framed, both it and the things there-unto appertaining. To get in the manner whereof it should be made, the <note place="margin">Ibid. 12-17. and 25: 1 8.</note> Lord called vp <hi>Moses</hi> againe, and willed him to speake to the people to bring him in a free-will offering, such as themselues could giue of their owne accord; and the same to be of such things as should be needfull for the worke, whereof some were of the richest things they had, and others againe almost of the meanest; that so all sorts might giue as they were able, or as their owne hearts could affoord. In what manner it should be framed, both it and the things thereunto appertaining, first he sheweth generally: then, more specially. Generally, according as he should shew him: euen so to make the Tabernacle it selfe, and all things else thereunto appertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. <note place="margin">Ibid. 9.</note> When he declareth the same more specially, the most of his speech is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether of those things themselues: but part of it also of some others thereon depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, or belonging vnto them. In that part of his speech that is altogether of those things themselues, it seemeth by diuers of them, that <hi>Moses</hi> did not deliuer them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together in that same order, in which he receiued them of God; but as his own me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory did serue him: yet that he did it most faithfully notwithstanding; and left out nothing in the end, nor added any thing of his owne thereunto. And, it may bee, that of purpose he left it to <hi>Moses</hi> so to do, to be some protection vnto his seruants, if at any time they or any of them shal by infirmity omit some things in their propper places, or not obserue so perfect an order in their discourses, as some others do and commonly is expected they should. Sure it is, he doth not approoue any confusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, nor alloweth of such as in his matters presumptuously deale beyond their skill, or with prophane negligence or rashnesse, do audaciously dull the eares of their hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, with those disorderly and very fruitlesse discourses of theirs; to no small dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credit of the place they haue taken; yea, &amp; of the matter too that they haue in hand. But yet in this kind, as in many other things besides of speciall moment, no doubt he yeeldeth very speciall fauour and gracious censure, to all those that he hath called thereto, and do vnfaignedly seeke him indeede, though otherwise in profounde or orderly proceeding, they be no way comparable to many others. But as touching <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> those matters themselues, first he giueth order for the place: then, for some thinges to be done therein. Vnder the place we are to comprehend, not onely the site &amp; outward frame or forme of it; but withall, such principall things as were therein; as God himselfe also beginneth with them, and then doth come to the out-warde building: and so are we first to begin with the Tabernacle it selfe; then, to come the Court thereunto appertaining. As touching the Tabernacle it selfe, and first, such principall things as should be within it, we are directed first to beginne with that which should be in the in-most place or that which he called thc <hi>Most-holy:</hi> then, to come to those others that should be in the out-most, called the <hi>Holie,</hi> or the Tabernacle of the Congregation. That which should be in the in-most was the Arke, which he would haue to be a plaine Chest of <hi>Sittim,</hi> a kind of good and <note place="margin">Ex. 25: 10-16.</note> dureable wood, of the quantity of two cubits and an halfe (or an Ell) long, one cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit and an halfe broad, and one cubit and an halfe in depth or height, all ouer-laid, without and within, with beaten Gold: with two rings of gold on each side at the
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:7530:81"/> ends, and barres of the same dureable wood, couered ouer with gold (whereby to beare it) put through the rings, on each side one; and so to continue euer to be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy for the carriage of it: which Chest he ordained for those two Tables of st<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>e, wherein the Ten-Commandements were to be written: and so he gaue charge to <hi>Moses</hi> now, afterward to put them into it. A lid also would hee haue thereunto, <note place="margin">Ibid 17-22.</note> but loose; of length and bredth meete for the chest it selfe, but all of beaten Gold: with two Cherubes, that is to say, Images of men (of the same) reared vp at the ends thereof, at each end one, looking downe towards the midst, and one towards ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; with wings also, and so eatended one towards another, that meeting in the midst, they do as it were couer the lid betwixt them. From which place betwixt their wings (called thereon the <hi>Mercie-seat</hi> and <hi>Oracle)</hi> he also promiseth to speak vnto them, and to giue them answere as neede should require. Of those others that should be in the out-most place, two of them are remembred heere: and one of them a good while after. Those two that are remembred heer, are the Table of <hi>Shew-bread:</hi> and the great standing Lampe or Candie sticke. The Table would <note place="margin">Ibid. 23-30.</note> he haue to be of the same Timber-worke within, but ouer-laide with beaten gold; and but two cubits in length, one in breadth, and one and an halfe in heigth. This Table he would haue to be with a border beneath, to keepe it steddy on the frame, and with a Crowne aboue for ornaments sake: with rings also and barres, as in the other, for the more conuenient carriage of it. The great standing Lamp or Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dlesticke <note place="margin">Ibid. 31.</note> would he haue of beaten golde, to the quantity of one talent (with some things thereunto appertaining:) to spread forth in three seueral branches on eithet side, and so to be seauen in all, fairely wrought, and a Lampe on the top of euerie one. That which is remembred a good while after, is the Altar of <hi>Sweet Perfume,</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> which was to be two cubits high, and one cubit square: of Timber-worke within (as the Tabernacle before) but both it, and the hornes, and the barres to be ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laide with beaten golde. with a crowne or border of golde round about it; and to be placed in the midst next to the vaile of the in-most place, and so, neerer vnto it than either of the other before. As touching the Tabernacle it selfe, first hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth <note place="margin">Exo. 30: 1-6.</note> with the Couerings thereof aboue: and then commeth to the frame it self beneath. The Coueringes were one of them onely for beauty: and the others for necessity. That which should bee for beautie, hee woulde haue to be of fine linnen twisted, and to be faire wrought with Cherubims of imbroidered worke of silke, Blew, Purple, and Scarlet: which should bee of that number and <note place="margin">Exod. 26: 1-6.</note> measure (ten in all; and euery one of them two yards broad, and fourteene long) that being fastned one to another (first by fiues, then those two fiues ioyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by blew silke Laces and Taches of gold) and cast crosse ouer the frame, should couer it cleane ouer, and hang downe towards the earth about halfe the way round about, though some be of opinion, that at the East end, and on both the sides it should hang much lower. Those that were for necessity, were, as it seemeth, all the rest; namely, to beare off the weather: whereof one of them onely is descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed of what proportion or quantity it should be; and the others, but onely requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. That which is described of what proportion or quantity it should be, is the <note place="margin">Ibid. 7-13.</note> next or second: which should be eleuen (fiue of them being coupled together for one parcell, and sixe for another, and then both those ioyned together in one, but these but with taches of Brasse) and thirty cubits long; so to hang downe low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er then the other by one cubit or halfe a yard, round about. That this must bee of Goats haire, belike it was to auoyde the fretting and straining of the in-most that other-wise might easily haue bin by either of the other that were aboue it. Those <note place="margin">Ibid. 14.</note> others that are but onely required, and not described, were two: one, of Rammes skinnes coloured red, the other, of the skinnes of Taxes or Badgers. But these by likely-hood should obserue the proportion of the latter: and so couer the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle round about within two yards of the earth, though some conceiue them to come neerer to the ground on the West end, and both the sides. The frame <note place="margin">Ex. 26: 15-25.</note> beneath (the strength of the whole) was to bee erected of certaine plankes made fast together, and so to be as it were the walles of the house. Concerning which
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:7530:82"/> we are to consider, first of the frame it selfe: then, of the parting, and closing of it. The frame it selfe consisted of eight and forty plankes of that afore-saide good and <note place="margin">Ioseph.</note> dureable woode, all of them of the length of ten eubits, and about foure inches thicke; and all, but two, of one bredth also, euery of them being one cubit and an halfe broad. Of two of them there is some question for the forme and bredth of <note place="margin">Lyra.</note> them, some of them accounting these to be a great deale narrower than the other: and the Text it selfe doth in deede set them downe by themselues, as to close vppe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
               <note place="margin">Ibid. 24. 23.</note> the Corners on the West; yet not to be differing from the other in measure. But the oddes is no more but this, that if they bee not of much lesse measure than the others, the frame it selfe cannot be but some-what more than the third part of it in breadth, to that which it is all in length, which is the proportion which they do conceiue that it should holde: whereas on the other side, if they were all of one measure and forme, then would it fall out, to be sixe yards broade, for fifteene in length, whereas they would haue it but fiue. How be it, besides that the Text setteth downe no other measure for them, than for the other, it dooth plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point as many sockets to them as to the other: which woulde not keepe so good proportion. For so those two borods, which according to their opinion should be but halfe a cubit and foure inches broad, which according to our reckoning, were but one foote and an inch (and so but onely one third of the others) shoulde haue two Tenons on them, and two Sockets thereunto appertaining, as well as the others which were seauen and twenty inches broad, or (as we reckon) one yard and three inches: an vnequall proportion. But for any thing that I see to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, those two boords or plankes that are seuerally mentioned in the Text, and thereby alotted vnto the corners, may very well be of another forme, than any that yet I see haue conceiued: both by the nature of the worke; and by the wordes of the Text it selfe in the Originall. That other forme is, that either of them should be a right Angle; altogether of the same measure with the others: but one halfe of it plying to the end, and the other to the side of the whole frame. And each of these might be either an entire peece of it selfe, hewn out of purpose to that vse: or made of two sides well fastned together. With the nature of the worke I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue it may well stand, because so it would be (as I do take it) much better to the strengthening of the whole (and that, in the Text, is much respected) than if they were two seuerall parcels. If we come to the words of the Text it selfe in the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall, there be two principall words that present themselues most to our conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and do both seeme to import the sence that I speake of. My selfe haue lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle skill therein: but it may suffice to this purpose, if I can so expresse my meaning, as that I may propound it to others that are better furnished, that they may consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der more fully of it. The former of those words is <hi>Tomim,</hi> which with vs is interpreted <hi>Ioyned;</hi> signifying that they were to be ioyned together: and yet not speaking of ioyning these two corner boords that there are spoken of; but of ioyning each of themselues together in one, aboue and beneath, or to make them fast together throughout. Which may seeme to import that which we speake of: at least, that way they are best ioyned together to the strengthening of those parts <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> of the Tabernacle whereunto themselues were to be ioyned; the one, at the one corner, the other at the other. But now the propriety of the word, as <hi>Santes Pag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninus</hi>
               <note place="margin">In Epis. The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>. ling. sanct.</note> doeth interpret it, proceedeth farther; namely, to signifie, that these two boards should be <hi>Twins;</hi> not each to other, but in themselues. And thereunto ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord <note place="margin">Ari. Mont. Trem. &amp; Iun.</note> our best interpretations since likewise; which being granted, it is plaine in it selfe, that they can be as <hi>Twinnes,</hi> in no other sence, so well as in this. The other word is, that which is interpreted a <hi>Ring:</hi> and that is so interpreted not only by our vsuall translations and those of the best; but also by the <hi>Hebritians</hi> themselues that before I named. How be it <hi>Santes Pagninus</hi> openeth the way to a better interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation as I do take it, if he be well marked. For first setting downe the root whence that word commeth, <hi>Tabagh,</hi> among other significations thereof, he sheweth that one of them is to <hi>Fasten</hi> or make steddy: and then comming to this deriuation of it, which we so commonly interpret to be a <hi>Ring,</hi> which is <hi>Tabaath,</hi> as he
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:7530:82"/> granteth that it is vsed for a Ring; so he addeth withall, <hi>Quod digito infigatur sic ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellatus:</hi> that is, therefore so called, for that it is fastened vnto the finger. So it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth thereby, that the substance (as it were) of the sence that belongeth to this, is to <hi>Fasten</hi> or to be <hi>Fastened:</hi> and that a <hi>Ring</hi> hath no place heere, but onely so farre as it might <hi>fasten.</hi> But that we see plainly, may the more firmely be doone by the other: and therefore that other (as I do take it) may seeme the rather thereby to bee meant. Whereunto we may adde, that, where as these Corner-boordes also were to haue two sockets a peece as well as the others (which with any good proportion they could not haue if they were so narrow as others would make them) in this sence that now wee speake of, each returne of each boorde hauing one, they answere with the other as fitly as may bee. But by this meanes the Tabernacle would be three parts of a foote, or which is all one, nine Inches longer than iust fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene yards, and euen so much broader than fiue: but neither is there any thing that I do finde in the word against; and the Curtaines or Coueringes (euen the least of them all) are large enough, in comely maner, and proportionably to couer the same, and the vtmost of them sufficient withall, by their sidenesse to stay both them-selues and the in most from the force of all weather. All which boordes or plankes were appointed to haue at their neather ende both Tenons and Sockets, of each sort two: and their Sockets are by others (and that with good probability) conceiued to haue beene sharpe beneath, so to sticke fast in the ground. But whereas those planckes were all to be ouer-laide with beaten Gold, all ouer, and so might seeme to bee all of Golde, all their Sockets were but of Siluer: a baser Mettall; yet so <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> much the more sutable to be thrust so farre into the earth, as should be needefull to take some reasonable good hold, as to such a frame should be needefull. Besides which their fastening into the earth, they had other helpes also of strengthening the whole frame together: some, set downe in the Text it selfe; others conceiued. Such as are set downe in the Text it selfe, are those Bars and Rings that there are spoken of: whose manner of placing is notwithstanding otherwise conceiued, than the Text may seeme to describe it. For by the Text it is cleere, that the Bars <note place="margin">Ibid. 26-30.</note> must bee fiue, of Timber worke also, but ouer laide with beaten Gold: and that there should be Rings of Gold in the Boordes, conueniently placed for those Bars to passe thorough; so to hold the whol the better together. And so it might seem thereby, that those Barres should bee some-what better than fifteene yardes long, and about one foote, so many of them as were for the sides, which were ten; and the rest fiue and about one foote, which were for the end: and that one of them should go through the heart of all those plankes, edge-long, and in the middest of them, by holes that were made through them for that purpose; and that the other foure should go through but by the Rings on the out-sides only, two of them aboue the midmost of them, and two beneath, in conuenient and equall distance. But now others conceiue, that onely one of the fiue on euerie side, was so long as to go <note place="margin">Rab. Sal. Lyr Tremel. Iunius.</note> through the whole, and that it went not through the heart of them neither, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the Rings without: as also that the others were but of halfe the length of the former, and that meeting together in the middest, and the one beeing let into the other, two of them made as it were but one, and so seemed to be but only one aboue, another beneath, and three in all. Those other helpes which are conceiued, which the Text doth not so plainly set downe (and yet some do seeme thereon to gather it) were as it were certaine Staples aboue (others call them also Rings) of Golde to be let into the boords or plankes at the top, by certaine holes or mortases to that end prouided: so that one foote of the Staple should be let into one boord towards the edge of it, and the other into that which was next vnto him; so the better to keepe them all fast at the top together. And so this frame being thus set vppe, was at the East end altogether open as yet, and so all the top: but other-wise close euery whit of it, within and without, barres and all, all of beaten Gold to see too, sauing one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that rew of Sockets or bases which were beneath, which also was very sayre and sightly, and yet those but of siluer. As touching the parting and closing of it, it was diuided into two principall parts, leauing ten cubits of it vnto the West, and the
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:7530:83"/> rest vnto the East: of which two the greater was called the Tabernacle of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> or the Holy, and the lesser the most holy place. And the diuision heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of <note place="margin">Ibid. 31-35.</note> was made, not by such plankes as whereof the Tabernacle was reared, but onely by a faire and rich hanging, hung on foure pillers of Timber, couered with gold, and standing on foure sockets or bases of Siluer, for that onely purpose ordained. Closed vp in like manner it was not by plankes as the residue of it, but onely by a faire han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging <note place="margin">Ibid 36, 37.</note> hung on fiue pillers couered with Gold as afore, but these hauing their sockets but onely of brasse. As touching the Court wherein it stood, it was an hundered cubits long, and fifty broad: so that the Sanctuary being reared vp towards the East <note place="margin">Exod. 27▪ 9-15</note> end of it, might leaue about two parts of the breadth of it, or twenty cubits space be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt it and the farre end, and both the sides; and the whole East halfe of the court to the seruice and businesse that was there to be done. But whereas it could be but fifty cubits square that was so left, and had some things besides to be placed therein, thereby it may seeme, that God did not meane that little roome to the whole Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, neither did looke that it would bee much frequented by them. It was <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> taken in by twentie pillers at a-side, and ten at an end: and hung about with twisted linen, fiue cubits high, on those pillers aforesaid; sauing onely at the East end where the entrance was, for twenty cubits space in the midst, which was to be supplied with a fairer and richer hanging than it, on foure of the middlemost pillers. Where againe it is good to marke (and that so much the rather, because I doo not finde it noted by any other) that whereas it is so plainly set downe, of what length the hangings must be (namely, one hundred cubits on each side, fifty at one end, and thirty at the other, besides that supply of the richer hanging making out the length of the other) it doth <note place="margin">Ibid. 16.</note> seeme to shew vs, that the number of the pillers is to be taken not to the full number that may seeme to be there required, but to want foure of them: yet euer leauing twenty at each side, and ten at each end; accounting euerie corner piller both one of those that are for the side, and one of those that are for the end. For so wil those han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gings <note place="margin">Ibid. 18.</note> be fit: which otherwise would be very short if four pillers moe were in like di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance placed therein, whether in the sides, or at the ends, or howsoeuer. All which pillers were to be of Timber-worke, of that good and dureable wood, whereof the <note place="margin">Ibid. 17.</note> other things also were made: all of the measure of fiue cubits in height; and both furnished with brazen sockets or bases beneath, and adorned or beautified with Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer hookes and fillets aboue. The hangings also that were hung thereon, were of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> the breadth of fiue cubits, of twisted Linnen: and as some are of opinion, in worke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manship <note place="margin">L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

The principall thinges that were in this Court (besides the Sanctuary it selfe) were two: the Altar, and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer. The Altar hath his measure and making set downe, as that it should bee of Timber-worke likewise, of the same good and dureable wood of <hi>Sittim,</hi> fiue Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits in breadth and length, and three high, hollow within, <note n="*" place="margin">Exo. 27: 1-8 Ex. 30: 17-21.</note> and hornes ar euery cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of it: but all couered with brasse. Within it also should it haue a grate of Net<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worke all of brasse whereby the ashes might fall downe as neede should be, and not choake the fire: and all the instruments thereunto appertaining of brasse likewise; but the Barres whereby to beare it to be no more but couered with it, and not to bee all of the mettall it selfe. The Lauer hath not his measure nor making set downe, but to be all of brasse, both the head and base thereof: and that the brazen altar be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing first placed in conuement distance before the Sanctuary, then should this Lauer be likewise placed behinde the Altar, betwixt it and the Sanctuary; and that <hi>Aaron</hi> and his sonnes for the time being (and such others as should succeede them in the Priest-hood) should there wash (and yet, as it seemeth, when they had already offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red their sacrifice before, so precisely woule God haue vs to acknowledge our great vncleannesse before him, euen when wee haue most deuoutely worshipped) both hands and feete, before they should enter into the sanctuary, on paine of death. As touching those thinges that heer he mentioneth that he would haue done therein; first we are to consider, of those by whom he would haue them done: then, of the thinges that should bee done by them. In those by whom hee would haue them
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:7530:83"/> done; first, who they should be: then, how they should bee thereunto appointed. They should be <hi>Aaron</hi> and his foure Sonnes (so farre as yet it pleaseth him to make <note place="margin">Exod. 28: 1.</note> mention of any: and those that were afterward called besides, hee would haue to be inferior to these) <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihn,</hi> and <hi>Eleazar,</hi> and <hi>Ithamar:</hi> for these it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed him to will <hi>Moses</hi> to call vnto him for this purpose; namely, to serue him in the Priest-hood. How they should bee thereunto appointed, that wee may the better perceiue, we are to consider: first, what their furniture must bee: then, how they should be entered into their office. Their furniture must bee certaine faire and beautifull Garmentes (especially for <hi>Aaron</hi> himselfe; and partly also for his Sonnes besides:) but some of them common to all; and some more proper to certaine of them. Common to all, were some without question: but one there is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> whereof may be some question made. Of those that were out of question, some were for their bodies; and one for their heades. For their bodies a couple: one, a plaine Linnen Garment vnder their other apparell; the other, a faire Girdle aloft on their Cloathes, to tye them together. That which they had to weare vnder <note place="margin">Ibid. 42, 43.</note> their other apparell, was to couer them round about, from their loynes or wast, downe to their knees: that so their nakednesse, in that their businesse, might ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer be seene, though at any time their other clothing, eyther by the winde or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther casualty, as they should doe their businesse there, should fly open, as such kind of loose apparell may oft-times easily doe. For their heades, they were to haue <note place="margin">Ibid. 35, 40.</note> (after the manner of the people of the East, as the <hi>Turkes</hi> and others vse yet) Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters or Bonets faire and beautifull, and to haue them on in the time of their mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration: not beeing any token of reuerence with them, to vncouer their heades, as it is for men among vs: but vsing to expresse it by stooping or bowing of theyr bodies, lesse or more to those that they reuerence (according as their meaning is to shew themselues dutifull vnto them) and sometimes to prostrate themselues flat on the ground. That whereof there may bee some question made; is the vpper Garment of the inferior Priestes, which was but of Linnen, but as it seemeth very faire, and that there was good workemanship thereon bestowed: but the question is, whether this were all one with that neathermost Garment of <hi>Aaron,</hi> which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so was of Linnen. For some there be of opinion it was; and yet the Text in mine <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ioseph. ant. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 8. <hi>Lyr.</hi>
               </note> opinion, is rather against them. For whereas it is plaine, that they shoulde bee their vppermost Garments, and that of <hi>Aarons</hi> the nethermost to him; and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as <note place="margin">Exod. 28: 40.</note> it specially set downe of their Bonets, that they should be of speciall beautie: it may probably be thought, that the Text doth import them to be much fairer than the in-most Garment of <hi>Aaron,</hi> of which there is no such charge giuen, and for that so they would be more sutable to those Bonets of theirs withall. More pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to certaine of them were those that were appointed for <hi>Aaron,</hi> farther than those that he had common with them: which were first in his apparell; then also, in other ornaments besides. In his apparell he had not onely a Linnen Garment, as had the others: but also had two others besides. His Linnen Garment was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broydered, <note place="margin">Exo. 28: 4. 39. <hi>Tremel. Iunius</hi> Exo. 28: 31-35</note> or of Checker worke, as others doe reade. Of the other two, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most was of Violet or Purple colour, and the same of Silke, as it seemeth, and some doe read: vppon the skirts whereof should hang the likenesse of Pomegra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, and Bels of Gold intermingled together: the one, to teach how full of fruit, <note place="margin">Esay 46: 13. 56: 1. 61: 10, 11 Col. 2: 3, 9, 10.</note> (or nothing but fruite) our High-Priest is: and how fruitfull we also should be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him: and the other howe vnpossible it is, but that hee should earnestly cry to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="L"/> God his Father in al his intercession for vs, in all the daies of his ministration; and <note place="margin">Heb. 5, 7.</note> how we should doe the like for our Bretheren also, euery one as hee hath charge. That other Garment of his, was very costly and faire: of fine twined Linnen, <note place="margin">Exod. 38: 5-8.</note> Silkes and Gold, of diuers colours, richly imbroydered, shorter and closer than the other. The ornaments that hee had besides, were two: one annexed to this his vpper-most Garment; the other, vnto that his Bonet.

And this, so much the better to teach, that they could not so load that Iewell of <hi>Aarons</hi> with beauty and workemanship, but that the High-Priest that was to come, should come much more replenished with the truth indeede: and that those two from him should descend (to all that are his) in plentifull measure.

And the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection that God gaue for both these, was in effect all one: namely, that eyther of them should bee most perfectly and exquisitely made; and that neyther of them <note place="margin">Ex. 30: 22-38</note> should be in any other vse among them, nor any such made by any. As the trueth is, that there is none but Iesus Christ, in whom we can be made acceptable or sauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to God: and in him, so many as truely rest in him, are most redolent and sweete vnto him. That part of his speech that is of some other thinges, thereon depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding or belonging vnto them, resteth in two principall pointes: one, that hee had <note place="margin">Exod. 31: 1-11</note> furnished men with skill to worke those thinges that hee required (he fayleth not in the like in these dayes also;) the other, that neuerthelesse in all this busines (Church-worke though it were, as we doe tearme such like sometimes) they mlght neuer for <note place="margin">Iibd. 12-17.</note> it breake any of his Sabbaoths, but diligently obserue them all. A manifest admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition to vs, that God will in no wise allow many of those thinges that wee doe on his holy Sabbaoths, wherein wee notwithstanding thinke our selues very excusable. Of all which when the Lord had deliuered his mind vnto <hi>Moses,</hi> then also hee gaue <note place="margin">Ibid. 18.</note> him the two Tablets of stone, wherein himselfe had written the Ten-Commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to take them downe with him.</p>
            <p n="7">7 Concerning the breaking of that ensued, wee are first to see what it was: then, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> how it was pacified, and made vp againe. Going about to finde out what it was, we are first to note, what was the occasion of it: then to consider of the thing it selfe. The occasion of it, was that long absence of <hi>Moses:</hi> though about Gods businesse, <note place="margin">Exod. 32, 1. 19 19. 24: 12, 24.</note>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and their owne; and though hee had sufficient Deputies among them in that his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence. The thing it selfe we finde partly in them; partly in the Lorde: in them, that they committed a foule sinne; in the Lord, that hee was highly offended with them for it. Their sinne proceeded most from themselues: but yet partly, from <hi>Aaron</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so. From themselues it proceeded, that they would needes haue such a visible repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation made: yea, though it were to a speciall charge vnto themselues; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly <note place="margin">Exo. 32: 1, 3, 6</note> worshipped, when they had obtained. From <hi>Aaron</hi> likewise, that though <note place="margin">Ibid. 2, 4, 5.</note> he required such Iewels of them (and as it may seeme, the rather to stay them) yet, on their so doing he yeelded, made an Altar for it, and appointed the next day to be holy vnto it. The Lord heereuppon was so offended with them, that first telling <hi>Moses</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ibid. 7-10.</note> how ill they they had done; he then telleth him also, that he saw very well, that they were but a naughty people: and therefore not amisse, vtterly to destroy them; and to rayse vp a mighty people of him. The pacification or making vp of this breach a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, was presently attempted: but could not bee as yet obtained. So are wee to consider; first, howe it was in the meane season attempted: then, howe it was in
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:7530:85"/> the end obtained. Attempted it was first at this present: then afterwarde also. At this present, before he departed, he earnestly besought the Lord for them: and pleaded on his owne glory, and former promise. Before he did assay it with the <note place="margin">Ibid. 11-13.</note> Lord againe, he first himselfe made some good way to obtain: then after, he assay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it againe. He made some good way first to obtaine, both that he was himself so grieued with it: and that he did so punnish it also. Himselfe was so grieued with it, when he saw indeed what was done, that he cast away the Tables &amp; brake them: <note place="margin">Ibid. 15-19.</note> either not witting for griefe what he did; or condemning them as vnworthy of so holy a Law, who now had so fowly broken the same. In punnishing of it, he first <note place="margin">Ibid. 20, 29.</note> destroyeth the Idoll it selfe with great detestation, making them to drinke of it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so: and then roundly reproouing <hi>Aaron</hi> for his facility therein, nothing sparing him for that he was his elder Brother, on the others that most offended hee did a good execution besides, to the number of about three thousand persons. This way being made, and the people (as it may seeme) beeing now brought to some profession of repentance for it, he goeth vp to the Lorde againe, to see what might <note place="margin">Ibid. 30-35. and 33: 1-3.</note> be done: but could not obtaine. At this time it seemeth he alledged that profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the peoples repentance, because the Lord doth now (as it were) take excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion against it. For hee willeth them to lay aside their costly rayment: as if hee <note place="margin">Exod. 33: 5.</note> should more plainly say vnto them, that their vsing of it still did plainely shew that there was no repentaunce in them. A needfull lesson for vs also, for that such trim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming vp of our selues doth plainely shew, that then wee haue good liking of our selues: whereas true repentance doth euer carry with it a speciall great dislike of our selues; as nothing worthy to bee so cherished. Whereupon <hi>Moses</hi> comming <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
               <note place="margin">Ibi. 7-11, 4, 6.</note> downe to the people againe, now remoueth his Tent from among them (as we also should put a speciall difference in all such cases:) and the Lord appeareth famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly vnto him. Which sight, as it seemeth, so wrought with the people, that now they repented better, and laide aside their costly apparrell. Obtained it was not all at once, but by degrees: first, that they should not be destroyed; then, that him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe would also go with them. That they should not be destroyed, was obtained <note place="margin">Exod. 32: 14</note> by <hi>Moses</hi> at his first intercession for them, before he came down from the mount. The next day also, at his second request, he obtained, that they might go on for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <note place="margin">Ibid. 30-35. and 33: 1-3.</note> as they had begunne; and that he would send his angell, with them: but yet would he remember them, as occasion should serue, for that their transgression. But now the third time, when the people did better repent, and <hi>Moses</hi> renewed his suite againe, it pleased the Lord to promise to do it; and to giue him some to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of it, such as himselfe did then desire: but for a time, it was no more but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to <hi>Moses;</hi> but afterwarde performed vnto the people. While it was but promised to <hi>Moses,</hi> first we haue that which concerneth this matter it selfe: then, that farther confirmation that was giuen him besides. That which concerneth the matter it selfe, is, that <hi>Moses</hi> againe intreated for it; and that the Lord was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated <note place="margin">Ibid. 33: 12, 17</note> by him: willing him then to prouide two other such Tables as hee had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, promising againe to write the Commandements in them; and him-selfe next <note place="margin">Exo. 34: 1-3.</note> morning alone to be with him, meaning him then that farther confirmation that he desired. Which farther confirmation was a farther manifestation of himself vnto <note place="margin">Ibid. 18: 23. and 34: 4-8:</note> him, which accordingly he did vouchsafe him. When it was to bee imparted vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the people, <hi>Moses</hi> first againe remembereth the Lord about it: and the Lorde againe telleth him, that he will not faile to do it; but yet looking that the people <note place="margin">Ibid. 9. 10.</note> should in like sort yeelde in some other duties to him likewise. The duties that God did now require of them, were but some of those againe which he did inioyn them before, and whereupon he made with them the former couenant: nowe not charging them with any new; and contenting himselfe at this time, but vvith few of those. And if we marke, they all are such, as wherein it is euident, that it vvas not so much any seruice to him, as their owne good estate that he respected there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. For first he requireth, that vvhen they come into the land which he was now about to giue them, they should for their ovvne, sakes ridde it of that corruption, which they should finde in it vvhen they came thither: then he directeth them, in
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:7530:85"/> what sort themselues should liue therein, so to enioy the benefit of that his fauour now recouered to them againe. As touching the former, he giueth them to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, <note place="margin">Ibid. 11-16.</note> that himselfe doth meane to make a cleane riddance of the ancient inhabitants of the Land: and therefore willeth them, that they on their parts also take heed, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> they make no couenant with them; but vttetly to destroy those Idolles of theirs, and the whole manner of that their worshipping. The reason to be, for that other-wise, themselues also might sometimes be inuited and feast with them in their Idoll-fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stings; and that taking their Daughters in marriage, they might so corrupt their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren: whereas they ought to worship none but him; and hee being a iealous God, they could not so do, but to their owne ouer-throw. As touching the latter, two things there are that he doth forbid: all the rest he doth require. Hee forbiddeth <note place="margin">Ibid. 17, 26.</note> them to haue any Gods of mettall: and to be, either so vnthankefull towardes him, or so intemperate in themselues, as when they are to giue their first-linges vnto him, they obtrude them vnto him when they are too young; or when they would fare more daintily, they wantonly eate of such things, before they be meete to be eaten. Those that he requireth, do all tend to this end, that they be dutifull worshippers of him: and that, first in such festiuall times as hee had appointed vnto them; then, in yeelding vnto him some part of that, where-withall it pleased God to blesse them. The Festiual times that before he had appointed vnto them, and which now hee did require, were first the Sabbaoth: then, those three principall Feasts of the yeare be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides. His Sabbaoths he would hane them so duely to keepe, that he woulde not haue them to meddle with them, neither in their seede time, nor haruest. Those <note place="margin">Ibid. 21.</note> other three Feasts he doth likewise require to bee duely obserued, promising also to preserue their Coasts in the meane season; and farther, giueth more special direction <note place="margin">Ibid. 18, 22-25</note> for the first of them: Namely, that they vse no leauen then; nor leaue ought thereof till the morning. As touching that where-withall it pleased him to blesse them, he doth now againe require, that they yeeld some part thereof vnto him: both the first<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings that before he required; and some-what besides when they came to worship. For their first-lings he would haue the first, not onely of their Cattle, and fruites of <note place="margin">Ibid. 19. 20, 25</note> the earth (and the vncleane, to be redeemed with a cleane:) but euen of their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren too. That which besides he required when they came to worshippe, was, that <note place="margin">Ibid. 20.</note> euerie one should giue some-what: yet not prescribing any thing vnto them; but leauing it wholly to their owne discretion. On these conditions (which also him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe <note place="margin">Ibid. 27.</note> willed <hi>Moses</hi> to set downe in writing) how fully the Lord did yeelde to be their good and gracious Lord againe, himselfe declared, both by renewing those Tables <note place="margin">Ibid. 28.</note> againe: and by cloathing <hi>Moses</hi> with so speciall glory now. In those new Tables that were now prouided, againe hee wrote the Ten Commaundements: and gaue them to <hi>Moses</hi> to the vse of the people. <hi>Moses</hi> also he cloathed now with so spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> glorie, that they were not able to behold the brightnesse of his countenaunce, (though vnwitting to him) but fled away from him: till hee, espying what was the <note place="margin">Ibid. 29, 35.</note> cause, cast a vayle on while hee talked with them. And truely, the glorie of his true Seruaunts, is alwayes great, though hee make it not so to appeare vnto others.</p>
            <p n="8">8. This breach being thus made-vp againe, and the worke that was in hand <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> before, being now to proceede, <hi>Moses,</hi> according as now he had receiued direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions already, first, setteth in hand to get all those things ready that God required: and then, doth reare, or set vp the same, as he also appointed. To get those things ready, first he prouideth against a daunger that the people (by putting their handes vnto) might easily incurre by immoderate zeale, if they were not before admonished of it: and then requireth that they also would be helping therein, so farre as to them should be appertaining. He prouideth against that daunger, when as now beeing to require of them, both themselues to bring in such things as were needfull, and to helpe to worke them besides (so many of them as should be found able so to do) he first requireth, that neuerthelesse the Sabbaoth be duly obserued of them all: which <note place="margin">Exod. 35: 1-3.</note> otherwise themselues might haue thought had not beene so precisely to be kept, but
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:7530:86"/> that in such worke as this, euen by the nature of the worke it selfe (being to erect a Sanctuary vnto him) or at least, for the more speedy dispatch of it, they might on their Sab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

As tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the thing it selfe, first let vs see how it was performed: then, because it was a worke of speciall moment. therefore it shall not be amisse, that we againe consider some-what farther of it. For the performance of it, vnto the direction that GOD had giuen to <hi>Moses</hi> before, in what sort to set vp and place all thinges thereunto ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaining, he addeth now speciall pointes moe: one, for the time; another for one point of the manner of it. For the time, he appointeth that it be done the first day of the first moneth of the second yeare since they came out of <hi>Aegypt:</hi> which <note place="margin">Exo. 40: 1-8.</note> was as the first day of March with vs; and so some-what within the yeare, after that great deliuerance of theirs. That one point that respecteth the manner of dooing it, was, that hauing reared it and set all things in order, then was he to annoint both <note place="margin">Ibid. 9-11.</note> the Tabernacle it selfe, and the things there unto appertaining, with the brazen Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar and Lauer without, &amp; the Instruments thereunto appertaining, with that sweet &amp; holy Oyle, which God had caused him to that end to prouide: a very good assurance to vs, that not only the Church in general, &amp; the chiefe &amp; principal members therof; but euery member in particular also, euen the meanest of al, are by faith in christ made acceptable and sanctified to God the father. And whereas not only the place it self, &amp; the things therunto appertaining were by Gods ordinance thus anointed; but <hi>Aaron</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ibid. 12-16.</note> also &amp; his sons, when they were washed and revested to enter into their holy function (the Priest-hood being but only a figure of the Priest-hood of Christ, and the Vertue and power of it being onely in Christ) hence also may we gather, that in the Priest-hoode of Christ alone, all that beleeue haue so full attonement with God, that they neuer neede to seeke to any other helpe whatsoeuer. Now, if our selues thinke good to consider any farther of this speciall and beautifull worke of God, being without it, we see nothing else but onely a small quantity of ground taken in: and the vpper part of a building (flat in the roofe, and in colour gray) reared <note place="margin">In length▪ 100 cubits: in breadth, 50.

Which Linnen han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gings we finde to be hung on fayre Pillers of wood, of conuenient distance betwixt; hauing their bases or feete of Brasse, and by those pitched into the earth: but their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> hookes where on those hangings were hung, to be of Slluer; and the heads, of those Pillers also to be beautifully garnished with siluer besides. And that these might stand more steddy, we finde those pillers to be stayed vp on euery side likewise, with corde (after the manner of pitching Tents) and all the pinnes, together with the Mals to driue them in, and to knocke them out, to be of Brasse also. This enclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure or new-in-take we finde to bee coasted, the sides towardes the North and the South; and the ends towards the West, and East: neyther do we finde any entrance thereunto, but onely at one end of it, and that on the East.

Which, as it seemeth, yeelded vnto men two places of entrie: One, on the right hand, betwixt those two hanginges, the richer and the meaner on the North; the other, on the left hand towards the South, at the other end of this rich hanging. When we are come in, then do we see the Sanctuary it selfe, erected to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the farther end of the Court; but some things to be placed betwixt vs and it: and those to be two. One, the brazen Altar, some reasonable distance on this side <note place="margin">Exod. 27▪ 1-8. 38: 1. 40: 6, 29 Ibi 30: 17▪21. 38: 8. 40: 7, 30▪</note> of it: the other, the brazen Lauer a little beyond it, betwixt the Sanctuary it selfe and the Altar. Then drawing neere to the Sanctuary it selfe, if we take the course to walke about it, to see the out-side of it, there wee finde roome, betwixt the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side of the Court and it, somewhat better than eight yards broad on both the sides of it, and so belike at the West end also: saue ostely so farre as the Cords and pinnes that holde vp the pillers, do encumber to such vse some part of the roome. So go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about it, now we do plainly discerne the vpper couering to he of Badgers skins, to beare off the weather: and the frame it selfe to stand vpright, all of Golde to see too, from beneath the couering towardes the earth, sauing onely that neere to the earth we finde it to be vnder-laid with siluer; and the workmanship of both, though but plaine, yet very orderly and faire. If we looke neerer vnto it, or marke it better, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> then we finde, that neither that Golden frame it selfe, nor that vnder-laying that was of Siluer, is of one intire or whole framing, but that either of them consisteth of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers parcels. For first, that rew of Siluer beneath, we finde to consist of one &amp; forty parcels on either side; and of foureteene at the West end of it; all of one workeman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, and of like distance one from another, substantiall and fayre; and, as it seemeth a good part of them Pike-wise descending into the earth, aswell as we finde a good part of them in sight aboue, and the same of conuenient breadth, strength, and fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to sustaine the frame thereon imposed. On these Bases we finde to bee set, and by certaine Tennons to be let in, as it were, an whole maine wall of Golde, both on the sides and West end of it, and the same about fiue yardes high. But giuing better eye vnto it, we espy all to be of seuerall parcels; but yet to be all in proportion and order: twenty of those parcels at each side, and sixe at the end, all of one mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, forme, and beauty, euery one about tenne cubits high, and about one and an halfe in breadth; euery one likewise by two seuerall Tenons to bee firmely let into those siluer Bases beneath. At the end we find (as we do take it) that both the end and sides are ioyned or coupled together in one, iust at the two Corners of it, by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther two parcels of the like measure, and beauty: but of diuers form from the others. For either of these we take to be all of one peece, &amp; in effect as broad as the others: but to be framed to a right angle: one halfe of their breadth so extended, as may most conueniently meet fit with the sides; and the other in like sort, as may on both sides ioyne fit with the end. Those parcels also wee note to haue two Tennons a peece, in either of their moities one: each of them letting in those Tenons of theirs, into those Sockets or Bases that are next to the corner, on either side of the Corner one; and so letting in one a peece into the sides (which dooth make the odde that we spake of) and another in the end where they are, which also maketh out the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber aforesaide. We found likewise, as we do remember (for others of vs there bee <note place="margin">

<pb n="150" facs="tcp:7530:87"/> couple, in like distance also. By which saide foure rewes of Golden Ringes, there passed foure barres of such wood, as to such purpose was meetest; but euerie of them cleane ouer-layde with beaten Golde: being all to fasten the frame toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Wee heard likewise, that whereas there was a double distance left in the midst, to any other part of it besides, that not onely it was supplied by any other such barre passing through the heart of them all within; but also, that as by the bases they were fastned beneath; so by certaine couplings, which coupled one of them to another, they were likewise fastned at their toppes aboue. So hauing thus farre found the outwarde face or shew of the Tabernacle, for both the sides and farthest end of it, and now drawing towards the entrance of it, there wee first finde, in the Court before it, these two principall things that before wee briefly mentioned: the Altar of Burnt-offerings; and the standing Lauar. The Altar we finde to bee as it were, brest-hie, and of conuenient or competent length and breadth to the vse for <note place="margin">Exod. 27: 1-8</note> the which it was ordained, and to see to, foure square, hollow within but supplyed with a grate, both apt to holde vp the Fewell and fire, &amp; such other things as should be laide thereon, and yet not to stay the ashes, bloode, and the like, but that such thin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

Matters a great deale too farre fetched, and far too base (for diuers of them) to haue at all any place heere: especially, when as there are others of greater dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity a great deale, to whom these are to be reserued: namely, Christ himselfe, and all the company of faithfull, or his true members heere on earth: shewing in what sort they are vnited or ioyned together; and what they are, both in the sight of others, and in themselues, and what notwithstanding by his goodnesse towardes them. For first, as touching the roomth or space that was taken vp, we see it was <note place="margin">The small <gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 word">

Againe, the people were, by estimation, about 200000. persons that belonged vnto it. For those that were at mans state, able to beare Armes, or at the age of twenty yeares, or aboue, were better than 600000. their Women of that age wee <note place="margin">Num. 2: 32, 33</note> may by likelihood account as many or moe, for that it brake no square with them to haue moe Wiues than one; and the younger sort, both Men and Women, som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing capable of instruction in the way of godlinesse, so many moe as are like <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> enough to make vp that number. But heere was not roome for one thousand of them, at once to come in, and worship there, if at any time they were so disposed. The <hi>Priestes</hi> and <hi>Leuites</hi> that were soone after taken in to that seruice, were them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues so many, that the roome was in a manner little enough for so many of them as in their course should there doe their seruice. So it may seeme by this propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that God himselfe also made no other reckoning of that his people, but that, although they were his onely people of all the world, and themselues were a great people too: yet few of them would at any time (to speake of) much regard to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site his Sanctuary, or to tread in that Court of his; not onely, not in the way of any true deuotion indeede, but also but sildome, howsoeuer. The fence of this Sanctuarie, after the manner of the World, was of no strength at all; no more in <note place="margin">The weaknes of the fence.</note> effect, but a peece of Linnen hung round about it: but it had an inuincible strength from aboue. And the sence that his Church, or better sort of his people haue heere, by the great carelesnesse that is in all the great estates of the World gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, is maruellous weake; and, for any good helpe, that at any time lightly they haue thereby, that euer lye open in a manner to the spoyle of all: as euen now also in the daies of the Gospell, and in those that themselues doe most professe it, is plaine to be seene. But vndoubtedly they haue, a strong and sure auenger aboue. Approaching neerer with minde to goe in, wee finde the entry very faire: a good <note place="margin">The entrance into it.</note> allurement vnto all; but yet little regarded by any. And yet notwithstanding, it is very certaine, that euen the very enterance it selfe vnto the Lord, in any good man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, is very faire and beautifull to him: and, in the way of singular blessing. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are any men so farre past all regard of God, but that they also account it a thing of speciall beauty in any, and a speciall ornament vnto them, to be deuoutly giuen: but the wiser, and better sort among them, doe vndoubtedly know it so to bee, and accordingly make that reckoning of it, that to be truely religious towardes GOD, is the only ornament of true honor and beauty that any can haue in all the world; &amp; that without it, whatsoeuer other good or commendable things are in vs, eyther they are of no reckoning at all, as wanting their Grace, or else are fouly blemished be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides.

Comming vnto the Altar of burnt offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, <note place="margin">The brazen Altar.</note> there we finde, as it were, in faire and large Capitall Letters, and very plainely ingrauen thereon, that wee are all, euen the choyce people of God, and the best of those also exceeding sinfull; and that the same sinne of ours is in no wise to be done away but onely by blood: and yet that it is not our owne blood that would serue; but that it must bee the bloud of some other. Necessarily thereunto appertaining, wee finde both a Sacrifice: and a Priest to offer the same. The Sacrifice must be <note place="margin">The <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 word">

In the Priest, who is the chiefe Actor <note place="margin">The Priest.</note> heerein, euen at the first we finde very much: we finde him to bee such as God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe hath appointed, or called vnto it; and such as hee hath accordingly furnished. Our poore harts, euer as we feele the burthen of sinne, and more seriously consider, how fearefull wrath is from the iustice of God due vnto it, would gladly finde, by what good meanes wee might bee reconciled to him againe, to the forgiuenesse of those our sinnes, and to the escaping of those his iudgements: or, who it were, that we might hope, could well vndertake that busines for vs. In which careful thoughts of ours, we can no sooner finde, that God himselfe hath appointed one to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, but that a good part of those fearefull remembrances doe presently vanish a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and our hearts are much releeued thereby. Viewing him better, and more spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially marking how he is furnished, euen at the very first we finde, that his ornaments <note place="margin">The glory of his ornaments.</note> are so many, and so rich, that he is exceeding glorious thereby: and therefore it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be, but that wee may haue very great contentment in him. More specially wee finde, and that but euen in the skirts of his cloathing, that his Pomegranets betoken some fulnesse or speciall abundance, whether of righteousnesse, or of the fauour of <note place="margin">His Pomegra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets and Bels.</note> God towardes those, on whose behalfe he is so called vnto that Priesthood: and that hee cannot addresse himselfe or bend his course to enter the Sanctuary, to make inter cession for his people, but that though himselfe hold his peace, yet euen his Bels yeeld a golden sound in the eares of the Lord. Raising vp our eyes somewhat higher. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> his other ornaments, we finde on his breast a rich and precious Iewel, shewing <note place="margin">His Tablet.</note> the names of all his people to bee as it were ingrauen in his heart, and there likewise to be most pretiously set: and the felfe-same Tablet or Iewell to hang from his shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, from two faire imbossements of Gold, eyther of them set with a faire and large precious Stone, in which the Names of the 12. Tribes were written again, six in the one, and sixe in the other, the better to teach vs, and to make it plainer vnto vs, that he also on his shoulders dooth beare his peoples burthen before the Lorde. And though it be as faire and perfectly wrought, as the skill of man could reach vnto vs (as the Lord himselfe, if we conceiue his meaning aright, did plainly require, when <note place="margin">

For euery of those parcels (whereof the whole frame chiefly consisteth) though they bee but Timber within, yet are they all, and euery of them, ouer-layed with beaten Gold. Certaine it is, we all are Sinners, not onely the meaner, but the better sort also: but beeing o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaide with that beaten Gold, of his holinesse and righteousnesse before God, our sinne is cleane couered, and wee are altogether faire and beautifull to him. And though wee bee seuerall in our selues, yet are wee so coupled one to another, by the meanes that hee hath ordained. The Barres whereby a speciall part of our vniting <note place="margin">The Barres.</note> is performed, are of two sortes; one passing the midst of them all; others, by the out-sides onely. And so it pleaseth him, not onely to vse meanes without, to ioyne vs together: but also to frame our hearts within to incline vnto it. But in this they agree, that these also are all of them cleane couered with that beaten Gold aforesaid: both those hearts that are so inclinable thereunto; and those others that woorke it without. And the whole beeing couered in such sort as it is, so beautifully within, and so prouidently without, we also therein may conceiue, that we are vnder such a <note place="margin">The couerings of it.</note> protection of God, as being to our selues exceeding sweete and glorious, is neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse both sterne and rough enough vnto all the intemperate weather of the world whatsoeuer, that at any time goeth about to impaire the tranquilitie and peace of that his Sanctuary. Comming nowe to the fore-front of it, there to enter, and to <note place="margin">The enterance of it.</note> consider of the thinges within, first we see the front it selfe to be very faire: and sure we are, that not onely any true entrance towardes God is faire in it selfe; but also discloseth many thinges of inestimable price to such, that others doe neuer attaine vnto. Being entered in, there find we all to be full of glory: and sure it is, that the <note place="margin">The glory within gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally.</note> Lordes holy place, euen here on earth, though it consist but of sinfull men, yet hath he adorned the same with so great beauty of spirituall graces, that it is exceeding glorious indeede. More specially we finde therein, a verie good assurance, on the side, that being in him we haue our sustenance, euen all thinges needfull, euer ready, <note place="margin">The Table.</note> both for our bountifull maintenance heere, and to feede vs to life euerlasting: on the other, that he also is a perpetuall light vnto vs, both to direct vs in all our waies here, <note place="margin">The Lights.</note> and especially in those that are to bring vs to his endlesse glory. There also we finde, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> that albeit all thinges we doe vnto God be exceeding short, imperfect, and stayned too too fouly; so that by right, his holinesse and iustice might neuer accept of any thing that we doe vnto him: yet are they so perfumed by Christ, and by that incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable <note place="margin">The Altar of Incense.</note> and exquisite scent, that out of his holinesse and righteousnesse dooth euer arise vnto the Father, that now they are not onely accepted of him, but also become most welcome vnto him. The Inner place, or the <hi>Most-Holy,</hi> we finde to bee <note place="margin">The Vaile.</note> separated from vs, by that faire and rich hanging: but the beauty of it without, doth bid vs expect a far more greater beauty within. For there doe we finde, what spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall <note place="margin">The Arke.</note> great reckoning it pleased God to make of the Ten-Commandements: first, in that he prouided such a Casket to keepe them; then, in gracing them so farre as hee did besides. For the Casket that was prouided to keepe them in, was the Arke, that faire and rich Chest, all ouerlaid with beaten Gold: the lid of it of pure Golde; and gloriously decked with those two Cherubims of Gold likewise. It is true, that some other thinges were afterward put hereunto also, (as afterward we are to see:) but originally, or at the first, that rich, faire, &amp; sumptuous Coffer, was prouided onely for
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:7530:89"/> these. It pleaseth God specially to grace them, two seuerall vvayes besides. One was, that this was vouchsafed to haue the chiefe and principall place in the Tabernacle, or to be accounted the very chiefe and principall thing thereunto ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaining: and therefore in all their iourneyes the honour of precedency or going before, was giuen vnto it. The other, that the Lord himselfe made it, as it were the place of his aboad or being among them, his Cloath of estate, or royal throne; euen betweene the wings of those two Cherubims: and thereupon directed them; when at any time they would aske any question of him, that thither they shoulde repaire for resolution, and there attead to haue his answere; and told them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, that thence he would giue it, euen as out of those two Tables, <hi>The Ten-Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements.</hi> And true it is, that the Ten-Commandements, are another man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner <note place="margin">The ten com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements.</note> of peece of Scripture (as also may appeare by the manner of giuing of them) than they are commonly taken to be, euen by our Leaders themselues, and those oft-times of the greatest too. And seeing the Lorde would thence giue all his answeres, what letteth, but that we also may well assure our selues, that there is no point of dutie or Religion at all, which is not very directly in them, if not in plaine tearmes, and at large, yet (after their manner) implicatiuely and summarily deliuered vnto vs? So there also do we beholde, though not in particular, yet in good measure, and very cleerely, a woonderfull excellency of all holy wisedome and knowledge in those two Tables: either leading or driuing al vnto Christ; and so, to all fulnesse in him. Lastly, we vnderstand likewise, that all this whole buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/>
               <note place="margin">All annointed with sweete Oyle.

            <p n="10">10. Reared vp in this order it was (as God himselfe also commanded) in the <note place="margin">Exod. 40. 1-33</note>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> beginning of the second yeare of their deliuerance out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> euen the verie first day of the same, they beginning (in such respect) their yeare in the Spring, &amp; so, as it were (for there is some oddes) in the beginning of March with vs: the first yeare (all but the first fourteene dayes of the same, which they spent in <hi>Aegypt)</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now spent in comming out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and in comming thus farre into the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernesse; but the most part of it, in prouiding and making these things aforesayd. But now when these things were prouided, and the Tabernacle accordingly erec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, then, shortly after, they were appointed of God to remooue thence, and to go on in their iourney againe. So are we first to consider, of such Stories as belong to the place, where yet they are: then, of such as belong to their remouing hence or going forward. That wee may the better find out what things belonged vnto the place where yet they are, wee are to note, that heere they aboade, vntill the twentith day of the second month, of the second yeare, since they came out of <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt:</hi> and therefore, that such things as we haue in the end of this fortith chapter of <hi>Exodus</hi> for the last fiue verses of it, and all that we haue in the whole Booke of <note place="margin">Exod. 40: 34. Numb. 10: 10</note>
               <hi>Leuiticus,</hi> and in the first nine Chapters, and the first ten verses of the tenth, of the Booke of <hi>Numbers,</hi> doe all appertaine vnto the time of their aboad heere. In which time we haue som-things appertaining vnto the Tabernacle for the erecting &amp; dedicating of it, &amp; some thing of other matters besides. Vnto the Tabernacle for the erecting &amp; dedicating of it, it doth appertaine, first that God did so declare his owne approbation, or his gracious acceptance of it: then, some other things that at <note place="margin">Ex. 40: 34, 35</note> the first erecting of it were to be done by others. God declared his approbation or his gracious acceptance of it, both by a plain visible Testimony to al: and, by some priuate talke that then he had with <hi>Moses</hi> besides. The visible Testimonie was, both in that fire came from him and deuoured the Sacrifice; and in that hee so co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered

That <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> priuate talke that then he had with <hi>Moses</hi> besides, was as touching certaine lawes that then hee did prescribe vnto him: and so most fit to bee remembred togither with others, in another place ensuing. Those other things therefore, that were now there to be done, were diuers: some, appertaining to this present; others, to a time soone after ensuing. Of those that were to be done at this present, we are are first to see, what was to be done by <hi>Moses</hi> himselfe: then, what by others be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides. Of those things that were to be done by <hi>Moses,</hi> some thinges are in plaine tearmes appointed to be done by him: and one thing there is besides, that it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth was for the time to be done by him likewise. Those that in plaine tearmes were appointed vnto him, were the Consecration of <hi>Aaron</hi> and his Sonnes to the Priest-hood; and the cleansing of the Altar: the former of which is distinctly and plainly set downe how it should be done; the other, nothing so plainly as it.

This beeing done, then a sucking Calfe, and two Rammes without blemish, together with a basket of Bread, Cakes, and Wafers, all vnleauened, and of fine Flower (the bread <note place="margin">Ex. 29: 1-3, 10</note> other-wise but such, as, it seemeth, as was ordinary, or such as was vsed to be eaten with meate, but the Cakes tempered with Oyle as the manner is to vse Butter with vs, and the Wafers laide ouer with Oyle too) beeing before to that end prouided, were now presented vnto the Lord. Of which three Beasts, and of that which was in the Basket, part must be offered vnto the Lord: and part must remaine to <hi>Aaron</hi> and his Sonnes, for them to feede on. But if they marked, as then it was euident that they had bodily sustenance by that which did redound vnto them: so had they good and needfull instruction by that which was offered. For first they must haue (notwithstanding that so they were called by the appointment of the Lorde himselfe; had already washed; and were revested now with those holy Garments) a Sin-offering sacrificed for them, which was that sucking Calfe: on which them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues <note place="margin">Ibid. 11-13.</note> all must lay their hands, to acknowledge their owne guiltinesse before him. Then must the innocent beast be killed, as it were for their sinne: his blood being taken must <hi>Moses</hi> put, or some little part of it, euen with his finger on the hornes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> of the Altar, there to remaine as a witnesse against them (though the one was his Brother, and his elder too; &amp; the others, his Nephews) and the rest, as of no worth to such a purpose, but onely in figure, must he powre forth at the foote of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar: the Kidneyes also, and all the fat of the inwards must <hi>Moses</hi> burne on the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar before them. And the better to giue them to vnderstand, how exceeding o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious they were vnto God by their sinne; yea, and how vnworthy also to haue any place at all among men, such as are the people of God: not onely the excrements <note place="margin">Ibid. 14.</note> and skinne, and the other parts of the beast that were the more homely, and to lesse vse, but euen the whole weale besides, though otherwise good and whole-some, and dainty meat, must bee had away, as an execrable thing, and so burnt without the hoast. Then also in the next must the Lord onely be serued: themselues must there haue no part at all yet, hauing already acknowledged their vncleannesse vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord by the other, and novv hauing offered in this apacificatory sacrifice on their behalfe, and the Lord himselfe giuing his Testimony of it, that it should be an acceptable Sacrifice vnto him; heerein may they to their great comfort see, that notwithstanding their vnworthinesse, and extreame insufficiency to bee any Priests vnto him; yet of his goodnesse it pleaseth him to accept of themselues, and
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:7530:90"/> of the administration of that their function. So the next Sacrifice must bee one of <note place="margin">Ibid. 15-18.</note> those two Rammes, which being presented before the Lord, then must <hi>Aaron</hi> and his Sonnes lay on their hands on the head of it also, as beseeching the Lord, in the blood of that guiltlesse Beast (but that being but onely a figure of a more precious blood than it) to accept of them and of their Ministry in those holy thinges about him. Whereupon, the Beast being killed, his blood must be sprinkled round about vpon the Altar: a more euident Token, that they haue no interrest there, nor anie likely-hood of acceptance with him, but onely by bloud. Then must the sacrifice (in some good and decent manner) be cut in pecces; the inwards and legges there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of first washed, and laide in some order together, must bee wholly burnt vnto the Lord: him-selfe assuring them, that it should bee an acceptable Sacrifice vnto him. But now commeth the third wherein <hi>Aaron</hi> and his Sons had a good portion; euen all the flesh almost, and almost all the Bread, Cakes, &amp; Wafers in the basket besides: which was the second of those two Rammes, which now in the third and last place was thus to be sacrificed. First, both <hi>Aaron</hi> and his Sonnes were to lay their hands <note place="margin">Ibid. 19-26.</note> on this also, and so to present him vnto the Lord as to bee a Peace-offering, or a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of Thankes-giuing for them: and so they had very good cause, aswell for tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching them to account them-selues to be very great and detestable sinners, as neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse for giuing so good assurance vnto them, that hee accepted of them to this so <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> great and holy a function. They hauing thus giuen-in that Ramme to bee their Sacrifice, then was <hi>Moses</hi> to kill it, and not onely to sprinckle the blood of this vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Altar, as in the other: but also to put some little part of it on the lappes of the right eares (as to be a speciall earing to them) on the Thumbe of the right handes, (as their Signet of Golde) and on the great Toe of the right feete, both of <hi>Aaron</hi> himselfe, and of his Sonnes with him; and mingling another part of it with some of that Oyle of sweete perfume, to besprinkle both them, and their Garments there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with. A thing of greater price, belike than those faire and rich Garments of theyrs; euen those of <hi>Aarons</hi> also, which were most royall: and those drops, or sprinkling of blood mingled with that Oyle afore-saide, as they were of a fragrant scent, so to be most precious vnto them, and the fairest Iewels in all their Garments.

But heere, whereas most of our Translati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons either adde shaking too and fro withall, in the Text it selfe, or in their Annota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions thereon, and then withall yeelde to <hi>Rab.

God so teaching, that they especially shoulde euer depend on his prouidence, and not to be so doubtfull of it, as to make their al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance they got at one such Sacrifice, to serue them for victuals so long as they could, least no body came a good while after to offer the like. These were the things that should be done for their consecration; but then they were not to bee so <note place="margin">Ex. 29: 35-37</note> done one day onely, but full out seauen dayes together. In which place also there is special mention againe of the Calfe which was their sinne-offering; but of neither of the Rammes, nor of any of the rest: belike, the better to shew, that their sinne was not such as might so easily be purged; least other-wise <hi>Moses</hi> might haue concey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, that that Sacrifice being the first day offered, needed not so often to be with the rest reiterated. For, by nature we easily conceiue, that we are not so very foule, as indeed we are. As touching the cleansing of the Altar (a thing that is not so plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">Ibid. 36, 37.</note> set downe, as the other) the obscurity is, whether there was any speciall cleansing that must be performed, but onely some part of this, or al the whole, that vnder other name is deliuered vnto vs, and that which necessarily thereunto belongeth. If there were any other, I do not yet see what it is; neyther do I see, that it is needfull so to take it: but rather conceiue, that it is to be referred to that which already is spoken of; and, as it seemeth, partly also to that which followeth, the daily Sacrifice. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which, the question is by whom the same was first to bee performed: whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by <hi>Moses;</hi> or by those that now were entering into their Office. If not but by those that now were entering into their office, then ought it not begin til the eight

So it seemeth, that this also was the charge of <hi>Moses</hi> for the time: both because it is now required, before the others were inuested, and the speech thereof so dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to <hi>Moses,</hi> as that it seemeth now to respect him onely therein; and because we haue no farther direction for that matter, till long after the time that they had <note place="margin">Num. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>: 1-10</note> the first vse of it, and often besides, as wee may probably thinke for many yeares, euen all the time almost that they were in the Wildernesse. Allotting it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> to bee performed by him for the time, vntill the others were fully inuested in that new office of theirs, then was he also to offer euery of these daies the daylie Sacrifice: the very chiefe and principall Oblation, as I doe take it, which to this Altar did appertaine, and so is it also taken by others. Concerning which; first, we are to consider of the Sacrifice it selfe: then of the Reasons that there are vsed, <note place="margin">Lyr.</note> to moue them to haue good regard vnto it. In the Sacrifice likewise, we are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, whereof it consisted: and, in what sort it was to be vsed. It consisted part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of a liuing Creature: and partly, of other thinges to goe withall. The liuing Creature was a Lambe, of the first yeare, after that once it was eight daies olde: and the same without blemish; that is, such as had all the Limbs and members per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect; though it were not all of one colour. Those other thinges that were to goe withall, were, a certaine quantity of Flower &amp; Oyle, for an Oblation or meat offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and a certain quantity of Wine for a drink offering. The Flower is accounted to be about a pottle or a quarter of a peck of our measure: the Oyle and Wine, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them but about a quarter so much by some, accounting the same but to a pinte; but esteemed much more by some other. How the same shold be vsed, I find no question at all in others, but that altogether, not onely the Lambe, but the Flower, Oyle, and Wine likewise, should all bee burned vnto the Lord: and that to be made plaine enough by the names that are giuen vnto it, as of <hi>Holocaust</hi> from the Greeke, and of Burnt-offering in English, and one of the wordes that is vsed for it in the Hebrew (for the other importeth the <hi>Ascending</hi> of it) which is as much to say, as consumed by fire; though some there be that conceiue, that the Wine should be poured forth on the Altar, as the Text indeede doth plainely talke <note place="margin">Numb. 28: 7.</note> of pouring it forth, where it is againe repeated. But now, if it may so stand with the Text, that it should be but onely the Lambe that should bee burned, and that <note place="margin">Exod. 29: 42. Num. 28: 6, 8.</note> the name of burnt-offering be giuen to the whoie, but in respect of the chiefe and principall part thereof, which should wholy bee in such sort consumed; and that the <hi>pouring</hi> foorth to the Lord that there is spoken of, may bee meant of pouring forth from the common Vessell wherein it was brought, into some holy Vessell of the Tabernacle to that end ordained: then might we heerein see, whence might a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise some prouision for those that serued at the Altar; especially, if the Oyle and Wine may be conceiued to bee aunswerable in proportion to the Flower, as there <note place="margin">Tremel.

There is no question, but that as God tooke order for them, they had great allowance besides; but yet for the most part but casuall onely: this was not much, and might but hardly serue some very fewe; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> but it was standing, and twice to be had euery day. Againe, being called a <hi>Meate</hi> and <hi>Drinke</hi> offering, the Name we may see would easily bee fauourable to such an <note place="margin">Numb. 28▪ 8.</note> Interpretation, if otherwise it may stand with the Text it selfe. The reasons that there are vsed, doe strongly conclude on that for which they are brought, in that <note place="margin">Exo. 29▪ 42-46</note> they offer so great fauours thence to them all. They shew, likewise how some of our Translatours haue beene deceiued. That kinde of clensing of the Altar that did necessarily appertaine to the performing of these aforesaid Sacrifices, was but such as is incident to all such actions: as first, to make the Altar cleane againe of the Ashes, bloud, and other foulnesse that it got by the Sacrifice before offered, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that they offered any other on it. Those others besides were the Priestes, and Princes. The Priests being now in those seuen daies consecrated to their office, were
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:7530:92"/> on the eight to take their busines in hand: but some of them soone offended there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in to their owne ruine. The businesse that now they had to deale in, was (from this time for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 word">

When first they were to offer for themselues, <hi>Aaron</hi> being the cheefe among them, was himselfe also to be the principall Minister therein: the others, to be attendants and assistantes vnto him. <hi>Aaron</hi> therefore, being first admonished to haue such thinges in a readines, <note place="margin">

For themselues he offered (as he was directed by <hi>Moses,</hi> and he from God) two <note place="margin">Ibid. 7-14.</note> seuerall Sacrifices: a Calfe for a Sin-offering, for the one; and a Ram for a Burnt-offering, for the other. For the people when he was to offer, he did not onely of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer their sacrifices for them: but also told them of another matter that might whet them on to that businesse. For them hee was to offer more than for themselues: but first such as he offered for themselues; then, a Peace-offering besides.

That other matter whereof he told them to whet them on to this businesse, was (as <hi>Moses</hi> also had told him before) that the Lord that day would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare vnto them: whereupon also the assembly drewe neere, and there awaited that fauour of God. Besides these, it was otherwise also incident vnto him to offer the daily Sacrifice, which also is noted that he did: and the proper Sacrifice of the Prince <note place="margin">Ibid. 17. Num. 7: 10, 11</note> that fell for that present. Those that did so soone offend, were <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu,</hi> the two eldest Sonnes of <hi>Aaron:</hi> concerning whom, wee are first to consider of that accident it selfe; then, of somthing else that came in thereupon. In that accident it selfe we are in like manner; first, to inquire, what their offence was; then, to consider of the iudgement, that for the same did fall vpon them. Concerning their offence, it is not altogether vnlikely, but that the occasion of it also may here be noted (as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so it is the iudgment of some that so it is:) &amp; then are we to consider; first of the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of it; then of the offence it selfe. The occasion of it, is by some supposed to be, that <note place="margin">Rab. Simeon. Lyr.</note> they had ouer-shot themselues in drinking; &amp; that opinion resteth on two principall grounds: yet but one of them of any force indeed; &amp; the other of small importance. <note place="margin">Leu. 10: 8-11.</note> That which is of som force indeed, or at least may seem so to be, is, that the Lord see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth thereupon soone after to forbid thē (during the time of their ministration) wine, and strong Drinke: and addeth the reason, to the ende that they may the better dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne all such thinges as belong to their duty. That which is but of small impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, <note place="margin">Arreptis.</note> is, that whereas the vulgar Translation vseth a word that importeth an incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderate, rash, and disorderly catching or snatching vp of their Incense-Cups, when they were therein to offer vp sweete perfume vnto the Lord; and such a kinde of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauiour, doth import the party that in such case should vse it, to be farre out of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per: <note place="margin">Lyr.</note> hence it is gathered, that they were in drinke when they did set in hand with that their businesse; and that the Text it selfe likewise doth import it.

The offence it selfe, is noted to haue two principal heades: one, very certaine; the other also, to <note place="margin">Leu. 10: 1. Num 3: 4. and 26: 61.</note> haue good likelihoodes of it. That which is certaine, is, that they offered with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> strange fire: and so are they most commonly charged. But then wee are heerein to
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:7530:92"/> consider, that without blame, such fire was vsed before: and that, as yet, we reade of no Commaundement giuen, of taking the other. So it may seeme their fault to bee, no manifest breach of that Commaundement; but onely this vnaduisednesse in them, that being now to burne sweet perfume vnto the Lord, notwithstanding that GOD had now sent fire so strangely from his presence: yet they did not thinke it materiall what fire they tooke for this matter; nor that it was any thing needefull, so to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of the Lorde for that. Not much vnlike, as it seemeth to mee, to that defect that was in the Figge-Tree, when Christ beeing hungry, came to bee releeued by it, <note place="margin">Mat. 11: 12, 13</note> but found no helpe at it, because as yet the season did not serue to that purpose. For truely euen Nature it selfe should haue yeelded, without respect of accustomed sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, to the onely Lord of Nature and all: and these two Sonnes of <hi>Aaron,</hi> beeing now so graciously taken so neere vnto him, and to so honourable a seruice of his, should not onely haue taken heede, that they did nothing against any thing that him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe had commaunded: but also, that they did nothing at all vnto him, neither great nor little, in the way of his worshippe, but onely that which they were most assured that himselfe prescribed; and therefore, that if in any thing it was not yet knowne, what was his holy will and pleasure, in any wise they first enquired, before that euer they presumed to doe it. And therefore the sanctifying that there is spoken of, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth <note place="margin">Leuit. 10: 3.</note> not to be so much referred to God; as vnto those that attend his seruice: and so the sense to be, that so many as are vouchsafed to be taken neere vnto him, or that are imployed in his holy seruice, are euer to haue a speciall regard to all their wayes, that in all thinges they ayme at his will and pleasure so neere as they can. That which is not so certaine, but yet hath good likelihoode for it, is, that they had a meaning <note place="margin">Tremel. Inn.</note> with them to enter into the Most-holy place with that their Incense; whereas God had yet set them nothing at all to doe there, and shortly after shewed what was his minde for that matter: namely, that onely the High-Priest should come in thither; and that but once a yeare, and then with diuers speciall Ceremonies also. The like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood <note place="margin">Leu. 16: 1-34.</note> whereupon it standeth, is, that vppon the mention of their death, the Lorde doth afterward aduertise <hi>Moses,</hi> how to instruct his Brother <hi>Aaron,</hi> that hee also run in no danger therein. For seeing that <hi>Aaron</hi> is so specially warned how to enter in there, vpon the death of his two Sonnes before, it may bee conceiued, that they had some such meaning with them; though others there bee that doe not so take it; and <note place="margin">Vatab. Lyr. Bibl. Angl.</note> doe otherwise apply it besides. Their iudgement that did fall vpon them for it, bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as it was a suddaine and a fearefull death, is it selfe a warning sufficient to all, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="L"/> how odious a thing it is vnto God, not much to regard what hee prescribeth, but in <note place="margin">Leuit. 10: 2.</note> his matters to follow our owne mindes also: when as wee see it punished so roundly heere; and on those who but then entring into their office, could not yet be well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with it. But this is not all neyther. For wee are farther giuen to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, that the iudgement of God was so iust therein, and he on all handes so to bee iustified for the same (with what face then will those worshippings of men at that day appeare?) that neither might the Brother in that case mourne for his Brother, no <note place="margin">Ibid. 6, 7.</note> nor the Father for his Sonne. Those thinges that came in thereuppon, were, that both <hi>Aaron</hi> and his Sonnes forgot themselues in other thinges also: insomuch that <hi>Moses</hi> was faine to reprooue them for it, and to set them right againe. And it is <note place="margin">Leu. 10: 12-20</note> no rare thing, that the rashnesse or negligence of some should disturb the seruice of God vnto many: euen to those that are most carefull of all. The Princes perceiuing that the Tabernacle was then to bee erected, and thinking it their partes (at that time especially) to giue some testification of their duties, did then come in with their offeringes also: but as they were heerein of good minde to glorifie God; so it pleased God to honour them. The offering that they were purposed to make, was, first by them all ioyntly together; then, by euery one a part by himselfe. Ioyntly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether <note place="margin">Num. 7: 1-3.</note> their offering was sixe Chariots couered: but of no greater quantity or bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, but that one yoke of Oxen (which the Princes also did giue withall) might bee able to deale with one of those Chariots, and with the burthen thereof thereto ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaining. These did the Lorde himselfe will <hi>Moses,</hi> to take of them to the vse of the Sanctuary: and he, so doing, did shortly after bestow them among the <hi>Leuites,</hi>

The honor that God did them herein, was, that whereas they meant no other, but all to come on one day, it pleased God to giue a seuerall day to euery of them: a good comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table token, that whosoeuer they are that honour God, those also will hee honour; and then lesse maruell, and lesse matter too, albeit he let others slip to some speciall disgrace, who haue little regarded to honor him.</p>
            <p n="11">11 Those other matters besides, were but onely the keeping of a Passe-ouer in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> the due time thereunto ordained, which now approached: and that it pleased God now to acquaint them farther with his minde and pleasure for many thinges else. As touching the Passe-ouer, whereas this solemnity of the dedication of the Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle reached so neere to the time that was appointed to it, that the people were in danger to haue forgotten it, if they had not beene remembred of it, it pleased God <note place="margin">Numb. 9: 1-5</note> before-hand to put them in minde of it: and so it was orderly kept in the time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed. But then there fell out another matter thereupon: namely, that some be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">Ibid. 6, 7.</note> at that time Legaly vncleane, and in such sort that then they might not hold that Feast as their bretheren did, they opened their case vnto <hi>Moses,</hi> and desired some remedy for it. Whereuppon <hi>Moses</hi> enquiring of the Lorde, had this direction for <note place="margin">Ibid. 8-12.</note> them and others, that if any of them at any time after should be so polluted by a dead body (for in such case a Sacrifice were first to be offered, as it seemeth, which would <note place="margin">Leui. 5: 2. 21: 1 Num. 5: 1-3.</note> aske some longer time for those that were in such sort polluted, but immediatly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Pascall was to be offered) or should be farre off in a iourney, so that at that time he could not keepe it, he should doe it the same day the next month following, but otherwise obseruing the order prescribed: and that whosoeuer should otherwise <note place="margin">Numb. 9: 13.</note> of negligence slip it, or not regard to obserue that Feast, he should bee cut off from the people. A good warning to many of ours: not onely to such as doe so little regard at all to communicate; but also to such, as at sometime being vnmeete, doe not get themselues meete within such time as heere is appointed. Those other thinges wherein it pleased him nowe to acquaint them farther with his minde and pleasure, were many and diuers; but such as in my minde doe most of all tend (a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry few onely excepted appertaining vnto the Priestes, and therefore reserued to their proper duty) to one of these two: eyther to set some good order for the whole body of them: or else to frame them all in particular vnto such a course, as wherein they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> might bee most acceptable to God. To set some good order for the whole bodie of them, we see that care to be taken for them, both Ecclesiastically and Ciuilly also. Ecclesiastically, first in that order that was taken about the <hi>Leuites:</hi> first, in exempting them, from the rest of their bretheren, to the seruice of the Sanctuary; then, in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stributing their seruice vnto them. Concerning the exempting of them, from the rest of their bretheren to the seruice of the Sanctuary, God doth both tell them by <note place="margin">Num. 3: 5-10, 11-13. 8: 17.

Shekles in all, which (accounting the Shekle of the Sanctuary with them, to be about fiue shillinges with vs) came to about 340. pounds, and somewhat better: and that both the <hi>Leuites</hi> themselues, and the Money that the ouer-plus came vnto, should be giuen to <hi>Aaron</hi> and his Sonnes. The <hi>Leuites</hi> beeing thus <note place="margin">Ibid. 3: 5▪ 10. 48. 8: 16-19.</note> exempted, then was there farther order taken, both at what age they should begin there to serue: and, what was the seruice that then they should doe. The age when they should beginne, was fiue and twenty yeares: and so now (at the first) was <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> willed to take so many of them as were of that age, and to purifie them to theyr businesse. The manner whereof was such, as that thereby they were giuen to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand, <note place="margin">Ibid. 8: 5-26.</note> that of themselues they were vncleane to such a purpose, as also themselues must actually acknowledge: and the whole Congregation must make an actuall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuery of them vnto that seruice. But then they had no charge to beare the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then of the Tabernacle till they were of the age of thirty yeares: and then againe, when they came to fiftie, they were deliuered from all laborious woorke thereunto appertaining. For which cause it was farther appointed, that the summe of so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <note place="margin">Ibid 4: 1-49.</note> of them, as were of the age of thirty yeares, and not exceeding fifty, should bee taken seuerally of the three Families of the <hi>Leuites:</hi> the <hi>Koathites, Gersonites,</hi> and the <hi>Merarites;</hi> and their seuerall seruices and places set downe vnto them.

But it is plaine, that the two others were appointed to <hi>Ithamar</hi> the youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger: and so hee thereby made somewhat equall vnto his brother. Then was there <note place="margin">Num. 10: 1-10</note> another thing that tooke part with both, the ordinance of those two Siluer Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets: but yet because they were in the only custody of the Priestes, and were to bee vsed onely by them, therefore may they be so much the rather taken into these also. The vse therefore of these, was, so farre as appertaineth to the matter that now wee are in, to bee founded by the Priestes in certaine of their solemne Feastes: and at some of their Sacrifices also.

Those that seem <note place="margin">Numb. 10: 10</note> to be implied besides, are not named vnto vs: but it may seeme, that some such there were, both because they were directed to blow them in the time of publike gladnes, and in some other Feastes besides immediatly after, but yet not named. Those Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices of theirs wherein likewise they were directed sometime to sound them, were

That these may orderly take their places, they are first directed how to do it in their pitching or Camping about the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> where they are yet: and after that, how they are to march forwarde in their iournyings, whensoeuer they are to remooue. In their pitching about the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle where they were yet, leauing conuenient space betwixt them and the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle for the <hi>Leuites, Iudah</hi> and his company were to be on the East; <hi>Ruben,</hi> on <note place="margin">Numb 2▪ 3. 10, 18, 25.</note> the South; <hi>Ephraim,</hi> on the West; and <hi>Dan</hi> on the North. When they were to remoue, we are to consider, not onely of these foure maine battailes them-selues, but of others besides: some that were Leaders vnto them; others that were ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led among them. Leaders vnto them were, the Cloude and the Arke: mingled among them were the <hi>Leuites.</hi> The Cloud that we speake of, was first giuen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <note place="margin">Exo. 13: 21, 22</note> them in the land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> as they were to depart out of the same: and, as it was in the day time a Cloud, so was it in the night time a piller of fire. When they were to remoue, this Cloud would then aduance it selfe and be going forward, that <note place="margin">Nu. 9: 15-23.</note> way that they were to go. Thereupon must all prepare to remoue. The Priests <note place="margin">Ibid. 4. 45-14. 17-20. Ibid. 15. 20. Ibid 24-28.</note> must come and fold or lap vp the holyest thinges of the Tabernacle: and the <hi>Koa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thites</hi> must be ready then to take them to carry. The <hi>Gersonites</hi> must take downe the Vailes, Couerings, and Hangings, lap them vp, and make them meete for car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage: and the <hi>Merarites</hi> plucke out the Barres, take vp those plankes and all their Sockets or Bases, then also the pillers together with the Sockets, Pins, and Cords, <note place="margin">Ibid. 31-33.</note> thereunto appertaining, and make them all ready to carry. The lapping vp of the Holyest things of the Tabernacle was, to see too, after one manner; vnlesse the lapping vp of the Atke did in one thing varry from the others: but it rather see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:7530:94"/> that it did not, sauing that inwardly it had one lapping more.

Whereas therefore the <hi>Koathites</hi> are allowed to beare all the most holy things generally (of which number this that we speake of was certainly one) <note place="margin">Numb. 4: 15.</note> it is most likely, that these did it, if not altogether (because those that were Priests indeede, <hi>Elezar</hi> and <hi>Ithamar</hi> are plainly appointed to be Ouer-seers to all the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uites,</hi> and to some other such businesse besides as could not stand with this, as by and by we are to heare) yet for the most part without all question. And whereas <note place="margin">Ios. 6: 4, 6, 8, 12</note> a while afterward, we haue mention in <hi>Iosuah</hi> of so many Priests, that out of them might be chosen enow to beare the Arke, and seauen moe to blow those Trumpets to the walles of <hi>Iericho,</hi> and yet we haue no such mention (nor likelyhood neither) of any such number of Priests to haue in so short a time descended of the Sonnes of <hi>Aaron,</hi> or otherwise to be taken to that function: it is most likely that the chiefe of the <hi>Leuites,</hi> especially of the <hi>Koathites</hi> that dealt with the things that were most ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, are meant to be the Priests that are spoken of there. These beeing gone on, <note place="margin">Num. 10: 8.

               <note place="margin">Ibid. 6.</note> the Priests, againe to sound their Trumpets to giue like warning to the second host to addresse themselues to follow, and then to set forth, which second maine hoast was that of <hi>Reuben</hi> and his associates; and so were they to do for the rest.

But <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> another is heere of greater difficulty: Namely, in what sort the Tabernacle and <hi>Leuites</hi> were sorted among them.

In another place it is likevvise set downe in the Text it selfe, that when first of all they remoued, and vvere then to put in vre <note place="margin">Num. 10: 17.</note> this that was newly prescribed vnto them, two of the three families of the <hi>Leuites,</hi> which were the <hi>Gersonites</hi> and the <hi>Merarites,</hi> went forward with the Tabernacle and the things thereunto appertaining (so farre as their charge reached) immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately after the first maine army: and that the <hi>Koathites,</hi> the third family of the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uites,</hi> who bare the rest of the most holy things (the Arke being gone alreadie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) <note place="margin">Ibid. 21.</note> followed after <hi>Ruben</hi> and his company, who made the second of those maine battailes afore-saide, and so left those other two maine armies remaining (which were of <hi>Ephraim</hi> and <hi>Dan)</hi> both behinde them.

But that this order was their meaning, it seemeth to me, that their owne words can giue no other. For <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> first conceiuing that the latter part of the verse dooth direct those Armies to come and place themselues at the side of the Sauctuary (as neither the vulgar Translation, <note place="margin">Num. 2: 17.</note> nor our English, nor <hi>Fran. Vatablus,</hi> nor <hi>Arias Montanus</hi> doo) then they adde in their Margent, <hi>Quasi dicat, Sunto castra quadrata: quorum medium obtineat Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernaculum; sic vt nemo ante eat Leuitis, sed omnes ad latus corum procedant, faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant{que} castra:</hi> that is, As though the Lord should say vnto them, Let your Campe bee a foure-square: in the midst whereof you shall so leaue to the Tabernacle, that none doe goe before the <hi>Leuites;</hi> but that all goe forward a-side by them, and a-side by them Camp likewise. Allowing none therefore to goe <hi>before</hi> them, but setting all to march a-side by them, it is plaine enough in it selfe, that that is the order that they conceiue to bee required hereby. But first of all the Tabernacle, and the <hi>Leuites</hi> could not so precisely bee in the midst neyther. For as I noted before, all those fiue portions or battailes could not be of like bignesse; but were in plaine sight, diuers of them much bigger than others. Insomuch, that the right side of them would cast the Tabernacle and the <hi>Leuites</hi> so farre from the midst towardes the left hand of them (conceiuing our selues to be as yet in the place whence they remooued; and to cast our eye after them, to see what order they keepe in their iournying) so farre as the moyty of threescore and twelue thousand, one hundred and fifty men (by which number, the right side in that course would exceede the left) could bee able to cast them; which moity onely wee may conceiue, to bee about twice so much as themselues: and then would the whole cast them far a-side, and make the forme so farre out of fashion, as I thinke wee finde not in any course that God hath ordained to set thinges in order. Then also, if we looke to that the people did, though I do not account them, well to haue followed the direction that God did giue them: yet neither doe I thinke them so wide, as this would set them. For in their first practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of the direction that God had giuen them, most of the <hi>Leuites,</hi> euen two parts, of three, did plainely put themselues in their iournying betwixt <hi>Iudah</hi> and <hi>Ruben,</hi> the <note place="margin">Num. 10: 17.</note> two first Armies of the foure: and thereby doe plainely shewe vs, that it was not so vnderstood then, by themselues or others, that they should haue beene in the middest of all. And when we looke what they say to that place, to see how they reconcile the one to the other, there doe wee finde nothing at all that they alleage in strengthening this their opinion heere: but contrariwise euen by their owne Translation wee finde the time to be so specially noted, by <hi>Tunc</hi> in the verse before <note place="margin">Ibid. 18.</note> alleaged, and by <hi>Postea</hi> in the next that followeth, that themselues do thereby grant, that it is out of doubt, that those two parts of the <hi>Leuites</hi> in that iournying of theirs, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> tooke their place betwixt those two for-most battailes of all. Which if they must graunt that they did indeede, then, is it great likelihood, that by their so taking it so generally, that though it may be they did not fully hit the course that was appointed vnto them: yet therein were they neerer vnto it, than this course of theirs would haue set them. That it may the better appeare, if an hundred men, make ten square; and so, an hundred thousand in all, tenne thousand square: then, sixe hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand, must likewise make threescore thousand square. To whom, if we allow rata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to euery man one pace, such as whereof a thousand make a mile: so may wee see, that they must bee allowed threescore miles breadth to march in; or else that they may not be such a square, as they doe seeme there to conceiue. And in that breadth what helpe might bee conceiued for their direction, either of the Arke that going a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a mile before, or almost of the Cloude eyther, vnlesse it should aduance it selfe much higher (yea, and aboue the heigth of other Cloudes also) than it seemeth it was wont to doe? As also if they should lengthen their Files, double, treble, or four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folde, so to take in or shorten their front: yet so also would it fall out to be ouer great
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:7530:96"/> a breadth, still to be serued with conuenient passage; and yet besides haue a daunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and cumbersome length to traile so long after them, as so they should be forced to doe. But to shut vp this matter, the truth is, that though that conceite doe goe vnder the name of them both, yet it is but the latter of them that may truely be char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with it: as may plainely appeare by those Bibles that was published by them both together, while the former also liued; and namely in that which was printed with vs. For in those neither haue we in that former place that Translatiō that I noted, to varry from all others in the Text it selfe: nor that note in the Margent that I shewed to bee <note place="margin">Anno. 1585.</note> set vpon it. But contrariwise, in that other place which followeth, both wee haue <note place="margin">Num. 10: 17.</note> the Translation it selfe strong against that opinion, by so precise setting downe the time, when those two Families of the <hi>Leuites</hi> did first set forward: and in the fourth verse after, the Text speaking of those two Families of the <hi>Leuiets</hi> again, thēselues do <note place="margin">Ibid. 21.</note> plainly set downe in the Margent, that they had taken their place before immediatly after the first company. So it appeareth, that while they were both together, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of both those places kept out that conceit that afterward followed: but when the one of them was departed, then, the other ventured vppon it; but withall forgot, to take some farther order for this which was like to bewray it. So to veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the Prouerbe vnto vs, that moe eyes see more, than any one commonly dooth. But if neither of these seeme to be the sense or meaning of that going in the midst that there is spoken of, then are we farther to consider, what other sence may seeme most likely to stand there-with. Wherein I for my part could goe no farther, but <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="L"/> onely so to take it, as though it had beene the meaning of God, that the Tabernacle and the <hi>Leuites,</hi> should all goe betwixt the second and the third of those foure bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailes: especially, because it is saide, after the first two are gone before, <hi>Then the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle of the Congregation shall goe, &amp;c,</hi> so noting the time when they were to set <note place="margin">Num. 2: 17.</note> forward, that it might seeme impiety for any, so much as to goe about to looke for any other.

Which also is indifferently well confirmed by their practise at the first before touched. For if they had taken it, that they should not haue taken their place, but onely after the second battle was gone forward, it is not likely, that so many of them would haue taken place before: and if they had vnderstood it, that whereas there would be three spaces betwixt those foure Armies, they should precisely keepe to the middlemost of them, it is as vnlikely againe, that so many of them would so readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly haue taken the first. The <hi>Leuites</hi> therefore hauing this liberty left them, nowe are wee to see, how they might best vse it to the furtherance of their businesse they had in hand. Where first we see, it was best for them, in all their iournyings, euer to be within the strength of their Bretheren: as also they were very plainely thereunto directed by God himselfe. Then, when they should pitch, and reare vp the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle, they were to bee in such readinesse for it, as best might serue to the good and ready dispatch thereof. This (it appeareth) they plainely endeuoured, when those two Families got before, to get the place in a readinesse, against the principall things <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="M"/>
               <pb n="169" facs="tcp:7530:96"/> should come, which yet were behinde with the third Family of them. But herein they missed of the readiest way, that they went both of them together, when as the one of them could doe nothing (to speake of) till the other had done. For the <hi>Merarites</hi> must first doe their businesse, before the <hi>Gersonites</hi> could meddle with theirs: and those that could not yet bee occupyed, were likely enough one way or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to be a cumber to some of their Bretheren that eyther were occupyed, or but comming vp to take their place appointed, and so be no better than a confused com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany by it. Whereas, on the other side, there were three seuerall spaces betwixt those foure Armies, if but the <hi>Merarites</hi> had taken the first, the <hi>Gersonites</hi> the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, &amp; the <hi>Koathites</hi> the third, then had they not onely placed themselues amongst their Bretheren, according to the direction of God, yea, euen in the midst of them, if any delight rather, so to read: but also they had so beene in best readinesse, order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to performe what they had to doe. And so wee may hope that after they did: though, as the manner is, at the first they something missed. As also this course doth better agree to the latter part of Gods direction, than did their former. For <note place="margin">Num. 2: 17.</note> he doth there plainely tell them, that as they pitched or encamped before, so should they afterward also march or goe forward: but they pitched in three seuerall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies; and so haue they amongst their Bretheren (belike to that end) three seuerall places for them. So omitting the opinions of others who haue not so much regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Text it selfe, thus we conceiue for this matter, that after the first of those Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies led by <hi>Iudah,</hi> the <hi>Merarites</hi> followed with such thinges as to them belonged: after <hi>Ruben,</hi> the <hi>Gersonites;</hi> after <hi>Ephraim,</hi> the <hi>Koathites; Dan</hi> immediatly after shutting vp all, and therefore called the <hi>Gathering Hoast,</hi> as hauing charge to leaue <note place="margin">Num. 10: 25.</note> none behinde, but euer to see that they take all with them. So likewise when they were to pitch and Campe againe, that the Cloude first staying there, those that bare the Arke, made a stand likewise. Then, that all the rest came vp in their order, those of <hi>Iudah</hi> taking the East, a good distance from the Arke, whom the <hi>Merarites</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, <note place="margin">Num. 2: 3.</note> went towardes the Arke, and there set vp (orderly coasted) all the Pillers of the Court first, then the Boardes or Plankes of the Tabernacle, together with the Pillers thereto belonging; and then went themselues, some reasonable distance off, to the North. That those that were of the Hoast of <hi>Ruben,</hi> comming vp next, took their place in much like distance towards the South: and that the <hi>Gersonites</hi> follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">Num. 2: 10.</note> after, and approaching towards the Arke, couered the Tabernacle, and hung vp the Vaile for the enterance of it, and then hung vp the Court likewise, together with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="N"/> the vaile at the enterance of it, and then went themselues some conuenient distance of, towardes the West. Then, that those that were of the Hoast of <hi>Ephraim</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming <note place="margin">Num. 2: 18.</note> vp next, and placing themselues, about such like distance from the Tabernacle, (beyond the <hi>Gersonites)</hi> on the West, the <hi>Koathites</hi> following; first did the businesse to them appertaining: and then tooke their place as was appointed. Their businesse was now not like to al: for, some of the <hi>Koathites,</hi> we must conceiue, were yet with the Arke, as those that had the carriage of it: others, now to bring in the residue of those things that belonged vnto their charge. But when they had brought them, they might not vnfolde them or take them out; but now the Priests the Sonnes of <hi>Aaron</hi> must come, and either dismisse them vpon their comming, and do the rest themselues; or at least themselues vnfold all, and hang vp the vaile before the Arke, and send the others away with their Couerings. Which when they had doone, and such other things as belonged vnto them, then were they to part two seuerall wayes: <hi>Moses</hi> &amp; <hi>Aaron</hi> with their families (being themselues of the <hi>Koathites</hi> also) towards the East, a conuenient distance from the enteraunce into the Tabernacle; and the rest of the of the <hi>Koathites</hi> towards the South, betwixt the <hi>Tabernacle,</hi> and those of the hoast of <hi>Ruben</hi> beyond them. Next after whom came vp <hi>Dan,</hi> the last battell of them al, and the greatest but one; who had also the charge to leaue none behinde if any fain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <note place="margin">Num 2. 25.</note> by the way, but to bring all such with them: and tooke his place on the North, in like distance from the Tabernacle as others before. Which distance of theirs from the Sanctuary, before mentioned in the Camping of euery of them▪ though the Text doth not declare: yet may any conceiue some such conuenient distance as was most
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:7530:97"/> seemely to bee obserued, and most meete for the people themselues; as not vrging them, either to thrust themselues ouer close together, or to pitch, ouer farre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sunder.

But these things do, in their particulars so much appertaine to matter of Doctrine, that hauing another place fitter for them, we are heere, for this time to let them alone, and to reserue them to that other place more proper for them. Now therefore as touching their remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing hence, and going forward in their iourney againe, till they so offended, that they were turned backe into the Wildernesse, there, with a long and irksome Pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, to reape the fruites of that their disobedience and vnbeleefe, wee are first to consider of this their iournying: then, of such thinges as fell out therein. In this their ioyurnying likewise we haue occasion giuen vs, first to consider, who they were that now tooke their iourney we speake of: th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

Those of whom we haue no mention at all heere, were a great mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of sundry sortes of people, who as it seemeth, nowe also went with them, though heere wee haue no mention of them. For it is certaine, that such ioyned themselues to this people when first they came out of <hi>Aegypt;</hi> and shortly after <note place="margin">Exod. 12: 38.</note> dooth the Story make mention of such againe to bee among them: and wee haue no mention at all of any departing away againe of those that came first; <note place="margin">N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

But, seeing when first he came, it is certain that then he returned againe, by the Text; and that heere hee made no promise of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming backe to them againe, but that themselues by adding a word, did thinke good <note place="margin">Exod. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

That afterward we finde some of that Kindred to be among them, it importeth no more, but that sometime or other they came vnto them: and it may bee, after these had past their pilgrimage, as likely as now. <hi>Moses</hi> Father in Law must by all likely-hood now bee well strucken in yeares, <hi>Moses</hi> him-selfe that married his Daughter being now some-what better than foure-score yeares old: &amp; then as <hi>Barzillay</hi> (at those yeares saide to be a very aged man) did afterward excuse <note place="margin">Sam. 19: 32-37.</note> himselfe to <hi>Dauid,</hi> but yet sent <hi>Chimham</hi> his Sonne with him; so in this also is it not vnlikely, but that the olde man himselfe woulde resolutely free himselfe from such iournying now, and rather encline to finish his dayes among his owne people at <note place="margin">Cal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Tnis inclination of all the elder sort generally, seemeth to me to be the most learned Interpreter of all, for all such places. So it it certaine, that the <hi>Israelites</hi> were of this company; and in a maner certaine too, that those other Straungers (or many of them) that came out of <hi>Egypt</hi> with them, were with them now also: but for <hi>Hobab</hi> and his company, such at the least as he thought good to take with him back again, I see no great likelyhood to find them heere now in this their iourney. As touching the iourney it selfe, that nowe they went three dayes iourney, and the people in that order that before is described, there is no question: the Text it selfe is plaine for them both. But whether at the first they trauelled all that whole time <note place="margin">Num. 10: 33. 14-28.</note> without intermission, or taking any rest betwixt; or trauelled but in the day time <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> onely, and in that sort three dayes together: it is not in the Text so plainly decided; and probabilities it seemeth, there be for both. For seeing the people murmured immediately after, it may seeme therby that their iournying now was great: though that also might be vpon their trauelling three dayes together, though they had the nights to rest in, hauing layde in one place before so long as they did. On the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">Num. 10: 33, 36.</note> side, because the Prayer which a little after <hi>Moses</hi> is sayde to haue made, when the Arke went forward, and when it rested, is so set downe, as if at such times <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> was wont to vse it, and not for once onely: he could not so haue vsed it yet at se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall times, if this had beene but one entire iourney, all those three dayes and three nights, without intermission. Their Cattle also, especially such as were young, or were with young, and their young children, and the more aged and weaker sort among them may seeme not to be able any way to performe it, but with some inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission or rest betwixt. So likewise, in what sort the Arke went in this iourney, is not conceiued alike withall. For whereas the <hi>Hebrew</hi> word, (<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 span">

               </gap>) as <hi>Arias Montanus</hi> doth Interpret it, doth signifie <hi>Before them,</hi> (as also the vulgar translation did interpret it before, our <hi>English Bibles, Vatablus</hi> and <hi>Caluine</hi> since; and, that most is to be marked, both <hi>Tremellius</hi> and <hi>Iunius</hi> too:) now, since at that time, <hi>Iunius</hi>
               <note place="margin">Anno.

Dom. 1593.</note> referreth vs to that place for our warrant therein. So hee is of minde now, that the Arke did not go before them, but in the midst of them and in their sight: and
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:7530:98"/> that so good company of it among them, did make the people go that three daies iourney all at once without intermission. But it seemeth to mee, that the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall iudgement of others besides how to take the Originall therein, the practise of it by <hi>Iosuah</hi> and the Priests after, and his owne taking it so before, while hee was <note place="margin">Ios. 3: 3, 4, 6, 11, 14, 17.</note> by that more likely direction hedged. in vnto it, might well haue beene sufficient to haue stayed him where he was before: or at least to satisfie vs, rather to rest with him in his former iudgement, than to varry with him in the latter. The thinges that did fall out therein, are nothing else in a manner, but onely a naughty mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring against God and <hi>Moses</hi> for this his gouernment, and for their estate there: for the which first he chasteneth but certaine of them; but then afterward he doth punnish them all together. When he chasteneth but certaine of them, hee was <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> notwithstanding prouoked vnto it first by the whole people generally: then, by certaine of the chiefest of them. By them all generally, twice: first, as it seemeth, for being now led so painefull a iourney; then, about their victuals againe. When <note place="margin">N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>m. 11: 1-3</note> they murmured, as it seemeth, for this their iourney, the Lord kindled a Fyre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, and consumed of the vtter-most of them: but when they cryed vnto <hi>Moses,</hi> and he to the Lord, the fire was quenched; but such a name was left to the place, as might afterward be a warning vnto them. In that wherein they murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red about their victualles, there fell out another matter thereon, of speciall mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: so are we first to consider of that in it selfe; then, of that other that fell out vpon it. In that their murmuring it selfe, we are likewise to note, first their fault: then their punnishment. In their fault likewise, first the occasion of it: then what it was that by that occasion they fell into. The occasion of it was, those strangers that came foorth with them out of <hi>Egypt;</hi> who hauing kept themselues now a long <note place="margin">N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>m. 11: 4.</note> time reasonable well (for ought we heare of them) beginning to murmure about their victuals, make the rest of their people to murmure also. As among vs, such as haue beene before brought vp in ignorance and error, though for a time some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they hold: yet easily and soone they fall out againe. That which the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple by this occasion fell into, was that the rest of the people murmured also, yea <note place="margin">Ibid. 4-9.</note> and wept besides in the griefe of their harts that they were so dealt with: as indeed it was an irkesome thing to flesh and blood, all the whole yeare to be kept to one kinde of sustenance without any change; enough to make the most daintiest food that could be conceiued, at length to be loathed. Their punnishment was, euen in the thing that they desired: God giuing flesh vnto them to their owne desire in great aboundance; but then sending his plague withall. So we also, if wee hold <note place="margin">Ibid. 18-23. 31-34.</note> not our selues content with some lower and meaner estate that God hath giuen vs, may indeede oftentimes obtaine some better: but then let vs also take heede, that some fearefull hand of God do not follow vpon it immediately after. That other thing that came in heereupon, was, a farther augmentation vnto the gouernment that already they had among them: in which also we are first to consider of the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of it; then, what it was that was done thereby. The occasion was, that now also <hi>Moses</hi> became impatient, and in his impatiency did expostulate with God, and <note place="margin">Ibid. 10-15.</note> finde himselfe much grieued, that God shoulde still so trouble him with the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment of that vnruly people. In that which was done thereby, wee are not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> to consider, what it was: but also to note the maner of it. It was a supply of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny moe wise and discreet men, such also as otherwise were of speciall reckoning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong <note place="margin">Ibid. 16, 17, 24, 30.</note> the people for their prehaeminence and dignity among them, to assist <hi>Moses</hi> in the gouernment of the people, to the number of three-score and ten in all: a forme of gouernement, that, as it seemeth (and for much of the time is apparant enough) did hence-forward stand and continue with them (especially when they had no Kings of their owne) so long as the people themselues did stand. The ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of it was, that God did take off the same Spirit or measure of grace, where-with <note place="margin">Ibid. 25, 26.</note> he had to that end before endued <hi>Moses,</hi> and diuided to euery of them apart there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, so to enable them vnto that businesse together with him. Which as it was a snub vnto <hi>Moses,</hi> for charging God to ouer-charge him aboue the ability that hee had giuen him: so is it a lesson to vs, not to repine at any burthen that God layeth
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:7530:98"/> on vs, but assuredly to know, that euer he giueth ability correspondent; they all ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing no more now (and yet the same working mightily in them) than onely <hi>Moses</hi> had before, though himselfe now had not that consideration, that so wee may euer now and then finde, that <hi>Aliquando bonus dormitat Homerus.</hi> The offence that was made by certaine of the chiefest of them, was that same which shortly after wee finde was committed by <hi>Mirian</hi> or <hi>Mary,</hi> the Sister of <hi>Moses,</hi> and a Prophetesse <note place="margin">Exod. 15: 20.</note> her selfe: and by <hi>Aaron</hi> the High-Priest his Brother. What their fault was, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth not to bee in the Text it selfe fully declared.

                  <hi>Antiq. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 5.</note> be called an <hi>Aethyopian,</hi> are some of them good. But when <hi>Iosephus</hi> doth plainly say, that while he was a great man in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> hee married an <hi>Aethyopian</hi> Ladie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede: I do not see, but that this might rather bee meant of her; and finde withall, <note place="margin">Lyra. ibid.</note> that others haue beene of the same minde also. And this seemeth to stand, not so much on the report of <hi>Iosephus,</hi> as vpon the Text it selfe. For after that <hi>Moses</hi> hath tolde vs, that they murmured or spake against him, because of a woman of <hi>Aethyo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pia</hi> that he had maried: he addeth again, for he had married a woman of <hi>Aethyopia.</hi> which forme or manner of speaking he doth not seeme so much to speake of <hi>Zippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah</hi> whom he had there, a woman (no doubt) sufficiently knowne to them all (espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
               <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> if she were so rare a woman as there be of the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> that report she was) as of some other of whom they all had not so perfect knowledge, and therefore him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe doth now acknowledge it also: namely, that such an one sometimes hee had. <hi>Tremellius</hi> and <hi>Iunius</hi> do indeede something incline their Translation vnto the sence that they conceiue, in that second member of it; and the vulgar translation dooth leaue it cleane out: but the Originall hath it; and so doth our English, <hi>Arias Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanus, Ʋatablus,</hi> and <hi>Caluin</hi> plainly distinguish. Now what it is, that, as touching her, they charge him withall, neither is it set downe, neither then do we need to vse any ghesses of our owne: but for any thing that I do finde, if in <hi>Aethyopia</hi> hee did so marry, it were harde I thinke for any to say, that euer hee did come at her againe, though well we may hope, it was some reasonable course that therein he helde, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding it be vnknowne vnto vs. Concerning the latter, that do we finde to shew it selfe more plainly vnto vs: namely, that it was aemulation in them, not taking it well, that he should, as it were ingrosse all the doings vnto himselfe. As in this <note place="margin">Num. 12: 2.</note> age of ours we also haue seene combining together, of some not so vehement, but of other importunate spirits mingled withall: who notwithstanding haue both sorts of them ioyned together, against such as God himselfe hath placed, euen for the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the Church among vs. But as such repining at his greater place of those that were so neere vnto him, might well put him-selfe in minde how vnaduisedly he char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged God to lay ouer heauy a burthen on him: so might the people as plainly see, that it was no packe among themselues, that those two Brethren had the two chiefe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces betwixt them; the one, the Gouernment, the other the Priest-hood. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause in this <hi>Mary</hi> onely was punished, as also in this action she is first named; and <note place="margin">Ibid. 5-15.</note>
               <hi>Aaron</hi> is but onely reprooued, and besides was bolde to make intercession for <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> when he saw that shee was strucken: therefore it seemeth we may safely gather, that for this matter the greatest fault was onely in her. When he doth punish them altogether, therein also we are to consider, first of their fault: then of their punnish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Their fault had two principall heads: one, that they would send in some of their owne to search the Land; the other, that then they plainly refused to enter at all, and would needs turne backe to <hi>Aegypt</hi> againe. In that they woulde send in some of their owne to search the Land their fault likewise (no doubt) was double: <note place="margin">Deut. 1▪ 22. Numb. 13: 2.</note> first, in that themselues did first desire it; then, in that they refused the Lande when God was content to yeelde it vnto them. For in that they did first desire to haue that search, it was a plaine token of their Infidelity, and a manifest fruite of the same,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:7530:99"/> God hauing already tolde them, both that the Land it selfe was good; and that he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> would giue it vnto them. Now therefore dooing thus, they put God on his tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, to be tryed by a Iury of theirs, whether he sayde truely or not: much like to a sort of false-hearted Christians among vs also, who haue likewise as slender respect to the word of God, vnlesse they haue some of their owne to approue it. Neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse, seeing so they would haue it, he yeeldeth vnto it, and himselfe dooth set <hi>Moses</hi> about it: and <hi>Moses,</hi> acknowledging that he also liked the motion well, <note place="margin">Num. 13: 2, 3 Deut. 1: 23.</note> accordingly setteth in hand with it too. But they might haue done a great deale better, therein to haue giuen such another example, as <hi>Dauid</hi> afterward did about the waters of the Well of <hi>Bethlehem:</hi> which though in his thirst hee earnestly desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, <note place="margin">2. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

So, though these had made that motion before, and resolutely were bent with themselues so to haue it, yet when they had time to bethinke themselues better, and consider what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignity thereby they should offer to the Truth of God (of which they had already had so great experience, and of his great goodnesse withall vnto them) to put it to the triall of lying men, and to be of no farther account with them, than they shold approue it: what could haue beene more agreeable to their duty, then, how could they haue giuen a better example to those that followed, wherein could they more haue glorifyed God, and what could haue beene more honorable vnto themselues, than vtterly to haue relinquished that request of theirs nowe, themselues to haue stamped it vnder their feet, and altogether with one voice, with blubbred eies, &amp; bleeding hearts, to haue desired God to forgiue them, that euer they made it, that euer they thought it? But that other fault of theirs that followed heereon, farre exceeded. For therein they actually gaue, euen as it were, diffinitiue sentence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst God himselfe: preferring that vngratefull, and false, and blasphemous, and vile report of those searchers of theirs, vnto that which God himselfe in his most certaine, and inviolable truth, had before deliuered vnto them. And then brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king through the bounds of all loyalty, yea and of all modesty, and of all good na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <note place="margin">Deut. 1: 27</note> too, they charge God that hee hath done it of hatred vnto them to destroy them, and to make their wiues and their children a pray to that people: wishing <note place="margin">Num. 14: 1-4. 10. Deut. 1: 28</note> rather they had dyed before they came thither; mutinously banding themselues to make them a Captaine to lead them backe to <hi>Aegypt</hi> againe; and ready to stone all that should stand in their way therein. When he came to punnish, as their faults were two: so were they punnished two wayes also. For whereas first they did not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> rest on that which God had saide vnto them, but leaned so much to the iudgement of men first God himselfe did yeelde that course vnto them, that so they might eat <note place="margin">Num. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

That which is so voyde of History, is almost all the residue of their time in the Wildernesse, vntill the last, or fortith yeare: insomuch that whereas there is yet but one yeare spent, and a little more of the next, since they came out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> there must yet remaine almost eyght and thirty yeares, before the fortith yeare begin to come in.

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> appertaine originally, that we may vndoubtedly thinke, to bee thereunto ascribed, but onely fiue Chapters of the Booke of <hi>Numbers:</hi> beginning with the fifteenth, and ending with the nineteeth of them. Within which compasse, first we haue some thinges that may seeme to come in, partly by occasion of this last Story going be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: then, certaine others, that haue no relation at all, or respect vnto it. Those that seeme to come in, partly by occasion of this last Story going before, are certaine Lawes that immedialy follow: in which we are to consider; first, how they may seem partly to come in, in respect of that last Story aforesaide; then, what they are. They may seem to come in, partly in respect of that Story going before, because they are so specially named to bee such, as doe appertaine vnto that time, when they shall come into the Land which God shall giue them. For being no doubt in great heauinesse now (so many of them as had the grace to consider accordingly of it) as by theyr <note place="margin">Nu. 15: 1, 2, 18</note> owne folly, excluded that good Land which now they might haue entered into: it might bee a speciall comfort vnto them, that heereby God did so plainely giue them to vnderstand, that neuerthelesse he would in time giue it vnto them. And it may very well be, and is most likely, that God himselfe had the selfe-same meaning with him: being euer wont, in the midst of his wrath, to remember his goodnesse, and still to mingle his Iudgements with Mercy. What the Lawes themselues are, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaineth to another place rather to consider: and so wee are heere to leaue them. Those others that haue no relation or respect at all vnto the Story going before, are two Stories, with such thinges as are to them appertaining: one, of him that gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Stickes on the Sabbaoth-day; the other, of a speciall mutinie among them.

And the better vse that men might so make of such trimming vp of their Garments: the more strange and pittifull it is, that for the most part such as most doe in such sort trim-vp their Garments, seeme of all others least to regard to frame their waies according to the Lawes of God. The latter is a lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Story, and hath much more thereunto appertaining: but first of the Story it selfe; then, of those thinges that belong vnto it. In the Story it selfe; first, their fault: then, their punnishment. Their fault was, the most part of it, apparant or plaine: but it may be doubted, that there was more, which neuerthelesse dooth not plainely appeare. That which is apparant or plaine, is, that in so mutinous sort they ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded themselues together, and came and stroue about the Priest-hood, making light <note place="margin">Num. 16: 1-15</note>

That which doth not so plainely appeare, and yet may be doubted to haue lurked in some of them also, is the desire of the gouernment too, because they were of the Tribe of <hi>Ruben,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ibid. 1.</note> that were pertakers in this action <hi>(Ruben</hi> being by his birth, the eldest Son of <hi>Iacob,</hi> and so hauing some pretence that way, to be somthing forth-putting about it) &amp; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause these did find fault with <hi>Moses</hi> gouernment: and so is it the iudgment of some.

A good patterne to be kept in remembrance of all such as are rebellious or mutinous persons, and of all their adhaerentes with them. Of those thinges that belong to this Story, one there is, that necessarily and plainely belongeth vnto it: and others besides, that lesse or more may seeme likewise to haue their dependance on it. That which necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily and plainely belongeth vnto it, is the same that next doth follow: how God by the Miracle of <hi>Aarons</hi> Rodde or Braunch in one night flourishing, all the others re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining <note place="margin">Num. 17: 1-11</note> voyde as they were before, did establish the Priest-hood vnto him. A ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good figure, that the Priest-hood or Mediation betwixt God and Man, is to bee left to Christ alone: who onely flourisheth in the beauty and fruitfulnesse of holinesse and righteousnesse; all others being but helplesse stayes, fruitlesse branches, and rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten stickes before him. Those others besides that seeme to haue lesse or more their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> dependance hereon, are all that remaine of these fiue Chapters: and first, howe the people may seeme to be by these thinges affected; then, what course it pleased God to take thereupon.

Of themselues, onely two Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries: one, of one person only; the other, of many. That which is of one person only, <note place="margin">Num. 20: 1.</note> is of <hi>Miriam,</hi> or <hi>Marie,</hi> the Sister of <hi>Moses</hi> &amp; <hi>Aaron;</hi> whose Story is, that now shee died heere: a patterne and warning what others might looke for, that yet remained of the old people, when as God now beginneth to lay downe those that were neerest vnto him.

Neuerthelesse, there be that are of opinion that she was such an one indeed, as we may well if shee were such (and it is certaine she was a Prophetesse) account her to be very deare vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <note place="margin">Exod. 15: 20. <hi>Rab. Salomon. Lyr: in</hi> Num. 20: 1.</note> God. For they say she was a very good one: and that for her sake we do not find of a long time before, but that the people had water inough, whereas now imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately after her death they wanted. That which is of many, doth follow immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately after: a speciall great murmuring againe for want of water; but their neede quickly and strangely supplied. Their murmuring now did not only touch them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues: but it set <hi>Moses</hi> also out of temper, driuing him to some impaciencie too. As it touched themselues onely, their fault was great: not seeking to the Lord in <note place="margin">Num. 20. 2-8</note> that their necessity; but misliking of his gouernment, despairing of his goodnesse, and laying the blame on those his seruants. Whereupon <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling <note place="margin">Ibid. 6. 8. Ibid 9-11.</note> themselues vnto the Lord, were by and by directed what course to take, to make supply. But being thus directed, and readily setting in hand to make supply, thetein they did so farre offend, that now they also are for it excluded the Land: though notwithstanding the people had their necessitie releeued. But two things there are, that here wold be more specially noted: one, what was this fault of <hi>Moses</hi> &amp; <hi>Aaron;</hi> the other, that neuertheles the people were holpen. What was their fault it is good to marke, seeing they were for it excluded, as well as the others that more offended. In searching out what their fault should be, so farre as it respecteth the Rod that was now to be vsed, the matter is not great, that there is some diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence <note place="margin">Tremel. I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

They account it to be the Rod of <hi>Aaron,</hi> because it was appointed to be laid vp by the Arke for <note place="margin">Nu. 17: 10. 11. Ibid. 20: 9.</note> a memoriall: and because it is saide, that they did take that Rod that they tooke, from before the Lord. And it is not vnlikely, but that, because this had lately bud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and flowred, and had brought forth ripe fruite all in a night, and was of fresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er remembrance than was the other, and not otherwise brought forth to vse againe <note place="margin">Num. 17. 10.</note> that we do read of (and yet was willed before to be kept for a remembrance to the children of Israel, and to cause their murmuring to cease) this indeed might well be the Rod that is spoken of now: though it be not vnlikely neither, but that <hi>Moses</hi> after that he saw that it pleased God so to worke by that other Rod or staffe of his, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> he would not afterward make any vse of it, but leaue it there ready before the Lord still to be vsed as it should please him to appoint it. The Translation of those two former is such, as seemeth rather to point to <hi>Aarons</hi> Rod: but neither the vulgar <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> before, nor <hi>Fra. Vatablus, Arias Montanus,</hi> nor Master <hi>Caluine</hi> since, doe finde any matter in the originall. But the fault of <hi>Moses</hi> was his behauiour at the Rocke. For wheras they were willed to take that Rod with them, and, in the sight and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the Elders of Israel, to speake to the Rocke to giue the people water, as ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well assured that it should so be: <hi>Moses</hi> now doth not speake to the rocke as he <note place="margin">Num. 20: 7. 11</note> was directed, but mooued with the peoples vnrulines in that perturbation of his mind within, himselfe did make some doubt of it, whether they shold do it or not, and together with his impatient and doubfull speeches with the Rod that then hee had, he smote the rocke twice, wherevpon gushed out plenty of water; and <hi>Aaron</hi> all this while being by, did nothing at all better that defectiue course of his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:7530:101"/> So farre were they both at that time from going about their businesse, with that moderation towards the people and confidence in God; and therefore char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, that they did not glorifie him: as giuing them to vnderstand thereby, that though all the people had thus murmured, and were euer doubtfull that God did forget them; yet should they as better acquainted with his waies, and most assured of his mindfulnesse of them, most resolutely and with a mighty courage assure them, that he could not forget them, and now did no more but onely make some proofe of their faith, and occasion them to call vpon him. If <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron</hi> were excluded for this, many of vs had neede to take heede. That, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> were so defectiue heere, yet pleased it God euen by their Ministery so farre slipped by them, or at least so hardly performed, to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the want of the people, it is a very good lesson to vs, that neither in the worde nor Sacraments, is the force of Gods operation to vs-ward impaired, though the Ministers them-selues bee vnwoorthy. In the dealing that heere they had with others, we are to learne, moderately to put vp such vnkindnesse as others may of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer vnto vs, farre otherwise than wee would thinke that we should. Which that we may the better perceiue, we are to note, what cause they had to bee offended: and, how they did quietly put it vp notwithstanding. The cause that they had <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> to be offended, was, that sending first to the <hi>Edomites</hi> their Bretheren (for those <note place="margin">Nu. 20: 14-18</note> were a people descended of <hi>Esau,</hi> as these of <hi>Iacob)</hi> to obtaine license to passe tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough their Lande, because it was a great deale their neerest way; and when the <hi>Edomites</hi> made danger at it, either on behalfe of the <hi>Canaanites</hi> their neighbours dwelling within them, or of their own security in it, then they assured them besides, <note place="margin">Ibid. 19-21.</note> that they would but passe the high street only, &amp; truly pay for whatsoeuer they had or tooke, euen for the water that themselues and their Cattle did drink: yet, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding that their consanguinity before, &amp; their reasonable offer now, they would in no wise affoord them that courtesie and kindnesse that now they desired. That they did quietly put it vp notwithstanding, it appeareth not onely in this, that then they quietly turned a-side from thence, and went that farther way about: but <note place="margin">Ibid. 21.</note> also for that when the Lord had warned them before, that they should not med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with any part of their Dominions, yet neuerthelesse telling them then, that he <note place="margin">Deut. 2: 4, 5.

And so the Lord giuing his people victory against them, they performed their promise so fully, that the place it selfe did afterward take the name thereof, as a place accursed vnto the Lorde, or for his sake altogether abandoned to vtter destruction. A good patterne vnto them, how farre the people of God by such bad dealing (for they did not prouoke them first) may bee so far enraged, that resolutely they may bend themselues to the vtter destruction of such Enemies of theirs: and that God himselfe, that is most mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull, may neuerthelesse in such case abandon all Mercy too: and that, if now they were so little able to stand in their hands, when yet they were not to enter in, much lesse should they afterward doe it when that time came; and therefore a faire call of them to repentance nowe. Againe, it seemeth wee may probably gather thereby, that although the <hi>Edomites</hi> would in no wise suffer the <hi>Israelites</hi> to passe by them to the Land that God would giue them: yet were they content to let those <hi>Canaanites</hi> passe by them, so to assault the <hi>Israelites</hi> as they did.

In which their iourney, they had no notable stay till they came to the plaine of <hi>Moab,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Num 21: 4, 10 20, 36: 13.</note> ouer against <hi>Iericho,</hi> where they were to make their entry: but for our part of this meane time betwixt, some part of that sentence or iudgement of God of their perri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing there in the Wildernesse, seeme to remained as yet vnaccomplished; but then shortly after it seemeth, that it was performed vnto them. Vntill the time it was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished, they tasted now and then of some seuerity as they gaue occasion: but after that, it seemeth his Iustice was satisfied for that matter; he still dealt so gracious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with them. They tasted of some seuerity as they gaue occasion, at two seuerall times: one, in the beginning of this their iourney; the other, after they were come to the plaine of <hi>Moab</hi> aforesaide. In the beginning of this their iourney, they murmured againe, because of the way; but then, as their manner was, they put in <note place="margin">Num. 21: 4. 5.</note> their other discontentments withall: as that they were brought out of <hi>Aegypt;</hi> and had neither Bread nor Water there; and that they were so cloyed with <hi>Manna,</hi> that now their stomackes did vtterly loath it. But seeing it was the way, whereat they tooke occasion first to murmure, it may seeme to be, that they were grieued that they
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:7530:102"/> might not make their entrance into the Land there where they were now, hauing made so good an impression into it already, by vanquishing King <hi>Arad,</hi> and destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Citties: but now must leaue that faire opportunity, and all that labour, and go about again they cannot tell whither. But the truth is, that God therein prouided better for them, than they were aware of, by this meanes giuing them two other <note place="margin">Ibid 24, 25, 31, 35.</note> Kingdomes more than he promised, as afterward the Story will shew; yet so long as this was vnknown vnto them, needs must it be a strong temptation, but only to such as were very well assured of the goodnesse of God towards them. Their punishment <note place="margin">Num. 21: 6.</note> for this matter was, that there was sent in vpon them a kind of Serpent (that which is properly called the <hi>Dipsas,)</hi> as it seemeth beeing a Greeke word, and comming of <gap reason="foreign">

A strange and fearefull kinde of punishment: but yet so much the meeter for those that hauing so good experience of the wisedome and goodnesse of God to them-wards, could onely vpon the sence of their owne reason so hardly censure his gouernment of them, and so vily reproach it besides. At length they were sorry and sought his fauour. Yet then, though <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>

               <note place="margin">Num. 21: 7-9</note> entreated for them, he would not take those Serpents from them, as he had quite remooued other plagues before: but onely would giue them a remedy against them, by that brazen Serpent which hee willed <hi>Moses</hi> to erect for them; vouchsafing, that all that were stung with those fiery Serpents, as soone as they looked on this, should then recouer. A needefull document, in some good time to make an ende of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, least God at the length take such a course with vs also: not at any time to take away from vs any such plague, as for our sinne he casteth vpon vs, but onely to helpe so many as seeke vnto him; and not these neither, till so they doe. A notable Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of Christ likewise; who beeing altogether without sinne, yet in the similitude of sinfull Flesh, hath by his death destroyed the power of sinne (vnto those, that here in the Wildernesse of this World, themselues feeling the burthen of sinne, seeke vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him to be eased of it:) but afterward is the abolishing or breaking of it, recorded among the vertues of one of the good Kinges of <hi>Iudah,</hi> for that the people had then <note place="margin">2. King. 18: 4.</note> vsed to doe worship vnto it; and so teacheth vs thereby, that our Superiors also doe wel, when they remooue such stumbling blockes out of the way. How they tasted <note place="margin">Num. 22: 1.</note> of his seuerity againe in the plaine of <hi>Moab,</hi> is a larger Storie, hauing many other thinges going before, as the occasion of that their sinne, and punishment of it. So are wee first to consider of the occasion of it: then, of that their falling into the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure of God. The occasion of it was, that vnhappy counsell that <hi>Balaam</hi> is saide to haue giuen against the people of God, when <hi>Balak</hi> the King of <hi>Moab,</hi> had a little before sent for him to some such purpose. Where againe we are to consider, what it was that occasioned the King of <hi>Moab</hi> so to doe: and what it was that hee and others did thereuppon. That which occasioned him thereunto, was the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of those two Kinges that dwelt neere vnto him: <hi>Sihon,</hi> King of the <hi>Ammo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites;</hi> and <hi>Og,</hi> the King of <hi>Basan.</hi> Whose Story is this. When the people came to the boarders of those <hi>Amorites,</hi> they sent vnto one of those Kinges, to him that <note place="margin">Nu 21: 21, 22.</note> was next them, to craue licence to passe through his Land in peaceable manner. Who not onely denied them, but also came foorth with his forces against them. So was <note place="margin">Ibid. 24-32.</note> he and his people ouerthrowne, and his Citties and Townes, with all the spoyle, faln into the handes of the <hi>Israelites.</hi> After which the people going on forward to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Bashan, Og</hi> the King thereof came out likewise against them with all his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, <note place="margin">Ibid. 33-35.</note> whom also they slew, and possessed themselues of al that they had. That which the K. of <hi>Moab</hi> did heereupon, was, that doubting he could not make his part good <note place="margin">Num. 22: 2-4</note> with them by plaine force, he would assay (as that great Vsurper at <hi>Rome</hi> doth, against <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> those Princes and peoples that professe the Gospell) what hee could doe by other se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret and wicked practises. He aduiseth himselfe of a certaine Prophet as it seemeth, in <hi>Mesopotamia,</hi> but he belike making no other reckoning of him, than as of Wiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard or Wise-man (as we commonly tearm them) whom he thought to be very skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in the Blacke-Art (as we tearme it) or very expert to be witch or enchant as plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:7530:103"/> him: and so he would see, whether he in this case could any way helpe him. Hee communieateth this his aduice with the <hi>Midianites</hi> his Neighbours by: who li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king well of it, ioyne with him therein. So they send vnto him men of speciall reckoning in both those Nations, with the accustomed reward of Sooth-saying (so <note place="margin">Ibid. 5-7.</note> much, no doubt, more liberall now, as they thought it lay them in hand, now to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of him the best helpe that he had) to bestow vpon him for that present, and to loade <note place="margin">Ibid. 37. Ibid. 8-14.</note> him with great promises besides (as it seemeth) for the time to come. They come vnto him, hee enquireth of the Lord (whereby it seemeth, hee was a Prophet indeede, though not so good a man, as best might become so holy a calling) and finding that God was in no wise willing that he should accurse them, hee refuseth to goe with them, and doth so dismisse them. The King, not so content, sendeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, <note place="margin">Ibid. 15-21</note> and greater Personages than before; and with great promises besides: the Prophet would faine goe; but not vnlesse the Lord would giue him leaue. He try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth againe, and doth obtaine it: but yet on condition, he should goe no farther than hee did allow him. The Prophet is a glad Man; hee getteth vp betime, and goeth <note place="margin">Ibid 21-35.</note> with them: as a Bloodhound on his game, he hotly pursueth the scent of promotion. But nowe the Lorde thought good to schoole him by the way, and to bring him to better temper: and so hee did, vsing also the Ministery of his Asse therein. <hi>Balak</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ibid. 36-41.</note> being aduertised that <hi>Balaam</hi> was comming, be goeth to the vtmost borders of his Land to meete him (a rare honour in these dayes, by such great States, to bee done to such Seruants of God:) he expostulateth with him his not comming before; but taketh him home with him, and the next day they set in hand with their businesse. Their manner of working was, by many sacrificings, now in one place, now in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and by much deuotion of that kinde, to assay if they could obtaine the fauour of God, to ioyne with them in this their desire. But they could not obtaine it: and in stead of cursing that was intented, they were faine to yeelde them (when they had <note place="margin">Ibid. 23, 24: 13.</note> often assaied, and done therein what they were able) a very great, and immutable blessing. Such, no doubt, is, and long hath beene, euen our case also: euen of all <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> such, as nowe in these daies more sincerely professe the Gospell. Many times, and very busily haue the aduersaries beene attempting against vs, and by much baser and more wicked meanes than these: as for Massinges in euery corner, and <hi>Ora pro nobis,</hi> in the open audience of all, there hath no store of them beene wanting.

This being done, it seemeth his Iustice was now satisfied towards his people, for that their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity and disobedience (almost forty years since) at <hi>Kadesh. Barnea,</hi> for that now hence-forward we haue no me so fearefull and grieuous executions of them, but very milde and gracious dealing a long time after, all his dealing with them (in a manner) boading now, that he had kept them long enough in the Wildernes, and that now he would straight-way bring them into the Land that long before hee promised vnto them: some of his dealing (notwithstanding) not so plainely as yet shewing the same; but other tending more directly vnto it. Such of his dealing with them since, as doth not so plainly import that matter, is part of it such order as he tooke in diuers things now: and partly in certaine Lawes which it pleased him now to giue them, or at least to put them in minde thereof being giuen before. The order that now it pleased him to take in diuers things, was most of it publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or openly done: but more priuately the other.

Wherein also we haue one thing spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially noted vnto vs: namely, that of all these thus numbred by <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Elea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ibid. 63-65.</note> now, there was not one man left of those that were numbered before, sauing onely those two that had that promise before made them, <hi>Iosuah</hi> and <hi>Caleb.</hi> That which concerned certaine of them, was, that by occasion that <hi>Zelophehad,</hi> one of <note place="margin">Ibi 33. 27: 1-7</note> the Tribe of <hi>Manasses,</hi> had no Sonnes but Daughters onely, and they (being fiue) came and made request to <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Eleazar,</hi> and to the Princes of the people, that they might not be neglected, but haue some portion of the Land vnto them as others had: it was by the Lord himselfe ordained, both that they shoulde haue <note place="margin">Ibi. 27: 8-11.</note> their part of the Land aswell as the rest; and that it should be a perpetuall Law a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, that if any had no Sonnes but Daughters, then should his Daughters inhaerit before any other of his Kindred or bloode. A manifest checke vnto the course that the Children of this world do commonly vse: rather to make choise of some of their name, though they be not so neere in blood; than to suffer their lands to descend vnto their daughters. And whereas the Lorde him-selfe acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth, that the Daughters of <hi>Zelophehad,</hi> demanded no more but their right there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in: it may be the other course is before God a manifest wrong.

Now, in that it pleased God, by that occasion to take that order at this present, it might be enough to lift vp their minds to this good hope, that now shortly the Land was to be diuided among them. That which was more priuately done, was, that <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ibid. 12-17:</note> being tolde by the Lord, that shortly now hee should go vp to the Mount <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barim</hi> and there die, when first he had seene the Lande that God would giue vnto the people, <hi>Moses</hi> then besought the Lord to aduise himselfe of one to gouern the people after him: and the Lord againe told him whom he would haue, &amp; in what <note place="margin">Ibid. 18-23.</note> sort he should be called vnto it. The Lawes that it pleased him now to giue them, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> were most of them as touching his publicke worship in the Sanctuary: but some of them, but onely about their priuat deuotion at home: but as we sayd of the others before, so are we to resolue of these also; namely, to reserue them to another place much fitter for them. Such of the Lords dealing with them as more directly ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to shew, that they were shortly now to enter the Land promised vnto them, doth first concerne some of the people of those parts by them: then, their owne affayres about the same.

Another example of the seuerity of Gods Iustice, against such as are greeuous vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his people: as these enticing them vnto sinne, made many of them to bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed. The order that now (in the Nature of Lawes) was in diuers thinges ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with them, was some part of it such as wherein it seemeth the Lordes minde was, that in such cases so they should do afterward also: some part again, but such as was prescribed but in this case only, but such as out of which themselues might well take direction in other such like cases besides. Those that in such case were, as it seemeth, to stand stil, were two: one, for themselues that came from the wars; the other, for the booty that they brought with them. As touching themselues <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> that came from the warre, because they had saued the married women and men-children aliue, it seemeth as yet, <hi>Moses</hi> was offended with them, and bad them go <note place="margin">Nu. 31: 13-20▪ 24.</note> and slay them also: and, for a time to tarry without the hoast, and to purify them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues and their garments too, according to the Lawe. As touching the bootie which they brought with them, it it no more but this, that <hi>Eleazar</hi> she Priest doth shew them how it also was to bee purged: the mettall by fire (a good way withall to abolish such superstition, wantonnesse, and vanity, as it is not vnlikely but that <note place="margin">Nu. 31. 21-23</note> many of their Iewels were stained withall) the rest by water. That which it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:7530:104"/> was but for that time onely, but out of which themselues might well take di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection in such other cases besides, was the diuision of the rest of their bootie (or that which was left, after that they tarried out of the hoast as was appointed:) and therein, how the High-Priest was to be considered out of the one part of it; &amp; the <hi>Leuites</hi> out of the other. It was to be parted into two equall parts: one, to the Souldiers themselues; the other, vnto the rest of the people. Of that which <note place="margin">Ibid. 25. 41.</note> fell vnto the Souldiers, the High-Priest was to haue, of euery fiue hundred, one: and so his part was 675. Sheepe; 72. Beeues; 61. Asses; young women. 32. Of that which fell to the rest of the people, the <hi>Leuites</hi> were to haue, one of euerie fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <note place="margin">Ibid. 42-47.</note> and so ten times so much among them all, as <hi>Eleazar</hi> had to himselfe alone: that is, of Sheepe, 6750; of Beeues, 720; of Asses, 610; yong women, 320. Such of the Lords dealing as concerned their owne affaires there, did partly respect that side of the Countrey where now they were: but chiefely the other which was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond <hi>Iordan,</hi> whether shortly they were to go. As it respected that side of the Countrey where now they were, some part of it was about the setling of some of them there: and some part againe, about that long iourney of theirs, that now they were at a point to finish. About the setling of some there, it was that two Tribes and an halfe were allowed, on certaine conditions, to haue their portions on that <note place="margin">Nu. 32: 1-4<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </note> side of the Riuer: a good and probable likely-hoode, that now the rest also were soone to be placed, when as these had their places allowed heere. But as it may seeme, it was not so well moued by these: nor so well graunted by the others ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Not so well moued by these, because they diuided themselues thereby (so farre as they did) from the rest of their Brethren: and there-in from the Tribe of <hi>Iudah,</hi> and from the exercise of their Religion. Not so well granted of the others neither, because they knew not yet, what people they should neede to inhabit the Countrey on the other side: and needfull it was, that they had enow to inhabit it, that so they might better expell the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> euen by their multitude, not lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing them place to inhabit there. If any had spared, they might haue taken the best to themselues, and haue left the rest vnto them: but so themselues might haue <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> kept and dwelt together, which in many good respects had been the meetest; both for the one, and for the other. And not onely <hi>Moses</hi> did nowe soone after tell <note place="margin">Deu. 7: 1. 9: 11</note> them, that those which inhabited there before, were a greater people than they, (and then were all those few enow there to inhabit:) but God himselfe also tolde them in effect as much before, by giuing them to vnderstand, that they had neede <note place="margin">Exo. 23: 29. 30</note> to bee encreased to a greater number before they should bee enow to furnish the Land with Inhabitants sufficient for it to beare. That which was about that long iourney of theirs that now they were at a point to finish, was, that now by Gods <note place="margin">Nu. 33: 1-49.</note> appointment all their iourneyes and places of their aboad or Stations, were to be set duwne by <hi>Moses,</hi> which also hee did: a very good token to them, that now their iournying was almost at an end, when thus their iournies were to be set downe; as in casting an account, it is a Token, that the particulars are all come in, when the totall summe is gathering. A good patterne also to them and to vs too, what manner of Pilgrimage we haue heere in this worlde: oft changing our Stati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but euery where (lightly) leauing some token of our folly behinde vs: would God it were so, that we neuer remoued nor setled againe, but onely as the Lorde should direct vs. Such of his dealings as respect the other side, whether now shortly they were to go, doo some of them concerne the whole people: and some, but certaine of them onely. Those of his dealinges with them that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne them all generally, are two: one, about the ridding of the Lande from the former Inhabitants of it; the other, about diuiding or parting of it among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues. If the charge be now so specially giuen them to destroy or driue out al the inhabitants of the Land, it is a plaine token, that God doth meane them it nowe: <note place="margin">Nu. 33: 50-56.</note> and in that they were willed to driue them out for their owne good, it is a speciall good warning to vs when we come to professe Christ, so to deale with our home-enemies, the motions of our corrupt Nature; and to all Magistrates besides, to cleere their people (so much as they may) of all the enemies of the Gospell among
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:7530:105"/> them. For the diuiding of it among them, he first dooth shew them what it is, <note place="margin">Ibid. 34: 1-15 Ibid. 16-29.</note> that so they might diuide it among them: then, who they are that should diuide it. If now they haue so speciall charge of diuiding it among themselues, that also is an euident probability, that now shortly they are to enioy it. And seeing the bounds that are set downe vnto it, doo plainly shew, that the whole Land that God did yet meane them, lay on the West side of <hi>Iordan,</hi> and the Dead-Sea, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending vnto the great Sea (which since is called the <hi>Middle-earth-Sea)</hi> West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; as also, from <hi>Edom</hi> on the South, to <hi>Lib<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="3 letters">

For although the bounds of the Land be extended East-ward sometimes to <hi>Euphrates,</hi> yet, because now, when they are to enter, and to diuide so much among them as the Lord dooth meane them, it is all on the West side of <hi>Iordan,</hi> that he speaketh of vnto them: it rather seemeth, that those places are not to be taken, as though the dwelling of the body of the people should at any time extend so farre, or any thing neere (for then, for the truth of the promise of God, by likely-hood there would haue beene some order now also taken for it) but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that a time should be, when their Dominions should be so farre extended, as af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward <note place="margin">2. Sam. 8: 3. 1. King. 4: 21 2. Chro. 9: 16. Esra, 4: 20.</note> it is true they were, albeit the same lasted but for a while. True it is, that <hi>Moses</hi> to the people, and God vnto <hi>Iosuah</hi> in those places before recited, doo both so farre extend the boundes of the Land, after that the two Tribes of <hi>Ruben</hi> and <hi>Gad,</hi> and that halfe Tribe of <hi>Manasseh</hi> had made their request for that part of the Land on the East of <hi>Iordan,</hi> and had the same granted vnto them: &amp; so might some conceiue, that the bounding of the Land on the West side of <hi>Iordan</hi> was fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med accordingly, on presupposall, that those others should haue their places be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and it should be onely for the nine Tribes and an halfe that remained. But the truth is, that although <hi>Moses</hi> did vtter those words after, yet in the former of those two places of his, he doth but recite the speech of the Lord which was vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red long before, almost in the beginning of the second yeare of that their pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, as it appeareth by the next verse immediately going before. So it seemeth <note place="margin">Deut. 1: 6.</note> that the abounding of the land on the West of <hi>Iordan,</hi> was not, as onely for those nine Tribes and an halfe that remained: but for them all, for the bodie of their dwelling; and so for those other two and an halfe also if so they would, but that they now had rather haue their place on that other side of <hi>Iordan</hi> as is declared. And so do their owne words seeme to import also, when as they make so speciall sute for it, and in that respect renounce their part beyond <hi>Iordan:</hi> plainly imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <note place="margin">Num. 32▪ 5, 19, 32.</note> that that part onely which was beyond <hi>Iordan,</hi> was that which was ordained for them; for all the whole people generally, and so for them also among the rest.

Which was, that measuring out two thousand Cubits right from the walles, the next halfe of these, or one thousand of them next to the walles, should bee to
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:7530:105"/> the common vse of all the Citty, but not to build on, but to reserue such a space about them to other vses, and for their exercise and pleasure: and the farther thousand of these two, to bee for the <hi>Leuites,</hi> peculiar and propper to them for theyr Cattle. Out of which Leuiticall Citties hee ordained likewise, that there should bee sixe of <note place="margin">Num. 35: 6, 9-15.</note> them (three on the one side, and three on the other of the Riuer <hi>Iordan)</hi> set out also for Citties of refuge: and setting downe the vse of them; he doth by that occasion set downe certaine thinges likewise concerning the shedding of bloud. The vse of them was, that if it shoulde at any time so fall out (as it was like ouer often to be) one man should slay another, then might he, for his owne safety, haue some place of refuge, till his cause might come to indifferent hearing: and not be tumultuously slaine by some Kinsman and friend of the other party, in that their heate, as otherwise it is often seen. But whereas we see here, that there are allowed as many Citties of refuge to the East-side of <hi>Iordan,</hi> as to the west (in length, indeed, teaching almost as far as the other, but in breadth, but about the fourth part of it, &amp;, as it seemeth, scant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly so much) out of this may be probably gathered, both that there was like to bee as much disorder of that kinde, in that one quarter as in all the rest besides (and that might bee so the rather, for that the chiefe publike exercise of their Religion was to to be on the other side, whereunto they could not, as now they placed themselues, so well repaire:) and that this might haue beene a faire warning vnto them, not so easily to diuide themselues so far from their Bretheren as now they did, euen in that respect also, though there had beene none other but it. Those thinges, that by this occasion are set downe concerning the shedding of bloud, are in effect but to shew, in what case such protection by those Cities of refuge was to be allowed: &amp;, in what case not. But then by occasion thereof, there are diuers particulars besides: some <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="N"/> of them most respecting such as should iudge of those cases; others, most respecting the parties themselues. To such as should Iudge in those cases it was prescribed, that if any might seeme vnto them, rather to haue deserued death, than to haue such protection allowed, yet that no man should be so condemned, vppon the witnesse of <note place="margin">Ibid. 30.</note> one man onely: and when they had found, whether a man were to dye, or to bee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed that protection, then were they to doe execution accordingly, and in no wise <note place="margin">Ibid. 31-34▪</note> to take any ransome or fine of such offenders, eyther for sparing of their liues, or to enlarge them from the praecinctes of their refuge-Citties. For the parties them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues it was prouided, that they had no protection, but onely within the praecinctes of those Citties: and, that there they were to abide during the the life of the High-Priest <note place="margin">Ibid. 26-28. Ibi 25. 28, 32</note> that then was. A comfortable figure of the death of Christ our High-Priest, to all such as are distressed about their sinne: and, a reasonable plaine warning with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, that the more wee are partakers of that annointing with him, the readier should wee bee hence to depart, when as by affoording such Malefactors the benefite of his <note place="margin">Ibid. 25.</note> death, his life must needes be so much the more in danger by this. For the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>Zelophead,</hi> the order that was taken, was, not onely for them, but for all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers also that should afterward bee in such like case, as wherein these were now: namely, that whereas, by order taken before, they did inherit, now was it prouided <note place="margin">Nu. 36: 1-22</note> for likewise, that they should not marry out of their own Tribe (and that so it should be for all others also) that so the Land of any one Tribe, might neuer goe foorth to be ioyned vnto another. Which, it may be, might likewise proue a notable good bar, to the immeasurable greedinesse of diuers, if in other States, or among other peoples it were vsed likewise, that by such means no land should be as it were transported, out of one Prouince, county, or Shire, vnto those that haue their chiefe aboad in another.</p>
            <p n="5">5. In their Story of the last two monthes aforesaide, we are to see; first, howe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
               <hi>Moses</hi> maketh an end of his course: then, how <hi>Ioshuah</hi> beginneth his. As touching <hi>Moses,</hi> being already put out of doubt, that he should not goe in with them into the Land, and being very iealous of them, that after his time they would be in danger to fall away to Idolatry, he thought good, now to labour them so much as he could, to leaue them (as it were) fast vnto God: and God likewise doth helpe him forward in the same course, before that he doth take him from among them. So are we first to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
               <pb n="188" facs="tcp:7530:106"/> consider of those his imployments: then, how hee finished his course among them. Those his imploymentes were all of God, and all occasioned by the brittlenesse of the people, all being to this ende directed, so to establish and settle, and so to leaue the people with God, as best might helpe so to keep them, that neuer after they shold fal from him again: first, by such things, as he would presently haue to be done among them; then, by one other that he wold haue left vnto thē for the time ensuing. Those things that he would presently haue to be done among them, were two: one, that they should be specially called vpon, to keep fast vnto God; the other, that he would haue the couenant, that was made betwixt God &amp; them, now to be (on his part) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed again. For the former, as God would haue it, so doth <hi>Moses</hi> set himself to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme <note place="margin">D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="3 letters">

By his owne speach vnto them, he so laboureth them in it, that whosoeuer doth but a little enter into the consideration of it, may reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble plainely perceiue therein, that he doth it not onely as directed thereunto of God, but also, out of his owne most inward and heartie affection withall; bestowing a notable farewell vpon them therein, and so earnestly labouring them about it, that it is most euident, himselfe was desirous of it. A very good example to all that are in yeares, or any way else finde themselues to bee wearing away, to be carefull, before they goe hence, to leaue all such as they leaue behind them, especially those of whom they haue a more speciall charge, as fast vnto God as possibly they are able to doe: and not to bestow their whole care on that behalfe of those they haue, and that lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle time that then is left them, onely about ordering (as most men doe) their earthlie affaires and estate vnto them. But the common sort of men are so voide of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse themselues, that it is no maruell if wee finde no such thing in their deathes when as their liues were altogether destitute of it. In what sort <hi>Moses</hi> did labour them in it, to the end that we may the better finde, we are more specially to looke in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the course hee obserued therein, and so wee shall finde, that although hee diuers times intermingle one with another, as the earnest affection of his owne hart (both in good will towardes them, and for the loue of the businesse hee had in hand) did now and then lead him: yet, for the most part hee dooth first earnestly exhort and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour them to continue in that their duty and seruice to God; and then dooth put them in minde likewise of many of those thinges, wherein that duty or seruice of theirs was to be performed. When he doth exhort and labour them in it, yet doth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> hee both put them in minde of diuers fauours of God towardes them before: and himselfe earnestly mooueth them to doe their duty, and to persist and abide therein. The fauours of God towards them before, that he doth put them in minde of now, were, one of them in <hi>Aeygpt,</hi> and in the Wildernesse ioyned together: the others, in the Wildernesse onely. That one in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and in the Wildernesse ioyntly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, was, that whereas they went downe thither but onely threescore and tenne <note place="margin">Gen. 46: 27. Deut. 10: 22.</note> persons, God had brought them now to bee like to the Starres of Heauen for multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude: being then, as wee saw before in the last Section but this, aboue 600000. able men to the fielde. Those others that were in the Wildernesse onely, were, some of them of farther remembrance: and some, much neerer. Those that were of farther remembrance, we may account to be all such as were before they were turned backe againe into the Wildernesse, when otherwise they had liberty giuen them to haue entered into the Land of Promise, and were mooued so to haue done: and of these we finde, that he maketh mention of one which was before the Law also was giuen; and others after. That which hee mentioneth now, and yet was done before the Law was giuen, was that better order that hee tooke with them for the hearing and determining of their Causes and Controuersies, and for the better gouernment of them all generally, by aduise of <hi>Iethro</hi> his Father in Law, as we saw before. Those <note place="margin">Ex. 18: 13-26 Deut. 1: 9-17.</note> which were after the Lawe was giuen, were, some of them ensuing thereon: and some againe, about that their turning backe into the Wildernesse. Such as ensued the giuing of the Law, were two: one, about a motion that themselues then made; the other, about a great sinne, that shortly after they committed. The motion that themselues then made, was, that being affraid of that fearefull voice of God, they <note place="margin">Ex. 20▪ 18-21.</note>
               <pb n="189" facs="tcp:7530:106"/> now desired, that God would speake no more to them, but onely shew his mind vnto <note place="margin">Deut. 1: 18. 4: 10▪ 14. 15: 22-27.</note>
               <hi>Moses,</hi> and that they would doe, as he should direct them: which also was granted vnto them. That which was about the sinne, that shortly after they committed, was, that when they had worshipped the golden Calfe, and the Lord was so offended with them, that hee would haue destroyed them for it, hee did earnestly entreat for <note place="margin">Ex. 32: 11▪ 14, 31, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="6">6. As touching the Couenant which was made with them before, and God <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> would now haue renewed againe, we haue no actuall renewing of it on behalfe of the people: but onely on the behalfe of God. And it may bee, that the actuall consent of the people, is not so much regarded now, because of their great frailtie or brittlenesse in cleauing to God, so often declared: and therefore, that God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenteth himselfe, by the Ministry of <hi>Moses</hi> to shew them, that he notwithstanding is the same towards them that he was before; and so now reneweth the selfe-same Couenant that he did make with them before. So first he putteth them in minde what experience they haue already had of him, as a thing that should so fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent them, as that now they should make no question of him: then, he laboureth them, that they would accordingly cleaue vnto him. The experience that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready they had of him, was part of it in their Fathers dayes: and part, in their own. That which was in their Fathers dayes was that woonderfull and fearefull dealing <note place="margin">Deut. 26: 1-4.</note> of his, on their behalfe, in the Land of <hi>Aegypt:</hi> so verie notorious, that although
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:7530:108"/> none of those to speake of that then remained were them-selues priuy vnto it, yet was the memorie thereof (euen to that day) so fresh among them, that none of them all could be ignorant of it; and yet that they were euen to that day so sencelesse therein, that they notwithstanding were little or nothing the better for it. That which they had in their owne time, and whereunto themselues were priuie, was part of it in that long iourney of theirs in the Wildernesse: and part of it there, where then they encamped. In the Wildernesse they had found, that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing they had beene held therein forty yeares; and all that time had no repaire <note place="margin">Ibid. 5, 6.</note> of apparrell, nor the helpe of ordinary sustenance: yet neither was that apparrell of theirs yet worne out, not themselues consumed, nor in ill liking for want of the sustenance which then they had not. In that place where then they were, they had found likewise, that God had deliuered those two Kinges of the <hi>Ammorites,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ibid. 7, 8.</note> and all that whole Countrey of theirs, and their Citties into their hands: and that they had alreadie disposed of them, giuing all the same to the two Triber of <hi>Ruben</hi> and <hi>Gad,</hi> and to the one halfe of the Tribe of <hi>Manasses.</hi> Hauing put them in minde of so speciall good experience of him and comming now to labor them, that they would accordingly cleaue vnto him, first he doth it but after an vsuall or or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary manner, laying such matter before them, as might be of force to perswade them: but then he ascendeth to an higher kinde, or much more mightily ariseth vpon them, by shutting vppe with earnest protestations. After an vsual and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary manner he doth it, laying such matter before them as might be of force to perswade them, first by vsing some exhortation, and othet good motiues, so to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> keepe them vnto him, as that neuer they fall away from him: and then, if neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse they should fall from him, that yet they would returne vnto him againe. So to keepe them vnto him, as that neuer they fall away from him, hee first exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth: and then, vseth some reasons to mooue them vnto it. Hee exhorteth them, to haue speciall regarde to the wordes of that Couenant, both to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue <note place="margin">Ibid. 9.</note> and keepe them well: and to practise them in all their wayes; that so they might prosper in all that they doo. His reasons are sorted vnto the matter of the Couenant, which is first set dovvne but generally: then, more specially. Generally, there was no more required of them, but that they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so would enter into Couenant vvith him: and to moue them to it, first he putteth them in minde of their ovvne readinesse thereunto; then, hovv God vvould graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously extend it to their children also. As touching their ovvne readinesse there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto, he putteth them in minde, that novv they are all to that end assembled or gotten together, euen from the highest vnto the lovvest: that hee may establish <note place="margin">Ibid. 10-13.</note> them to be a people vnto himselfe; and that he may be, as before hee svvare vnto their Fathers, a God vnto them. As touching the extending of it vnto their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, he novv also telleth them, that the benefit of this Couenant is not to redound to themselues onely, but also to al their posterity ensuing, euen as fully as to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues. <note place="margin">Ibid. 14-15:</note> More specially it vvas required, that they should not fall from him to any of the Goddes of those Nations: and to that end they vvere put in mind that them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues had seene the vanity and the abhomination of them; and that, if so they should, it would bee an heauy burthen vnto them. As touching that knowledge <note place="margin">Ibid. 16-18.</note> of their owne, they are referred both vnto <hi>Aegypt</hi> where they were borne &amp; bred; &amp; to certaine other Nations by which they passed in that their iourny: being now giuen to vnderstand, that God had therefore let them see the extreame folly and naughtinesse of them, that themselues should neuer make any reckoning of them. That if they should, it would certainly bee an heauy burthen vnto them, it is first set downe but generally: then, more specially. Generally, that it would bee <note place="margin">Ibid. 18.</note> found to be a root, that would bring them forth Gaul and Worme-wood. More specially, first for euery one particular person: then, for the whole, or most part of them. For particular persons, that though such an one might perswade himselfe, that neuerthelesse in so doing he might do well enough: yet certainly the wrath of the Lord should lye sore vpon him, and vtterly root him out from among the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. <note place="margin">Ibid. 19-21.</note> In setting downe how heauy the wrath of God would be vnto them, if the
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:7530:108"/> whole or most part of them should so offend, we are to note, not onely what these iudgements are: but also, in what sort <hi>Moses</hi> slippeth into the mention heereof. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> In noting what the iudgements themselues are, we shall finde, that they are grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous: and then, that whereas there might in the minds of some, arise a doubt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, <hi>Moses</hi> sore-warneth (as it may seeme) how to resolue it. They are noted to be so grieuous and fearefull, that the posterity to come, and very Strangers thereabout <note place="margin">Ibid. 22-28.</note> should all stand astonied thereat: and should readily ascribe it to the sinne of the people that dwelt therein. The doubt that might arise thereof, was, as it seemeth to me, that they had not so grieuously offended, as so grieuous punishments might seeme to import: and to that end it may seeme, that <hi>Moses</hi> doth so directly heere referre things secret to the Lord himselfe; and withall setteth downe the thinges re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed <note place="margin">Ibid. 29.</note> to be the rule that we should follow. It may be also, that hee would giue them to vnderstand thereby, that howsouer they stood excused for all such matters as God had not reuealed vnto them: yet for those that hee had reuealed (and such they were, that he spake of now) they were in no wise to be excused. That <hi>Moses</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ibid. 21, 22.</note> speaking but only of some one particular person or other before, doth neuerthelesse, euen in the next words of all, so speake of punishing the whole land, as if there were some generall Apostacy, of all or of most going before (which he dooth not lay to their charge) it may seeme to be therefore done, to giue them to vnderstand, that if any one of that kinde be borne with or spared, it may bee the ruine, if not of all ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally, yet of so many, as may bring those plagues vpon all. If neuerthelesse they should fall from him, that yet they would returne vnto him againe, he doth not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exhort them thereunto: but also vseth a very good reason (out of the Doctrine it selfe) to moue them vnto it. Being of mind to exhort them to return to the Lord againe, first he layeth a good Ground-worke before: and then, commeth in with <note place="margin">Ibid. 30: 1-7.</note> the exhortation it selfe. The Ground-worke that hee layeth for it before, is, that he putteth them in good assurance, that if then they shall returne vnto him, he will most graciously receiue them againe. His exhortation thereupon is, that therefore <note place="margin">Ibid. 8-10.</note> they would turne vnto him, that so in all things the Lord might blesse them, and do them good. The reason that hee vseth out of the Doctrine it selfe, is the facilitie <note place="margin">Ibid. 11-14.</note> and readinesse of it. He ascendeth vnto an higher kinde, and much more mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly riseth vpon them, by shutting vp with earnest protestations: first, by vrging them to consider, that he hath set before them life and good, death and euill: good if they <note place="margin">Ibid. 15-1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="7">7. That one thing that he would haue left vnto them for the time ensuing, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> was that Song that he appointed <hi>Moses</hi> to deliuer vnto them. Concerning which because it was to serue their vse after his departure, and to bee deliuered vnto them but a little before, therefore haue we some such things first set downe, as best may make the way vnto it: then, we haue the thing it selfe. Those things that we haue first set downe, so to make the readier way vnto it, are such as are first performed by <hi>Moses:</hi> then, some others performed by God. As touching <hi>Moses,</hi> as he knew that he was not long to tarry among them now, so doth he frame his doinges according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: first, as touching the Couenant aforesaide; then, as touching this Song ensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. As touching the Couenant afore-saide, according as God before had willed him, so did he truely deliuer it vnto the people. As touching the Song ensuing, <note place="margin">Deut. 31: 1.</note> that so it may be more welcome vnto them, as comming vnto them in a time most needfull, when he should be taken away from them, he doth not onely tell them of his departure: but doth so imploy himselfe besides, as is correspondent thereunto. In telling them of his departure, both he giueth good reason of it: and doth farther comfort them therein. The reason that for it he gaue them, was, first of his owne <note place="margin">Ibid. 2.</note> disability now, not able any more to do them that seruice he was wont to do, being now an hundred and twenty yeares old (whereas before himselfe had set down, that vsually the age of man was but three-score and ten, and that if his constitution or <note place="margin">Psal 90▪ 16.</note>
               <pb n="194" facs="tcp:7530:109"/> strength was such that he could reach to foure-score yeares, yet would that ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plus be but labour and sorrow:) then, that the Lord had plainely tolde him, that he should not go ouer with them. The farther comfort that hee giueth them <note place="margin">Deut. 31: 2. Ibid. 3.</note> therein, was, from aboue, that the Lord himselfe would go ouer before them, and destroy their enemies before their faces: from beneath, that <hi>Iosuah</hi> should succeed him and go ouer with them, and that the Lord would be with him; and, that they <note place="margin">Ibid. 3-5.</note> should certainly do vnto the people on the other side, as on this side they had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready done to those two Kings of the <hi>Ammorites.</hi> Whereuppon also hee willeth them to plucke vp their hearts: and to bee assured, that God will neither fayle nor <note place="margin">Ibid. 6.</note> forsake them. His employments besides correspondent heereunto, that is, such <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> as did shew he was now drawing away, were two: one, that dealing of his with <hi>Iosuah;</hi> the other his dealing with the Priests the <hi>Leuites</hi> also. His dealing with <hi>Iosuah</hi> now was, that he called him before the people, and there assured him, that <note place="margin">Ibid. 7, 8.</note> he should go ouer with them, that the Lord would be with him, and that he should giue them the land which the Lorde before had promised to giue them. His dealing with the Priests the <hi>Leuites</hi> was, that whereas himselfe had alreadie set downe the Law of God in writing, now dooth he deliuer the same vnto them to <note place="margin">Ibid. 9-13, 24-27</note> keepe, and chargeth them withall, that euery seauenth yeare, in the Feast of Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacles, they gather together the whole people, men, women, and children, yea, and the strangers that soiourned with them also (so Lay-people then, yea wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and children, were accounted such as were to be acquainted with the written word of God then, albeit those things of the Old-Testament, were much harder for their capacity▪ then any thing almost of the New-Testament is since) &amp; that thē they read the Law vnto them, that so the people might both heare it, &amp; learne it of them, that so al things might prosper with them: giuing thē withall to vnderstand, that being so brittle as they were while yet he was with them, he could cōceiue no otherwise of them, but that after his death they wold much more shew themselues in their kind, than yet they had done. As touching God, he willed <hi>Moses</hi> to cal <hi>Iosu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah,</hi> &amp; then both to come together vnto him: at which time the lord first dealt more <note place="margin">Ibid 14, 15.</note> specially with <hi>Moses;</hi> then, with <hi>Iosuah.</hi> His dealing with <hi>Moses</hi> was, to let him vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand, that the time being now at hand, that hee must sleepe with his Fathers, <note place="margin">Ibi. 14, 16-21</note> the people soone after would fall to Idolatry, and should be for the same grieuous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly punnished: therefore his pleasure was, that now they should haue some speciall warning giuen them thereof (so to preserue so many of them as should haue anie care to stand) and that this speciall warning for them should bee contriued into a Song which he would haue him set downe in writing, as he did there giue it vnto him. Which <hi>Moses</hi> also accordingly did. His dealing with <hi>Iosuah</hi> was no more <note place="margin">Ibid. 22.</note> but onely to encourage him, and to assure him, that he should bring the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> into the Land that he before had sworne to giue them. Comming then <note place="margin">Ibid. 23.</note> to the thing it selfe, first he getteth the people together: and then reciteth the song vnto them. To get the people together he imposeth that charge on the Priests <note place="margin">Ibid. 28, 29.</note> the Sonnes of <hi>Leuy,</hi> but especially for the Elders and Officers of them: and giueth vnto them the reason why, both out of their owne common frailty; and out of the wonted hand of God against such dealing. In reciting the Song vnto them, we are to consider, not onely howe <hi>Moses</hi> discharged his duty therein: but also, what is the effect or substance of it. That <hi>Moses</hi> discharged his duty therein, we <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
               <note place="margin">Ibid. 30.</note> are assured, that he deliuered by word of mouth, in the hearing of all the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, the words of that Song vntill he had fully ended the same. The effect or substance of it is, to be a set admonition or warning vnto that people, how euil their wayes were before God: and how bitter fruites in time they would yeelde vnto themselues. Both which things that they might suffer to make deeper impressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in their minds, and so might better conceiue the same, first hee vseth a Praeface or fore-speech thereunto: and then doth come to the matter it selfe. In the Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face he purposely calleth on the heauens and earth to giue eare, as hauing no hope <note place="margin">Deu. 32: 1-3</note> of conuenient audience among men; and appealing to all, whether hee hath not iust cause so to deale with them as he doth: and then both assureth them, that that
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:7530:109"/> which now he hath to say shall be vnto them (if so they can take it) as the comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble dewe of Heauen, to the Plantes that growe on the Earth, and vnto the glory of God; and thereupon requireth of them, that they also giue glory to GOD. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming vnto the matter it selfe; first, hee setteth downe the same bat generally: but then doth prosecute it more specially. Generally, hee giueth them to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, <note place="margin">Ibid. 4, 5.</note> that GOD in all his iudgementes vppon them standeth so cleere, that hee in nothing is to bee charged: but that they had corrupted themselues towardes him; not beeing his Children, but a froward and crooked Generation. More specially; first, hee chargeth them with great sinne: and then denounceth heauy iudgements against them. To the ende they may finde out their sinne the better; first, he sheweth how graciously God hath dealt with them: then, how vnkindly they haue dealt with him againe. As touching the gracious dealing of God with them, he is no sooner entring into the consideration of it, but that hee wondereth, that so they could deale with him againe: and so beginneth with a greeuous expostulation with them about that matter. Then he willeth them to call to minde and to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, <note place="margin">Ibid. 6.</note> that in his secret purpose he did not forget them in the distribution of possessions <note place="margin">Ibid. 7-9.</note> and Countries to other peoples, but at that time also, and nowe shortly to come to light, he prouided for them, though as yet he had not giuen it vnto them: and that, <note place="margin">Ibid. 10-14.</note> when they were in neede and destitute, hee supplyed their necessity, and in the ende brought them vnto a rich and wealthy estate. As touching their vnkinde dealing <note place="margin">Ibid. 15-18.</note> with him againe, he giueth them plainely to vnderstand, that when they were so wel reared, and growne fat &amp; wel liking, then became they wanton &amp; stubborne against him: and gaue themselues to so grosse Idolatry, that so they seemed cleane to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get him, and to cast the memory of him, and of all his benefits towardes them, in vile contempt, euen at their heeles. In denouncing his iudgements against them, we finde in the ende, that neuerthelesse he willeth other Nations to haue that people of his in speciall regard: so that belike he doth not otherwise finde how to demaund <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> iudgement against them; but that hee findeth much mercy mingled withall to those that are his. So it shall be good first to consider in what sort hee denounceth those iudgements against them: and then may we the better see, on what ground it is, and how far-forth it is required, that other Nations should make such a reckoning of that his people. In what sort he denounceth those iudgements against them, wee can no sooner endeuour to finde, but that we espy withall, that indeed he mingleth great mercy with them: and so are first to consider of those his iudgementes: then, of such mercies as wee finde to bee mingled there-with. The consideration of those his iudgements yeeldeth vnto vs two principall branches: one, whence they doe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede; the other, what they are in themselues. As touching the former, they are shewed to come, of a resolute and determinate purpose of God. As touching the <note place="margin">Ibid. 19, 20. IbiI. 21, 22.</note> latter, they are of two sorts: one, that as they prouoked him with those that were no Gods, so would he prouoke them with those that were no people, and such a people too, as in whom there was no likelihood at all, euer to put them in hazzard of that their Dignity; the other, that both at home and abroad their estate should bee very heauy, euen of all the sort of them. The mercies that wee finde to bee mingled with these his iudgements, are of two sorts: first, that he dealeth not so hardly with <note place="margin">Ibid. 23-25.</note> them, as, but in some respect, hee otherwise would; then, that at length hee taketh part with them also, against their Enemies. In that hee dealeth not so hardly with them, as, but in some respect, he otherwise would, wee haue deliuered vnto vs, what it is that otherwise he would haue doone vnto them: and what reason hee had, both of that his forbearing of them; and that other-wise so hee might, and would haue dealt with them. That which otherwise he would haue done vnto them, was, euen <note place="margin">Ibid. 26.</note> to haue scattered them abroad, and vtterly to haue abolished, from the face of the Earth, the memory of them. The reason why hee did forbeare them therein, was, <note place="margin">Ibid 27.</note> least theit enemies should waxe proud thereat, and not to impute the same to the Lord, but to their owne power against them. The reason that otherwise he might <note place="margin">Ibid. 28-35.</note> and would haue dealt so with them, was, that they were so foolish and euill (which also was a speciall hinderance vnto them in the meane season:) and that the Lorde
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:7530:110"/> had vndoubted experience of it. That neuerthelsse at length (when he hath, to his good pleasure, humbled his people) he taketh part with them against their enemies, <note place="margin">Ibid. 36. 42.</note> that also is very plainly set downe: to the iust terror of those that at any time become enemies to the people of God; and to the singular comfort of those that are his. <note place="margin">Ibid. 43.</note> Out of which that warning in the end doth fitly arise, to all Nations besides, to make <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> speciall reckoning of the people of God: for that hee auengeth the blood of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, and is exceeding mercifull to them and their land; but of fearefull vengeance to all their aduersaries. Which Song when <hi>Moses</hi> had recited in the hearing of the <note place="margin">Ibid. 44, 45.</note> people, and in the presence of <hi>Iosuah,</hi> who now soone after was to succeede <hi>Moses</hi> in the gouernment of them, he farther willed them to haue a speciall regard thereunto, <note place="margin">Ibid. 46.</note> and not onely to motion it, but euen to commaund it vnto their Children: assuring them, that it was no matter so little concerning them, as that they needed not much <note place="margin">Ibid. 47.</note> to regard it; but that it was to great and singular good vse vnto them.</p>
            <p n="8">8 How <hi>Moses</hi> finished his course among them being now to be seene, wee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> are to note; first, how he was called vpon about it: then, how he also did readily ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresse himselfe vnto it. He was called vpon about it, the selfe-same day, as it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, wherein hee recited that Song vnto them: being then directed whither to go, <note place="margin">Ibid. 48. Ibid. 49, 50. Ibid. 51, 52.</note> to behold the Land, and to finish his life; and being then told againe, what the cause was, why hee should not enter with the rest into it. Hee readily addressed himselfe vnto it; first, by doing some thinges beneath before he ascended: then, by ascending thither vnto it, as he was prescribed. The things that first he did heere beneath, were two: one, that he blessed the Tribes of <hi>Israell;</hi> the other, that he laid his handes on <hi>Ioshuah.</hi> In that his blessing of the Tribes of <hi>Israell,</hi> it shall bee good for vs also more specially to marke, some thinges that belong vnto them all▪ and some, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to certaine of them. For those that belong vnto all, doe for many of them shew what estate wee also are like to haue vnder the gouernment and protection of God: such being (for that point) the Communion of Saintes, that what interest the people of God haue at any time had in the Lorde before, the same may any of the people of God looke to haue in him still, both nowe and euer, while the World en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dureth. And whereas, some of them there were, whose dignitie and function is yet (in diuers good &amp; great respects) in force, it shall be good, that out of them also we gather, what we shal find to giue any needful Lessons to vs. Omitting therefore such things as are peculiar to thē, and casting our eyes but vnto such as doe more specially concern vs also, &amp; so first beginning with those that did concerne thē al, we find some things thereunto appertaining (as it were) in the Praeface, or in the beginning of that his blessing: and some again, in the conclusion or ending of it. In the Praeface or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning <note place="margin">Deut. 33: 1-5.</note> of it, he puts thē in mind how graciously the lord did vouchsafe to impart his cōfortable presence among thē more and more, euer since they came out of <hi>Egypt</hi> to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> that present: as also it hath pleased him, since he set in hand with our deliuerance, out of that <hi>Aegyptiacall</hi> bondage, that of late the Church was in, euer more &amp; more to cleere vp his gracious countenance towards vs; and still to bestow new benefites on vs. Towardes the end he assureth them, that being (as they were) vnder Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, <note place="margin">Ibid. 26-29.</note> they were the happyest people vnder the Sunne; safe, and victorious against their Enemies, and notably furnished with earthly blessings: a very good and sound prouocation to all to come in, that yet stand out or hang off from the profession of the Gospell; seeing what benefites they may assure themselues to obtaine, if true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they can ioyne with their Bretheren therein. Those that belong to certaine of them, are those that wee finde in <hi>Iudah</hi> and <hi>Leuie; Iudah</hi> hauing the Scepter and Kingdome vnto it, cheefely before allotted, and <hi>Leuie</hi> the Priest-hoode: mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of great and speciall moment at all times else; and so, by that reason, with vs likewise. As touching <hi>Iudah,</hi> we are to note, what two thinges in him are coupled together: one, that praier is made for him; the other, that neuertheles there is great hope of safetie and victorie to him ascribed. In the Praier it is desired, that God <note place="margin">Ibid. 7.</note> would both heare him when he calleth vpon him: and (belike when he hath to deale with the Enemy) bring him home safe to his people againe. The hope of safety
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:7530:110"/> and victory to him ascribed (as the original it self doth giue it) resteth in two principal <note place="margin">

But these two doe well agree together. And so with vs, although it be certaine, that such as are of the Kingdome of Christ, both themselues doe striue, and haue a sure helpe in the Lorde (for there are neuer want, that would straighten the boundes of his Kingdome:) yet is it needefull euer to ioyne Prayer withall, both that God would euer heare them; and euer bring them safe to theyr people againe. For <hi>Leuie,</hi> it seemeth, he is altogether in Prayer: but first, onely for such thinges as doe more specially belong to his function: then, for such as are for his maintenance and function withall. As touching such thinges as do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> more spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially belong to his function, wee are to consider, what it is that on that behalfe hee dooth desire: and what reasons they are whereon hee pleadeth. The thinges for <note place="margin">Ibid. 8.</note> which he prayeth are, that integrity of life, and knowledge of Doctrine, may euer be with him. The reasons whereon he pleadeth, are eyther of <hi>Aaron</hi> the chiefest <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> of them: or else of the <hi>Leuites</hi> themselues. Of <hi>Aaron,</hi> for that God had sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <note place="margin">Ibid. 8.</note> him vnto it: and for that hee was so mooued with the vntowardnesse of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that then he brake the boundes of patience thereby. Of the <hi>Leuites,</hi> for that <note place="margin">Ibid. 9, 10.</note> they had before done that speciall seruice to God (nothing at all therein respecting their Kinsfolke or Friendes:) and for that they were to teach his people, and euer to Minister before the Lord. As touching such as were for their maintenance, &amp; function withall: first, he desireth, that God would both blesse his substance, &amp; accept of the <note place="margin">Ibid. 11.</note> work of his hands: then, whereas euer he should haue Enemies to both (both to his maintenance, &amp; to his Ministery) it would please God, to smite thorough the loynes <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> of such as should rise vp against him, and of so many as did hate him, and that in such sort, that they neuer might haue eyther heart or power to rise vp againe. Wherein if we come to our Ministery also, there is no question, but that on all handes it were to be wished, that holinesse in life, and knowledge in doctrine might euer goe with it: if integrity of life, good trayning vp before, and good choyce after, may not be omitted; if some speciall learning withall, the reward of learning should not bee so curtold, as now it is. If none be meete for it, but such as can so far remoue from them all priuate respect, they are not those ordinary gallants, that will serue to such pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose: no nor so much as to take any paines to teach the people, or to attend theyr Ministery before the Lord. And no question at all, but that God needeth to blesse their substance, and to accept the worke of their handes, when as so commonly, euen among those that professe the Gospell, they are so fleesed in the one, and put to such disgrace in the other, as daily they are: as also there is no question, but that vnlesse God do mightily beat downe indeed such as are so grieuous vnto them, it is not likely, that euer they would find (so long as there were any power in thē) but that still they might make as bold with it, as yet they doe. That <hi>Moses</hi> laid his handes on <hi>Ioshuah,</hi> though we haue not the originall Story heere; yet haue we a plaine rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it: and thereby it appeareth, that as God had willed <hi>Moses</hi> so to doe, and as <note place="margin">Deut. 34: 9. Nu. 27: 18-23</note> it is recorded there that so he did, so it may seeme (as being the fittest, and most like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) that now is the time that it was done, for that <hi>Moses</hi> was now to part with the gouernment cleane, and <hi>Iosuah</hi> to succeede him therein. So <hi>Moses</hi> tooke <hi>Iosuah,</hi> set him before <hi>Eleazar</hi> the Priest, and before the Congregation, laid his handes on <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> him so to commend him to God and to the people, &amp; to inuest him in that his office, and than gaue him charge what hee was to doe. The which as it did come from God, it sheweth, that the care of succession is also of him: and as <hi>Moses</hi> readilie yeelded to put him in place, so should that bee, in such like case, grieuous to none. These thinges when he had done beneath, then, according as hee was directed, hee <note place="margin">Deut. 34: 1-7</note> went vp to the Lord, who there did shew him the Land that the people were to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy; but told him againe, that himselfe should not go with them into it: and so <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> died and was buryed there, at the age of 120. yeares; but the place of his buriall vnknowne to them all. A sufficient token, that God had no such liking, as many of vs haue since conceiued, that it was so acceptable a thing vnto him, to haue such relickes of the bodies or cloathes of the Saints departed.</p>

Those that we speake of, are but few of them knowne by name: but by these fewe it may probably seeme, that there were many moe besides. Those fewe that are knowne by name, are <hi>Iob</hi> himselfe, and the chiefe of those others of whom his Story maketh mention, <hi>Elephaz, Bildad, Zophar,</hi> and <hi>Elihu:</hi> all Gentiles, and none of that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that it pleased God to make his peculiar people; but yet the most of them, it seemeth, descended of <hi>Abraham,</hi> or of such as were neere vnto him.

As for <hi>Iob</hi> himselfe, and <hi>Zophar</hi> one of his Friendes, we haue not so great probability for them, whence they should be in particular: but, because <hi>Iob</hi> himselfe is saide to be the greatest of all the Men of the East, whither <hi>Abraham</hi> sent his other Sonnes to inhabit, and seeing he could not be farre from his friendes, nor his friends from him, seeing also, that the Countrey where he dwelt, might take the name of the first Sonne of <hi>Aram</hi> of the selfe-same Name, and <hi>Aram</hi> himselfe inhabited <hi>Syria,</hi> and gaue Name vnto it, therefore is there good probability that hee was of those <note place="margin">Gen. 10: 23.</note> Countries, and like enough to haue beene eyther of the line of <hi>Aram</hi> and <hi>Ʋz</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, or else of <hi>Abraham</hi> by <hi>Keturah</hi> after. <hi>Zophar</hi> also could not be but in those <note place="margin">Ibid. 2: 11.</note> partes too, because he was of the more speciall friendes of <hi>Iob,</hi> and agreed with the others to come and visite him in that his distresse.</p>
            <p n="2">2 The story of those is of two principall matters: one, that is commonly no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> by all; another, that is noted I thinke but by fewe, as the worthynesse thereof would require. That which is commonly noted by all, is, what a tryall it pleased God to make of <hi>Iob.</hi> That which is so little noted by others, is, what knowledge of God and what speciall regard to his glory, there was then found euen among those that were none of that peculiar people which God had chosen. But the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of these is so mingled with the former, that wee cannot in any wise gather the one, but that we must deale with the other also. In the tryall therefore that it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed God to make of <hi>Iob,</hi> we are first to consider, how low it pleased God to bring him: then, how be raysed him vp againe. To find out how low it pleased God to bring him, wee are first to note, in what estate hee was at that time when God did make this tryal of him: then, how farre vnder the same hee brought him. The e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state wherein he was when God made this tryal of him was very good: first in such things as are plainely set downe; then, in some others that were implyed. It is
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:7530:111"/> plainly set downe that his estate was good: both towards God; and the world also. Towards God, hee was, first for his owne person vpright or iust; so that both hee <note place="margin">Iob. 1: 1.</note>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> feared God, and eschewed euill: then, so carefull of the wayes of his children like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, <note place="margin">Ibid. 5.</note> least they by offence some of theirs in their feasting should prouoke the wrath of god, that euer in such case he sanctifyed them, &amp; offered burnt offerings for eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of them. Towards the world he was likewise in especiall good estate, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in his substance: but also, in his children. His substance was noted to bee, seuen <note place="margin">Ibid. 3.</note> thousand sheepe, three thousand Camels, fiue hundred yoake of Oxen, and fiue hundred she-asses: and his familie so great, that he was the greatest of all men of the East. His children were not only a comfortable sort for the number of them, being seauen Sons and three daughters: but hauing the world so much <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t their <note place="margin">Ibid. 2. Ibid. 4.</note> wils, and being at such concord and loue among themselues, that they vsually fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted together by course, one after another. Those others that are but implyed, are of his wife and friends: his wife belike being comfortable before in his prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, who soone after grew so farre out of temper in his aduersity; and his friends, <note place="margin">Ibid. 2: 9. Ibid. 11.</note> by gathering themselues together to comfort him then, sufficiently thereby decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, that indeed they were friendly, or bare him good will. But though these be but implyed here; yet is there great probabilitie of both, by the most vsual course among vs: men hauing such comfort of their wiues, as for the most part men haue; and the greater sort (such as <hi>Iob</hi> was yet) euer lightly hauing friends ynow. And for the latter of them, <hi>Iob</hi> himselfe doth afterward sufficiently declare, that hee was <note place="margin">Ibi. 29: 21-24</note> in that rekoning with the people about him, that needes hee must bee very well friended.</p>
            <p n="3">3 So was <hi>Iob</hi> now in so speciall good estate, that when it pleased God to bring <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> him downe (especially so farre as he did) he had then the greater fall: and therein are we first to consider vpon what occasion he did it; then, how far it pleased God thereon to do it. The occasion was, that Sathan mooued the Lord twice against <note place="margin">Ibid. 1: 6-12 2: 1-6.</note> him: once, for all but his person onely; then after, to seize on his person also. Out of which we may assure our selues, both that Sathan is euer busie inough against vs and yet that he can doe nothing at all, but so farre as it pleaseth God to allow him. It pleased God thereon to doe it, in great measure: first giuing Sathan full libertie in those things that hee desired; then, adding farther vexation besides. For those things that Sathan desired, hee gaue him great liberty: but with speciall charge, to proceed no farther. But therein we are not onely to see, what was done ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon: but also, in what sort <hi>Iob</hi> did take it. That which was done, thereuppn, was <note place="margin">Ibid. 1: 13-19.</note>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> that presently <hi>Iob</hi> was bereft of all his cattell great and small, and of his seruaunts that did attend them, and of all his children; and that in strange and fearefull ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: <note place="margin">Ibid 2: 7, 8.</note> then also, that on his owne bodie was cast very great anguish and paine, and he left with a very poore and miserable helpe to himselfe. As the former of which <note place="margin">Ibid. 1: 20, 21</note> though then he gaue himselfe, not onely to inward, but euen to outward, and to actuall lamentation; yet both his owne words did well inough witnesse, that hee quietly tooke it: and the Text it selfe doth giue him that testimonie also. In the latter of them, we doe not finde, that he complained any more of this, and beeing <note place="margin">Ibid. 22.</note> destitute belike of others (abhorring the filthinesse that he thereby was in, and not able himselfe to vse the nayles of his owne fingers therein they being smitten as the rest of his body was) he quietly yeelded to that poore and miserable helpe that was <note place="margin">Ibid. 2: 8.</note> left him, with a potsheard or shell to helpe to ease himselfe of some of his paine in some of his botches or sores, and to rest himselfe on the earth or Ashes, whereunto <note place="margin">Ibid. 1: 20.</note> hee had betaken himselfe in the way of lamentation before.</p>
            <p n="4">4 That farther vexation that it pleased God to adde besides, was by his wife <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> and friendes: wherein wee are to consider, what it was; and in what sort himselfe did beare it. Of that which came by his Wife, the Story is short: but that of his Friendes occupyeth almost the rest of all the whole Story of <hi>Iob.</hi> That of his wife <note place="margin">Ibid. 2: 9.</note> was a naughty praeiudice in her, that her Husband had serued God in vaine, to bee
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:7530:112"/> thus requited by him: and that she made so bold with him, as, out of that prophane conceit of hers, bitterly to vpbraid him therewith. Which temptation no doubt was strong: especially, proceeding from one that was so neare vnto him, and so priuie to all his doings, that she aboue others might know the integrity of all his waies. And it may be that Sathan, hauing power of all besides his owne person, and leauing vnto him not one of his children to comfort him withall: as neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse he left him some of his seruants, to helpe to breake his heart by the strange and sorrowfull tidings that they should bring him; so to that end he left him his wife <note place="margin">Ibid. 11 15, 16, 17, 19.</note> also, to vpbraide him with that his rare integritie, in so bitter and spightfull maner, as now she did. Whereby also it may appeare, as before I noted, that by likely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood she was a louing and a comfortable wife vnto him before, because Sathan re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> her to his purpose now, as thereby the meeter instrument for this his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. This temptation, strong though it were yet notwithstanding did <hi>Iob</hi> beare maruellous well: as may appeare, both by his owne words againe; and by the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony that the Text it selfe doth giue him. <note place="margin">Ibid. 2: 10.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5 That farther vexation which came by his friendes, and occupieth so great <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> a part of the Story, was, that they also, on the like preiudice, did so much condemne him, that he had two great conflicts with them: first with those three that were, as it seemeth, of greatest reckoning; then, with a fourth, who was as it seemeth of lesser account, and so for a time but a stander-by. Yet may it seeme, that hee was strongest of them all in the businesse he tooke in hand: for that, as it seemeth, <hi>Iob</hi> did put all those others to silence; but by this fourth was put to silence himselfe. So was <hi>Iob</hi> soundly baited by these, two seuerall times: first by those three that spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially goe vnder the name of his friends; then, by the fourth, that did set vpon him a-fresh when they had done with him. To begin therefore with those three, we are first to consider of such things as are common to them all: and then to come to the seuerall Stories of euery of them. Common vnto them all it is, that they came as friends to comfort him, and for a time, were in great astonishment and sorrow for <note place="margin">Ibid. 11-13.</note> him: but afterward altering their mindes, they became heauie aduersaries vnto him. They came as friends to comfort him, on a setled perswasion of him, that he was a marueilous iust and Godly man. They became so heauy aduersaries vnto him, for that when they saw him so notably afflicted as he was, and cast downe so very low, they then conceiued, that they had beene fouly beguiled in him, and that he was but a notable hypocrite: else that it could not be, that God would euer haue laide his hand so strangely and so heauy vpon him.</p>
            <p n="6">6 To come to the seuerall Stories of euery of them, wee are to note, that none of them all contented themselues once to haue bent themselues against him; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> but for a time still renewed their forces vpon him: yet the first two of them, once more than the third. For each of those made three seuerall speeches against him: and he, but two. But they were all answered by <hi>Iob,</hi> euen euery of their speeches seuerally. So that the vexation that arose vnto <hi>Iob,</hi> from these, came not all at once, but in seuerall portions, and at seuerall times: and therefore are we more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly to marke, what vexation it was that out of euery of those speeches arose vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him; and in what sort his answeres may shew how he did beare it. Where wee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> are likewise to note, that none of them did vtter their speeches against <hi>Iob</hi> at once, but as it were successiuely, one after another: euery of them, when at one time hee had once spoken; yeelding the place vnto the others to say their mindes also. So that all three came vpon him, one after anorher, obseruing one and the selfe-same order, twice: at the thirde time, but two of them onely, the thirde of their company then falling of, and prosecuting the cause no farther. And the order that still they obserued, was, that <hi>Eliphaz</hi> began, <hi>Bildad</hi> followed, and <hi>Zophar</hi> kept the third place twice, but then, gaue ouer. When <hi>Eliphaz</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore first began, wee are to consider, what vexation in that his first speach arose vnto <hi>Iob:</hi> then in what sort <hi>Iob</hi> did beare it. But then that <hi>Eliphaz</hi> bee not farther char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:7530:112"/> than there was cause, we are likewise to marke what cause <hi>Iob</hi> gaue him thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to: then, how <hi>Eliphaz</hi> dealt with him thereon. The cause that <hi>Iob</hi> gaue him here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, was, that now indeede hee curssed the day of his birth, and vttered diuers im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient <note place="margin">Ibid 3: 1-26.</note> speeches of that kind: after that, besides those his losses before, his body al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so had now a sennight beene in such anguish. The vexation that out of the speech <note place="margin">Ibid. 2: 13.</note> of <hi>Eliphaz</hi> did heereupon arise vnto him, seemeth to be; first, that charging him to <note place="margin">Chapt. 4. &amp; 5.</note> bee of a base minde, in that hee tooke his affliction no more quietly; and so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending the Iustice of God, as if <hi>Iob</hi> had impeached the same: he so calleth <hi>Iob</hi> to repentance, as if there were no quaestion, but that how well soeuer they had thought of him, yet was he, no doubt, maruellous bad, that had so heauy a iudgement on him. Which so grieuous condemnation of his so closely giuen, <hi>Iob</hi> did not so qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly take, but that he standeth fast vnto it, that he had good cause so to poure forth <note place="margin">Chapt. 6. &amp; 7.</note> the anguish of his Soule as he did, and reprooueth his friendes that so vnkindly they faile him now: &amp; then renewing the complaint of his afflictions again, after a sort he chargeth God to deale hardlyer with him, than he hath giuen him strength to beare. Whereupon <hi>Bildad</hi> taking his turne next, chargeth him, ouer-much to lay In-iustice <note place="margin">Chapt 8.</note> to God: and so doth set forth the Iustice of God against Sinners, and his fauour to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards those that seeke him, that the secrecie of his conclusion sheweth it selfe to be, that <hi>Iob</hi> was not the man he seemed to be, but such as those strange and heauy iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments had now bewrayed. Which reproofe of his <hi>Iob</hi> so taketh, that although he <note place="margin">Chapt. 9.</note> plainely acknowledge the great Iustice, Wisedome, and power of God; yet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to his owne afflictions, he still bindeth much now and then on this, that his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertes were not such, as those his afflictions might seeme to import: and then retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the bitter sence of his afflictions againe, hee pittifully, and impatiently too, <note place="margin">Chapt. 10. Chapt. 11.</note>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> bemoaneth the same to God himselfe. Whereupon the turne beeing come to <hi>Zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phar,</hi> he plainely chargeth <hi>Iob,</hi> so to iustify himselfe before God, that no man might abide to heare him; and then plainely telling him, that those his afflictions were but for his sinnes; and as in respect of Gods iustice he suffereth him not to looke for any other so long as he abideth in sinne; so neuerthelesse he assureth him of fauour, if he can repent and turne vnto him. By which speech of his, <hi>Iob</hi> finding now by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that they all were feathered of one wing, all condemning him for so great an offender (and withall for so close an Hypocrite) as those his great and strange afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions <note place="margin">Ibid. 12, 13: 1-16. Ibi. 13▪ 17-28, and 14.</note> did seeme to import, is much netled there-with, and reiecteth them now, as ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry partiall against him: and then, turning to God, he so pleadeth his cause with him, in that his perturbation and griefe of minde, on his afflictions, and their praeiudice, as that though he speake many things well; yet diuers such thinges doe slip him withal, as out of which he might easily be very hardly censured.</p>
            <p n="7">7 Hauing thus baited him once, yet once more they all set on him againe, in the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> same order they held before. <hi>Eliphaz</hi> therefore taking his place first againe, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <note place="margin">Ibid. 15.</note> as he had occasion giuen him by the last speech of <hi>Iob,</hi> as in the way of answer to <hi>Zophar;</hi> so hee did accordingly take it: and now more plainely condemning him than before, doth so lay before him the iudgements of God against Sinners, as plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sheweth, that in his iudgement, <hi>Iob</hi> was there to take vp his place, and no where else. Heereunto <hi>Iob</hi> graunteth, that indeede the Lorde hath smitten him, and <note place="margin">Ibid. 16, 17.</note> that so sore, that he maketh no other account, but therein to finish those his misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble dayes: but still he rebuketh those his friendes, and chargeth them with an vnkind and vniust preiudice of him; and shunneth not therein to come to his tryall with God, but plainely professeth, that hee earnestly wisheth the same. <hi>Bildad</hi> then ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king <note place="margin">Ibid. 18.</note> the second place againe, againe reprooueth <hi>Iob</hi> roundly for that great presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that hee conceiued to bee in him; and very well discourseth of the miserable estate of the wicked, but yet still on their aforesaid supposall, that that must bee the <note place="margin">Ibi. 19: 1-4.</note> case of <hi>Iob.</hi> But <hi>Iob</hi> againe reprooueth him, and the others withall, for that theyr bad praeiudice of him, and for those bitter reproaches which out of that praeiudice of theirs, they did so plentifully poure foorth vppon him: and then comming to the truth of the cause, there againe, not onely he acknowledgeth that the hand of God <note place="margin">Ibid. 5-22.</note>
               <pb n="200" facs="tcp:7530:113"/> was heauy vppon him, but himselfe at large describeth the same; but therewithall, <note place="margin">Ibid. 23-27. Ibid. 28, 29.</note> both declareth, that he hath good confidence yet, and warneth them (if needs they will so peremptorily condemne all the wicked vnto the Sword) to take heed to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Neuerthelesse these thinges so little preuaile with them, that <hi>Zophar,</hi> whose turne came now againe, was so farre from slipping it yet, that hee seemeth rather to hasten vnto it, as himselfe also granteth. Where first he taketh it in ill part, that <hi>Iob</hi> returneth his praeiudice backe to him and his fellowes, and dooth not yeeld himselfe to haue beene so bad a man, and so deepe an hypocryte, as he and the others had <note place="margin">Ibid. 20: 1-3</note> now lately conceiued him to haue beene: then comming vnto the matter againe, hee sheweth, that euer it hath beene the manner of God, in all their wayes to <note place="margin">Ibid. 4-29,</note> afflict, and in the end quite to roote out all the wicked themselues and their vngra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious posterity; not putting him in hope of mercy now as he did before, but alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether vrging the hard estate of the wicked vnto him, as the onely company whereunto he had in truth to sort himselfe. Whereunto <hi>Iob</hi> replying, both in the beginning and in the end of this his speech, reprooueth those his friends for such <note place="margin">Ibid. 21: 1-3, 34. Ibid 4.</note> their dealing with him, insteed of comfort giuing vnto him such plenty of Gall. and as touching the cause they haue in hand, first acknowledging, that if hee had no farther comfort, but so farre as he could cleere himselfe in the iudgement of men, he had but a loose handfast of it indeed: then he declareth, both that the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked flourish for a time, but haue in the end an heauy iudgment; and that himselfe <note place="margin">Ibid. 5-33. Ibi. 16, 27, 28</note> hath nothing to doe with them; and that they doe him great wrong to sort him vnto them.</p>
            <p n="8">8 Being thus baited twice by them all, he cannot so rest, but is set on againe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> by a couple of them. Where first <hi>Eliphaz,</hi> taking him in hand againe, maketh (as it seemeth to me) but a scorne, that <hi>Iob</hi> should account himselfe to stand so cleere, and not as they conceiued him to doe; and then plainely chargeth him (yet <note place="margin">Ibid. 22: 1-4.</note> belike not that himselfe knew any such thing by him particular, but because he was become so mighty before, and the hand of God was now so sore vpon him) that he <note place="margin">Ibid. 5: 20.</note> had beene an hard man and iniurious to many, yea and prophane to God himselfe: <note place="margin">Ibid. 21-30. Ibi. 23: 1-12.</note> but withall exhorteth him vnto repentance, and so assureth him to be restored and set vp againe. Whereupon <hi>Iob,</hi> seeing his friends cannot, or will not bee other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise perswaded of him, holdeth himselfe contented for them, but then appealeth vnto God; and yet there also maketh no question, but that in his vnsearchable wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome he hath his owne iust designes, which also he wil not faile to execute as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe <note place="margin">Ibid <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Then <note place="margin">b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

But that which he saith, is of that conceiued opinion, that <hi>Iob</hi> accounted himselfe cleere before God: which now he sheweth, was so grosse a <note place="margin">Ibid. 25.</note> thing in it selfe, that looking but little vnto the great maiestie of God, both in it selfe and by comparison of other excellent creatures, he might easily finde himselfe to be farre out of the way. Vnto this <hi>Iob</hi> doth giue him a short answere: but when he seeth that none of them all replyeth againe, then himselfe proceedeth. In his answere vnto him, he will not take that speech of <hi>Bildads,</hi> as if hee reprooued him as iustifying himselfe before God (which notwithstanding was <hi>Bildads</hi> mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning) <note place="margin">Ibid. 26: 1-4.</note> but as if his meaning was to helpe God, and obiecteth it, as it seemeth, in the way of a scorne vnto him: and cleereth himselfe, not to haue had it in his purpose <note place="margin">Ibid. 5-14.</note> any way to impeach the glory of God, by a farther declaring and acknowledging his wisedome and power in all his works. Himselfe proceeding hath two other speeches: in the former of which, he yet presseth those his friends somewhat far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but in the latter he doth but bemone his present estate. In that wherein hee presseth his friendes yet somewhat farther, hee so defendeth his owne innocency <note place="margin">Ibid, 27. 1-7</note> now, and that God hath some other meaning in sending those afflictions vnto
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:7530:113"/> him, that he chargeth them to be bad men in hauing and holding that preiudice of him: and then, both he sheweth, at large what will be the portion of such (and that belike to teach them to be better aduised); and sheweth, that the wisedome and <note place="margin">Ibid. 8-23.</note> waies of God are vnsearchable or past finding out (and that in like sort, it seemeth <note place="margin">Ibid. 18: 1-28</note> to helpe to perswade them, that in the meaning of those his afflictions, they might easily be so wide as they were.)

In that it pleased God now to authorise him to that function, we are likewise to note; first, that he doth it: then, in what manner he doth it. In that he doth it, we are (to our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort) to marke, that hee dooth not so soone take away one, but that readily hee gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth another. <hi>Moses</hi> was no sooner gone, but that the Lord then turned to <hi>Iosu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah,</hi>

As Christ dehorted the people of his time, to bee so carking for the thinges of this life, giuing them to vnderstand, that their heauenly Father knew well enough, that they stood in neede of them: so, no doubt, hee knoweth as well, that wee shall then neede a Leader also; and so our trust is, that hee prouideth accordingly for vs. If wee in the meane season can serue him, and depend on his good prouidence for that matter; and when the time shall come, readily yeelde our selues vnto such as it shall please him to appoint: there is good hope, that hee will continue the selfe-same his goodnesse towardes vs, by that other Instrument, that all this while he hath done by this. But he that was appointed now, was at least a voluntary attendant if not in a manner, euen a Seruant to him that was in place before: and that was like enough <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> to be, no small heart-burning to many of the Heads-men among them.

And then, as euery one in that might see, that in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of those troubles before, it was to good purpose so setled then, notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the hardnesse that it also brought with it: so not vnlikely, but that the wiser sort will then also see, that in respect of those euils that were otherwise like to ensue, it will be cleerely the best to yeelde vnto such as God shall send vs, notwithstanding that euen they also are like enough to bring somewhat with them that may go much against our stomackes, if they be not the better moderated before. In what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner it pleased God then to call <hi>Iosuah</hi> vnto that function of his, wee finde set forth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> vnto vs in two principall pointes: one, a comfortable and gracious encouraging of him; the other, that he did direct him and teach him, what to doe. In his encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging of him, we are first to see, what it is: and then to note certaine other thinges besides. The encouragment that he giueth him, is not onely that hee biddeth him <note place="margin">Ios. 1: 3-6, 7▪ <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Those other thinges besides that we may there note, are first such as lie reasonable plaine: then, one other, that it may bee, would not otherwise be so easily noted. Those that are reasonable plaine, are, first, <note place="margin">Ios. 1: 9</note> that wishing him to be of good courage, it doth plainely declare, that such as are in authority, had euer neede to bee of good courage: and telling him withall, that hee <note place="margin">Ibid. 5: 9.</note> will be with him, it doth teach when his courage must be, and pointeth to the onelie Fountaine of all other good valour besides. That other, which it may be, woulde not otherwise be so easily noted, is, that commending vnto him, in all thinges to do <note place="margin">Ibid. 7.</note> according to the Law, hee therein requireth againe, that hee bee of good courage: which giueth vs plainely to vnderstand, as experience also continually teacheth, that euen such as are in authority, and haue the power of Earth in their handes, yet often they feare to doe as the word of God requireth of them, vnlesse they bee endewed with some speciall valour. He directeth and teacheth him what to doe, both for his first entring into the Land: and what course to take euer after, in the place where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto now he was called. As touching his entry at the first, hee did giue plaine li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty <note place="margin">Ibid. 2.</note> now, to himselfe, and to all the people to enter in. The course that he should afterward keepe, in respect of the place whereunto now he was called, hee doth not onely giue him in charge: but sheweth him good reason withall, why hee should haue regard vnto it. The course it selfe was, diligently to study the Lawe of God <note place="margin">Ibid. 7, 8.</note> all the dayes of his life, and to meditate therein day and night: that hee neuer turned aside, neyther to the right hand, nor to the left; but that still he obserued and did, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to all that is written therein. A maruellous good, and a needefull course, for all Christian Princes and Gouernours: and not to bee so abandoned from them, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> as with many of them it is. The reason why <hi>Iosuah</hi> should haue good regard vnto it, was, that so hee should prosper and haue good successe in all his affaires whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer. A very good motiue, especially to such, as with whom respect of duty little prauaileth.</p>
            <p n="2">2 To find out in what sort <hi>Iosuah,</hi> being called to this charge, did set in hand with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> it, it appeareth that some part of the Story thereof doth appertaine to the East-side
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:7530:115"/> of Iordan, where yet they were: but most part of it vnto the other. On the East side of Iordan where they were yet, we haue two places of their aboade, and, when we see what is done in either of them, then see we all hereunto appertaining. The former of them was the Plaine of <hi>Moab,</hi> or <hi>Sethim,</hi> because that Plaine was neere vnto <hi>Sethim,</hi> their two and fortieth or last Station, where <hi>Moses</hi> dyed, and where <note place="margin">Num. 31: 49. Ios. 2: 1. Ios. 3: 1.</note> the Lord (immediately after) appointed <hi>Iosuah</hi> to succeede: the other was neare to Iordan-side, and is not otherwise named than so. In the former of these we finde they abode a while after: and then remoued to the other. They aboade here till some what after the spies that were sent returned againe: so first of the sending of those spies; then, that which was done here immediately after. In the sending of those spies, first what time they were sent: then, what may be thought of <hi>Iosuahs</hi> doing therein. What time they were sent, is therefore to be more specially mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, because the order of the text might seeme otherwise to import: first speaking of the warning giuen to the people to get themselues ready, after three daies to <note place="margin">Ios. 1: 10, 11. Ios. 2. 1. Ibid. Ibid. 16. 22.</note> passe ouer Iordan; and afterward speaking of sending the spies. But the text is plaine they were sent from <hi>Sethim:</hi> and those three daies that they were faine to hide themselues in the mountaines as they returned, together with the time of their going thether and comming home againe, doe sufficiently shew, that they must haue a longer time to that their businesse, than those three dayes of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples warning were able to yeeld. And if needs he would send in any spies at all, it is most likely, both that he would send them, and that they returned againe, before he gaue the people that warning for their entring so soone: this being his resolution, and the other, the ground-worke whence it proceeded. What may bee thought of <hi>Iosuahs</hi> doing therein, though most men make no question of it, and some ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> it fully approued: yet seemeth it to me, to bee very doubtfull.

But that in this case there may be doubt of infirmitie also, there may be some things that may seeme to imply: and such others as may seeme to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue it, may neuerthelesse be otherwise taken. Those that seeme to imply it doe some of them goe before: and some follow. Those that goe before, are two: one, that great displeasure of God for sending in spialls before, and the inconueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence that came therof, the people being vtterly discouraged by the most of them &amp; <note place="margin">Num. 13: 2-14: 38.</note> for their disobedience then (for a long time) excluded; the other, that great assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, that a little before God himselfe had giuen him for that matter. Those which followed, were in the successe that those spies had, first being faine, by the <note place="margin">Ios. 1: 2-9.</note> danger that so they fell into, both themselues to make promise (and, after a sort, to <note place="margin">Ios. 2▪14 Ibid. 6: 22-25</note> make <hi>Iosuah</hi> and all the people lyable therevnto) to spare certaine of those whom God often before (for their good) had specially aduised thē to destroy: then that, the spies themselues were so ferretted and pursued, that they could bring with them no <note place="margin">Exod. 23: 32 33. 34: 12-16 Nu. 33: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

That it is no where by name misliked, so are there many others besides: being sufficient, if they be condemned generally. That God vouchsafed <hi>Rahab</hi> that dignitie, there may be diuers good reasons of his doing therin: &amp; yet the fact alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether vnwaranted to them.

That which was done here immediately after the returne of these spies, was partly concerning all the people: and partly concerning certaine of them. Concerning the whole people it was, that <hi>Iosuah</hi> caused proclamation to be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
               <note place="margin">Ios. 1: 10, 11.</note> made throughout the host, to prepare them vitals: and to let them vnderstand

Those o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that were not the whole people but certaine of them, were the two Tribes and an halfe, that by couenant before were bound to goe armed before their brethren: and not to leaue them till they had subdude their enemies on the <note place="margin">Nu. 32: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

These doth <hi>Iosuah</hi> put in minde <note place="margin">Ios. 1: 12-15</note> of that their promise: and now requireth the performance of it. Who answere a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine maruellous well, not only that they will do so much as they promised; but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, <note place="margin">Ibid. 16-18.</note> that they would be obedient and ready in all things else, as much at his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement now, as they were at the cōmandement of <hi>Moses</hi> before, yeelding also no lesse punishment then death it selfe to those that would not: and desire likewise, at the hands of God, that he would vouchsafe to be with him now, as he was with <hi>Moses</hi> before: and of himselfe, that he would be strong, &amp; of a good courage. This being done there, then <hi>Iosuah</hi> getteth vp early (ere those three daies before mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <note place="margin">Ios. 3: 1.

That which was the Lords doing, was, that now when <hi>Iosuah</hi> had entred so farre alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die (so farre, as it were proouing what hee would doe of himselfe) then hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth in with speciall comfort, giuing him to vnderstand, that he would beginne <note place="margin">Ibid. 7.</note> that day to magnifie him before all <hi>Israel,</hi> that they might see, that as hee was with <hi>Moses</hi> before, so would he be with him also now: and so willeth him to charge the <note place="margin">Ibid. 8.</note> Priests, when they come vnto <hi>Iordan,</hi> not to feare to enter into it; yea, and in the bottome of it to make their stand. Vnto that part of the Story that belongeth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the other side whither now they are going, we may account to appertaine, first their passage thither: then, such things as were done there. As touching their passage thither, we are first to see the manner of it: then, how the people of the land were touched with it. As for the manner of it; the people are already war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to take their direction from the Arke, when to set forward, and how to follow: the Priests likewise that bare the Arke, are willed already to take it vp, and to bee going; and the text doth beare them witnesse, that so they did. Now therefore the Priests that bare the Arke, are set forward: and the rest of the people haue set themselues in order, euery one in their place to follow after, and as it seemeth, are somewhat entred into their way alreadie. And the Priests comming to <hi>Iordan</hi> while yet the people were as it seemeth but in their way thitherward, in such like distance as to them was appointed; <hi>Iosuah</hi> giueth the people to vnderstand, that by that mighty worke of God at that time, in giuing them passage on drie ground <note place="margin">Ios. 3: 9-11.</note> thorough that great riuer, they might bee assured, that the Lord would cast out their enemies before them: and therefore willed them, out of euery Tribe to make a man, to take vp euery of them one great stone, to pitch or set vp in the midst of <note place="margin">Ibid▪ 12: 13.</note> the channell when they came there, for a memoriall of their passage ouer in that
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:7530:116"/> place, on dry Land. The Priestes therefore that bare the Arke, entering into the <note place="margin">Ibid. 14-17.</note> Riuer (which, at that time of the yeare, was wont to bee greatest, and to fill all his bankes) the Waters presently gaue them place: those that were on their right hand aboue them, drawing backe and standing on an heape; and those that were on their left hand beneath them, hasting away from them a-pace. So the Priests come to the Channell, and there make their stand till all the people had passed ouer. At which time, though it be not declared in what manner they passed ouer: yet because <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>

                  </gap>: 4, 8, 13 Ibid. 9, 13.</note> the seauen Priestes that blew the Trumpets, were to go immediatly before the Arke, and the forty thousand Armed, of those two Tribes &amp; an halfe, were to go before the rest of the people, therefore it seemeth, that the Priestes that bare the Arke hauing taken their stand, then those that blewe the Trumpets followed next, and first went ouer; then those forty thousandes armed, and lastly all the rest of the people, euery sort of them in such order as before was to them appointed. In which time of theyr passage, it seemeth, that those twelue men that were appointed to bring with them from the East-side of <hi>Iordan,</hi> euery of them one stone to pitch vp in the bottome of <hi>Iordan,</hi> were nowe occupied in pitching them vp there. And <hi>Iosuah</hi> againe, as by <note place="margin">Ios. 4: 9.</note> the Lord hee was directed, caused other twelue men (of euery Tribe, one) to take <note place="margin">Ibid. 1-8.</note> twelue stones out of the Channell, and to carrie them with them to the place where they should encamp or lodge that night to be set vp there: which beeing taken out, then <hi>Iosuah,</hi> as in this also he was directed, caused or gaue leaue to the Priestes that <note place="margin">Ibid 14-17.</note> bare the Arke, to come forth out of the Channell. Who also were no sooner come vp out of the course of the Water, but that the Waters flowed againe, and fell into <note place="margin">Ibid 18.</note> their wonted course. Which passage of theirs was on the tenth day of their first month much agreeing to our March, and so but Spring-time with vs, though Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uest <note place="margin">Ibid. 19.</note> with them: the distance and site of these diuers Countries ordinarily yeelding such variety in those matters. On which day likewise comming to <hi>Gilgal,</hi> to encamp <note place="margin">Ibid. 19.</note> or lodge there, then, as it seemeth towardes the Euening, did <hi>Iosuah</hi> cause those twelue stones that they tooke out of <hi>Iordan,</hi> to be pitched vp there: and taught the <note place="margin">Ibid. 20-24.</note> people then praesent, how to deliuer the Story of them, and the cause of their setting vp there, vnto their posterity ensuing. How the people of the Land were touched with it, to the end we may the better finde, it shall be good not onely to marke what the Tent saith thereof: but withall to note, that one other thing there might in such case be expected, of which notwithstanding we haue heere no mention at all. The Text it selfe saith, that all the Kinges, West of <hi>Iordan,</hi> were vtterly dismaide and out <note place="margin">Ios. 5: 1.</note> of heart, at this strange enterance of the people of <hi>Israell.</hi> That which in such case might be expected, of which notwithstanding we haue heere no mention at all, was, that they neuer repented them of their sinnes, nor turned to God to obtaine his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour: and yet it seemeth by the Text it selfe, that themselues acknowledged it was <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> the Lord that did it. So hard a thing is it when we are growne olde in sinne, truely to repent and turne vnto God: euen when wee our selues doe see, that his hand is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> stretched out against vs to cut vs off cleane, if in no good measure wee will not in time turne vnto him.</p>
            <p n="3">3 In this sort they being come ouer, and wee beeing now to see, what is the Story of their doings there, we quickly finde, that most of their doinges doe most <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> concerne the whole people: but some of them, but certaine of them. Those that concerne the whole people, are chiefely about the dispatch of that businesse for which they specially came thither, which was to make a Conquest of that Land, and to take it vnto themselues: but first we haue other thinges going before; then, how they got the Land vnto them. Of those other thinges going before, there bee two sorts likewise: some, that albeit, as it fell out, they were done heere, yet by the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of them they were not proper to this place, but might haue beene done any where else: others, that were proper to this very place, and so of right were heere to be done. Of those that were not proper to this place, but might haue beene done any where else, there be but two: one of them, now required by God himselfe; the other, yeelded of his people, as the time did then put them in minde. That vvhich
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:7530:116"/> was now by God required, was, that all the whole people, in a manner, should nowe <note place="margin">Ios. 5: 2.</note> be circumcised. Concerning which, some thinges there are that are plain enough: others, that haue some difficulty in them. Those that are plaine enough, are, that they were vncircumcised before: but that they must be circumcised now. That they were vncircumcised before, it is not onely plaine in it selfe (fot the most part of them) but as strange withall, that so speciall a point of their profession, euen one of they: Sacraments, should be so generally, and so long together, omitted by all, in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: especially, at that time also, in the Wildernesse, when by the Law of the Passe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer it was so strictly required, and one Passe-ouer (we are sure of) was helde then <note place="margin">Leu. 12: 3. Num 9: 1-5. Ex 12: 43, 48 Num. 9: 13.</note> generally of them all (whereof the vncircumcised might not bee partakers) and spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall threatnings cast foorth against those that at any time held it not when it was to be holden; and when so fearefull iudgements were now and then cast vppon diuers of their transgressions. But thereby may we see, that they were exceeding carelesse of this point of duty: and that God bare very much with them, so to spare them as he did, when they notwithstanding were so great offenders in this. That they must bee circumcised nowe, in their Enemies Land, to their very great disaduantage, if the Enemie should set vppon them, it is a good tryall of theyr Fayth; and a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable checke to the former slacknesse: a tryall of their Faith, in that it made <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> proofe of them, whether they could so firmely rest on Gods protection, as that now they could yeelde to put themselues to such disability of resisting the Enemy if need should be; a checke to their former slacknesse, in that seeing they had so little regard of it before, when safely they might, now must they doe it in speciall danger. Those <note place="margin">Ios. 5: 5.</note> that haue some speciall difficulty in them, are two places of the Text it selfe: one, that all the people that came out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> were circumcised; the other, that after it was done, the Lord himselfe saide vnto <hi>Iosuah,</hi> that hee had that day taken away <note place="margin">Ibid. 9.</note> from them the shame or reproach of <hi>Aegypt.</hi> As touching the former, if the Text may beare it, to bee spoken according to the common reputation, or as they were taken (as if the sense were, that of those that came out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> there was no quaestion made of them, but that they were circumcised; but that in the Wildernesse circumcision was for the most part omitted) that may seeme to bee more agreeable to the Story of them: and to that speech of the Lord himselfe. In the Story of them, both there is no such thing recorded of them: and their estate was (for the most part of their time) such there, as that by likelihood circumcision was with them but little regarded. The Story of them (of their first going thither to soiourne; of theyr estate while they were there; and of their deliuerance thence (beginning with the sixe and fortith Chapter of <hi>Genesis,</hi> endeth with the foureteenth of <hi>Exodus:</hi> and the Text in all that compasse mentioneth no such matter of them. <hi>Iacob</hi> himselfe, his <note place="margin">Ge. 46: 1. Ex. 14: 31.</note> twelue Sonnes, and all their Issue Male, when they went downe theither, being, with <hi>Ioseph</hi> and his two Sonnes, which were there before (to the number of three-score and ten) were, no doubt, all circumcised (certaine of them, without question; the <note place="margin">Gen. 34: 14, 15, 22.</note> rest by likely-hood) vnlesse it were then wanting in those two Sonnes of <hi>Ioseph,</hi> being as then he was so setled in <hi>Aegypt:</hi> and so by likely-hood al the rest, so long as <hi>Ioseph</hi> and the chiefe and principall Fathers among them liued, and had not clasped about their neckes that yoake of bondage. For while they were well (as they were for a good time at the first) it is most likely, they did so comfortably in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy that their estate in God, that they looked to enioy the rest of his promises vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, and so the more diligently kept by that Sacrament, in their owne bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, the memorie of them. But when after they were vsed as bond men, and that in verie hard measure too, and better than fourescore yeares together, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer was more (for so old was <hi>Moses</hi> before their deliuerance, and at his byrth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> they were exceeding hardly vsed, as also we know not how long before) how far <note place="margin">Act. 7: 23, 30</note> the most part of them were like to slip such matters then, euen the example of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> himselfe may giue vs a reasonable faire ghesse, for that himselfe had one of his <note place="margin">Exo. 4: 24-26.</note> Sonnes vncircumcised, when hee was of the age aforesaide, and when God did send him about their deliuerance. Neuerthelesse so many of them as feared God indeede, did by all likely-hood (for the most part of them) diligently obserue that
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:7530:117"/> Sacrament: and because it was ministred vnto them while they were children, and so before them-selues could take knowledge of it, and in such case men are wont to presume the best of themselues, therefore might they all be accounted as circumcised, though so it were that many of them were not. This also is termed <note place="margin">Ios. 5: 2. Ge. 17: 9-14 23-27.</note> the second time of ministring circumcision, in so set and generall manner: and we haue no Story of any other, since that of <hi>Abrahams.</hi> For as for that other which by certaine of the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> is pretended to haue beene, immediately before they departed out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> besides that we haue no authority for it, wee haue verie <note place="margin">

And then is not the Text against it. As touching the other, namely, that speech of the Lorde himselfe, that then he had taken away from thē the reproch of <hi>Egypt,</hi> the difficultie <note place="margin">Ios. 3: 9.</note> of it onely is, if the other be an affirmatiue, or do plainly say, that all the <hi>Israelites</hi> that came out of <hi>Aegypt</hi> were circumcised. For then it appeareth not, what the reproach of <hi>Aegypt</hi> should be: and it would be rather expected, that the Lorde would in that case haue tearmed it the reproach of their wandering estate in the wildernesse. Which difficulty hath brought to passe, that sundrie interpretations <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> (and those farre enough off) are brought by the best Interpreters we haue: euen to the darkening of the Text it selfe. Whereas if it may bee taken, but as not medling with those that came out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> wherher they were circumcised, or not; and that the Lord, by this his speech, may be presumed to tell vs the trueth for that matter: then, may we easilie perceiue what the reproach of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> was; and that the Lord might rather tearme it the reproach of <hi>Aegypt</hi> as being learned of them there, than the reproach of their wandering estate in the Wildernesse, where they did but put in practise what they had learned before. But that then they did put it in practise, and that in great and straunge measure, is very plaine, for that being none but their children that were then to be circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and those but from time to time as they came, one after another, and seuerally, that might they haue done very easily, not onely when they did rest, but also when they: rauelled most: their children at that age being euer carryed, and waies to carry them so easily, that the wound should be no more paineful to them when then trauelled, then when they rested. And therefore was it a wonderfull ouersight in them, who so easily and so long a time slipt so great a dutie: and that, when the eye of the Master was most vpon them; and the rod euer tyed, as it were, to their backe. That which was yeelded of his people, as the time then did put them in minde, was the obseruing of the Pas-ouer, immediately ensuing. For on the tenth day they came in, and this was to be solemnized the fourteenth day at night; the Feast of vnleauened Bread continuing seauen dayes after. But in this we haue not onely this Story it selfe: but also another appendant vnto it. This Story it selfe <note place="margin">Ios. 5: 10, 11.</note> is no more, but that the people did not then omit that holy solemnity, or that part of their seruice to God, notwithstanding that now they were in the land of their enemy, and at this their first entring might in reason looke for what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer hostility the enemie was able to force vpon them. A better example for vs to follow, then such direction as flesh and blood doth in such case minister vnto vs; telling vs oft-times, that such matters are to giue place for the time, and then to be attended of vs, when wee haue better leisure vnto them: as if to bee carefull of Gods seruice (of whom onely commeth whatsoeuer good successe wee
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:7530:117"/> haue in any thing, whatsoeuer it is we haue in hand) were no good way to come to the end of our desire. And it is very true, that in such case such seruice of God is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> sometimes to giue place, as vnto some greater seruice of his: but then must it bee greater indeed, and vngodly prophanenesse must neuer giue vs any part of our di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection therein. That which is but onely an appendant hereunto, is that ceasing of <hi>Manna:</hi> and that, by occasion that the people being to keepe this solemnity <note place="margin">Ibid. 11, 12.</note> with vnleauened Bread, they, to that end, tooke of the corne of the land (being har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uest time then with them) and so entring into the fruition of the fruits of the land, now they had Manna no more. And God is not wont to faile any of his, in such things as are needfull for them heere, vntill he bring them to those better things, that in the land our inheritance he meaneth to giue vs.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Of those that were proper to this very place, and so of right where heere <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> to be done, some of them were done by God: and some by his people. Those that were done by God, were two: one, that now at the beginning he would giue them a tast, whence all their victories were to proceede; the other, in what way or course of theirs they might account to enioy his fauour. The tast that now in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning he would giue them, whence all their victories were to proceed, was in his manner of giuing <hi>Iericho,</hi> the next citie vnto them: wherein first wee are to note, what direction he gaue vnto <hi>Iosuah</hi> for the obtaining of it; then, how accordingly he gaue it vnto him. In the direction that he gaue him we are to consider, first of his appearance to that end: then, of the direction it selfe. In his appearance he did nor onely shew himselfe to <hi>Iosuah:</hi> but withall, gaue him some priuate instruction vnto himselfe. He appeared vnto him, first but shewing himselfe to the eye: but then soone after, telling him plainely who he was. When he did but shew himselfe to the eye, he appeared as a man of armes, of some speciall note, or as some Captaine, <note place="margin">Ios. 5: 19.</note> with his sword in his hand drawne. At which time <hi>Iosuah</hi> did no more but went vnto him, and enquired whether he was to be with them, or with their enemies. When, by this accasion, he tould <hi>Iosuah</hi> what he was, then <hi>Iosuah</hi> both fell downe and worshipped him, and enquired what it pleased him to say vnto him. In the <note place="margin">Ibid. 14.</note> priuate instruction he gaue to himselfe, we are to note, not onely what it was: but also, what time it was giuen vnto him. It was, to loose his shooes from his feete; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> telling him withall, that the ground whereon he stood was holy: thereby teaching him (as he taught <hi>Moses</hi> before) to stirre vp himselfe to some speciall reuerence. Both which if we lay together (the one of <hi>Moses,</hi> the other of <hi>Iosuah)</hi> that being a gesture of outward reuerence with them▪ as the putting off of the vpper Bonet with vs, hence may we gather, that the Lord requireth, in his holy assemblies, such out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward reuerence, not onely of meaner men, as of <hi>Moses</hi> before, but also of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter sort too (euen of the greatest of al) as of <hi>Iosuah</hi> now. The time wherein this was giuen vnto him, was when he had humbled himselfe alreadie euen to the ground: a sufficient warning to vs, that when we humble our selues most, euen then are wee a great deale short of that which we should. Comming vnto the direction it selfe, it was about Iericho, a speciall citie thereby, now shut vp for feare of the Israelites, but yet soone after giuen into their hands, without any policie or force of warre. Concerning which, first we are to note, in what case that citie stood yet: then how the people of God were directed, what course to take notwithstanding. The case wherein they stood as yet, was no more but this, that they did not seeke vnto God (that wee reade of) but gathered themselues vnder the protection of their owne <note place="margin">Ios. 6: 1.</note> strength: shutting vp their gates, that neither any of the Israelites might get in; nor any intelligence come forth vnto them. But as there is no wisdome nor strength against the Lord: so their shutting vp auailed them nothing at al, in the course that God meant towards them. For the course that <hi>Iosuah</hi> must take, was, that all the men of warre among them should euery day once for sixe dayes together (a faire <note place="margin">Ios. 6: 2-4.</note> time giuen them to repent, if they could) compasse the citie round about: the forty thousand of the two Tribes and an halfe first, then the Priests, both those seuen that bare the trumpets, and those others that bare the Arke, and after them the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">Ibid. 6-9.</note>
               <pb n="212" facs="tcp:7530:118"/> foure battails in their woonted order; the Trumpets onely sounding, and all the rest keeping silence. Which when they had done, then were they the seuenth day to compasse it in like manner seuen seuerall times: and at the last, when the Priests that bare the Trumpets (should at the seuenth time continue their blast long) then should all the people giue a shout withal, the best that they could, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at the wals of <hi>Iericho</hi> should fall round about; and then were they all to enter, eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <note place="margin">Ibid. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>.</note>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> one against the place where they stood. In that he did accordingly giue it vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, we are to consider of it, first as it is an earthly blessing: then as it may fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure another of better account. As it is an earthly blessing it was, as it were, the first possession of this land giuen vnto them: but yet, not to bee inioyed of them, but to be to the Lord abandoned; and yet some fewe of them to bee spared also. For when the Priests sounded their Trumpets, and the people shouted thereon, the <note place="margin">Ibid. 17-19. Ibid. 20.</note> w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap> of <hi>Iericho</hi> round about fell to the ground, and euery where gaue entrance to the enemie without, to their owne distruction within: as not able to abide the power that it pleased God then to put into the blast of those fewe trumpets, and to the shout of those his people ensuing thereon. The abandoning of it vnto the Lord altogether from their owne priuate vse, was but as touching the spoile of it: sentence being alreadie giuen of all the people, not onely of this Citie, but else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where also, to be distroyed. But for the spoile, it was in such sort to bee abando<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vnto the Lord, as that themselues were not to meddle with any part of it: and <note place="margin">Ibid. 17-19.</note> the Lord himselfe would haue into his treasure, but onely the mettall (as gold, sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, brasse, and Iron) such as was able to abide the fire; appointing all the rest (as their cattle both great and small, and most of their houshold-stuffe and apparell) to be vtterly distroyed. Whereunto <hi>Iosuah,</hi> making an vtter distruction of it for that <note place="margin">Ios. 6: 21, 24,</note> present, stayed not there, but by the spirit of prophecie also, as it appeared by that which followed, layed a farther cursse vpon it for the time ensuing: namely, that <note place="margin">Ibid. 26. 1. Kin. 16: 34.</note> it might neuer rise againe, but to some speciall ruine of the builder of it. In those fewe of them that were to be spared we are to consider, not onely who they were; but also, whereupon they were spared. They were <hi>Rahab</hi> the Harlot, that victua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling woman that receiued and hid those two spies of <hi>Iosuah,</hi> together with her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">Ibi. 22, 23, 25</note> and mother, her bretheren also and family, and al that she had: <hi>Iosuah</hi> himselfe giuing charge to those yong men that had beene his spies, to go and see her and all hers brought forth in safety; and they performing their charge accordingly. The reason whereon they were so spared, was the promise or Oath that those two spies <note place="margin">Ios. 2: 2-21.</note> had made vnto her, for helping to preserue them, from the danger that then they were in. A good example, not onely to all, to see how God prouideth for those that sort themselues to the good of his people: but also for those halfe bretheren <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> of ours the Church of Rome, and their adhaerents; who, by the virtue of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, make so little conscience of their Oathes, euen of alleagiance to their natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Princes, whom otherwise in duty and nature they ought by all good meanes to preserue, though they neuer had made any oath at all; when as these so religiously obserue their oath made to their inferiours, to heathenish Idolaters, and to those, whome (for their owne good) they were allowed, and aduised too, by the Lord himselfe, vtterly to distroy. As this entring of theirs to that earthly possession, may figure another of better account, there be diuers coniectures, that the ruine of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,</hi> and the dissolution or end of the world, is not far off now: and one speciall token is, that the earth is so lightned as in these dayes it is by the Gospell of Iesus Christ; and that it proceedeth with such power, as it is cleare that it doth. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by <note place="margin">Ma. 24: 27, 30 Ma. 13: 26, 27 Luc. 21: 17. 2. The. 2: 3, 8. Apoc. 18: 1, 2.</note> it shall not be amisse, if we also conceaue, that as when the Priests blew their trumpets, and people by their shouting accorded vnto them, then the wals of <hi>Ieri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho</hi> fell: so, when the seruants of God in the Ministery, sound their trumpets, by publishing and deliuering the word of God vnto the people, and the people ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaud or consent vnto it, in religious and zealous manner, the walls of this <hi>Iericho,</hi> first of Rome, then of the world, will also come tumbling downe at once. In what way or course of theirs they might account to enioy that fauour of God which then was towards them, is plainely declared in that which followed immediately
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:7530:118"/> after, the businesse of <hi>Ay,</hi> by the sinne of <hi>Achan;</hi> the Lord, for one mans sinne, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing a bitter snub vnto all: so to teach them, that if they would enioy that his fauour, they must (all the sort of them) diligently keepe themselues from all such offences, as himselfe should expresly forbid them. So are wee first to consider of their hard successe in attempting of <hi>Ay:</hi> then, how it pleased God, in the end notwithstanding, to giue it vnto them. In their hard successe in attempting of it, wee are first to see what it was: then, what was the occasion of it. The thing it selfe was, that sending thither three thousand men to take it and sacke it, according as they had learned <note place="margin">Ios. 7: 2-9.</note> before (by such as they sent to view it) that such forces would bee sufficient, they were put to flight, and sixe and thirty of them slaine: to the great discouragement &amp; sorrow, not onely of the common people; but also, of the Elders, &amp; <hi>Iosuah</hi> himselfe. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> A good warning to all, not slightly to attempt any speciall businesse, though it may seeme neuer so easie to be accomplished: it also seeming to be one of the errors heere committed. For, a while after we read, that there were slaine of all sorts of them twelue thousand: of which, if but the third part onely had beene able to make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance <note place="margin">Ibid. 8: 25.</note> (and that may wee conceiue must needs be so, and many moe rather) yet these being in the Citty within, must needs be a great ouer-match for three thousand to assaile it without. The occasion or cause of it was, that <hi>Achan</hi> one of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany at the ouerthrow of <hi>Iericho,</hi> purloyned away to his owne priuate vse certaine <note place="margin">Ibi 7: 1, 20, 21</note> things that he ought not to haue medled with, being before forbidden to all: some of them such, as should haue gone to the Lords treasury; and one that should haue beene destroyed. Those that should haue gone to the Lords Treasury, were, that tongue or wedge of Golde, of the waight of fifty Shekels: and the two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered shekels of Siluer. That which shoulde haue beene destroyed, was that goodly BABYLONISH garment: nothing at all the more to bee spared before the Lord for the beauty of it; but the rather, as appertaining to the pomp of pride, to be destroyed. The much like fault that many of vs are of long smitted withal, hauing taken away to our propper vse much of the needfull maintenance of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry, that before was well and orderly giuen vnto it: and daily yet dooing it more and more: little regarding, in comparison of our owne profit, pomp, or pleasure, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that those things should still haue remained to the Lords Treasury; or that the vse that we do make of them, is already condemned vnto destruction. But if hee, being but one, brought so heauy an hand of God on them all: what may wee iustly doubt to be towards vs, that are so many; so great, so often, and grosly therein of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending? How it pleased God in the end notwithstanding to giue it vnto them, to the end we may the better finde, we are to note, how it pleased God, first to make a way vnto it: then, how he did afterward yeeld it. He made a way first vnto it, both by framing them to seeke vnto him: and by remouing out of the way, that which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise might hinder them in it. To the end they might seeke vnto him, he first <note place="margin">Ibid. 5. 9.</note> touched their hearts with amazednesse, discouragement, and sorrow: then, did hee put that also into their hearts withall, namely, to seeke vnto him, in whom the good of their whole estate they found to consist. That which other-wise might hinder <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> them of it, was some part of it in him that offended: and some part of it in themselues <note place="margin">Ios. 7▪ 10-12. Ibid. 13-21. Ibid. 22-26.</note> now. That which was in him that offended, had hindred them before, and (as God himselfe told them) would hinder them still, till it was amended: and therefore did he both direct and helpe them to finde it out; and caused it to be accordingly puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed. That which was in themselues now, was that discouragement that they had of that hard accident before, and it may bee, some conceit yet abiding with them, that that being so small a Citty, they should not neede any great forces yet to gaine it. God therefore, first for the former, both encourageth <hi>Iosuah,</hi> and assureth him <note place="margin">Ios 8: 1: 2.</note> to giue him the Citty; and alloweth the people now, to take the spoile thereof to themselues: for the latter, both he willeth <hi>Iosuah</hi> to take all the men of warre with <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> him; and teacheth them to vse pollicy also. Which if wee can rightly apply vnto our selues, needs must we graunt, that although God, by his great and infinite po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, be able to do the greatest thinges that are, without any meanes, euen with a be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ke: yet are we so weake in our selues, that wee had neede to vse both all our
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:7530:119"/> strength and pollicy also, euen in the least duties we haue (that he enioyneth) right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to do them. Hauing made this way vnto it, then to yeeld them the thing it selfe, <note place="margin">Ibid. 3-17 Ibid. 18-29.</note> both he frameth them to vse the meanes that he appointed: and himselfe doth pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per the same, to the full effecting of it. Those that were done by those his people, by <hi>Iosuah</hi> and the rest of the <hi>Israelites,</hi> were of two sorts: one, whereby they direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted some worship towardes God; other two, whereby they deriue instruction to men. That one whereby they directed some worship towards God, was the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <note place="margin">Ibid. 34, 31.</note> of that Altar, dooing it in such sort as God required to bee but momentane or for the time (to leaue the honour vnto the other that was to stand:) and their offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of Burnt-offerings, and Peace-offerings thereon. Those other two, whereby they deriue instruction to men, were one of them, that writing of the Law or Ten-Commandements on those stones plaistered for that purpose: the other, the reciting <note place="margin">Ibid. 32. <hi>Bibl. Angl Annot. in marg.</hi> Ibid 33-35.</note> of those blessings and curssings, at those two Mountains <hi>Garizim</hi> and <hi>Ebal,</hi> in such sort now, as God himselfe had appointed before. And if we when we come to such earthly blessings heere, as it pleaseth God to giue vs (as they now had this their first entering into that habitation of theirs) should in some set and actuall manner in such sort worship: as it should be so much the more aunswereable vnto the patterne that God heere prescribed to them, so were it most likely to prooue, both commodious and comfortable to vs and ours. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/>

            <p n="5">5 How they got the Land vnto them beeing now to bee seene, wee are to note, that they were no sooner left in that matter (as it were) to themselues, but that soone <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> they made a foule slip therein: but afterward notwithstanding, did acquite them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues reasonably well. The slip that they made, was with the <hi>Gibeonites:</hi> who, when all the rest of the Kinges and States of that Countrey, hearing what the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God had done already, determined, altogether to make warre on <hi>Israell,</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed themselues to another course, which was, to assay, whether they could handle the matter so cunningly, as to get a league of the <hi>Israelites.</hi> Concerning which, the Story doth shew vs, that although they made a slip therein: yet soone after did it turne to their good. As touching their slip therein, wee are first to note how cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly they were dealt with: then, how they were ouer-taken with it. In that these <note place="margin">Ios. 9: 1, 2. Ibid. 3-13.</note> turned to cunning and subtill dealing, we may first note, that now we haue two sorts of them, most of them that seeke to make their party good by strong hand, others that fly to craft and subtilty; neyther of them truely repenting, nor seeking vnto God for his helpe: then also, as touching the manner of it, that they vsed false out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward shewes, and plaine vntruths in speech, that so they might more easily deceiue. In that the <hi>Israelites</hi> (at least <hi>Iosuah</hi> himselfe, and the Elders) were ouer-taken therein, wee are to note, what may seeme to be the cause: and, how far they were ouer-taken. The cause seemeth to bee the same, that is noted in the Text it selfe: <note place="margin">Ibid. 14, 15.</note> namely, that they belieued that smooth tale of theirs, &amp; did not aske counsel of God. A good warning for many of vs. For this subtility of theirs, was (in a manner) but a very toy: and, on the other side, <hi>Iosuah</hi> and all the Elders of <hi>Israel</hi> we may account to bee altogether as wise, as are any of those affectioned Auncientes of this latter Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> or their adhaerents. Lesse maruaile then, if they bee so fouly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiled as they are, in matters of Doctrine and Faith, though their illusions were grosser than they are (if grosser might be) seeing they doe not forget, but wittingly, and of set purpose refuse, in those their conceites to aske counsell of God. Howe farre they were ouer-taken with them, it is good to note, both for that which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward they did vnto them: and for that which neither they did offer vnto them, nor durst before God to attempt it. That which afterward they did vnto them, was, <note place="margin">Ios. 9: 16-27.</note> that they made them as Bond-men, to doe seruile worke for them: a Chasticement little enough for so great dissimulation as it; and well that they had so much liberty <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> left in their handes, whereby they might chastice so fraudulent dealing. The peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God in their simplicity, are easily oft-times circumuented by the Children of the World: but God oft-times abaseth them for it; and leaueth in the handes of his, whereby to chastice such dealing with them. That which they durst not (euen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <note place="margin">Ibid. 18, 19.</note>
               <pb n="215" facs="tcp:7530:119"/> God) offer vnto them, was, to breake the Oath that they made them: though they were such, as God had, if not strictly willed to be destroyed, yet at least aduised his people so to doe; and they had gotten it onely by fraud. A good example for the adhaerents of this latter Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> in all Countries and States whatsoeuer that professe the Gospell, so easily breaking their Faith as they do, both to their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and to their Countrey: and the same in no ill manner obtained of them; but such as both duty and Nature, before God and Man, doe strictly require. How it turned soone after to their good, wee haue in the next Story ensuing. For seeing they had made peace with the Israelites, the rest of their Neighbours ioyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to make an vtter destruction of them. As with vs also it falleth out, that wee cannot truely leaue the society we haue with the World, and in our waies cleaue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to those that are the vndoubted Children of God, but that easily we bring vppon vs all the rest of our wonted Friendes, now to be our Enemies also: or, at least, so farre forth to diuide themselues from vs, as we therein diuided our selues from them. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could we haue so reasonable friendship of them as commonly we haue, but that whatsoeuer we would seeme to professe, yet the truth is, that wee make but little (if any at all) separation from them: neyther doe they see any at all, vnlesse their mindes be lesse or more alienated from vs. All the forces therefore of these parts being by this occasion gathered together against the <hi>Gibeonites,</hi> and they by that occasion see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to their newe confederates the <hi>Israelites</hi> for helpe, so falleth it out, that <hi>Iosuah</hi> hath them all gathered together, whom otherwise he might haue beene forced, with great labour, and long drift of time, to haue sought out, if they had still kept in sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
            <p n="6">6 This slip though they made at the first, yet neuerthelesse, that afterward they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> acquitted themselues reasonably well, the Story sheweth vs, that they did well pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute their businesse, till they had done whatsoeuer seemed to lie on the charge of all generally: but what they did after, wee finde not so woorthy of commendation. That which seemed to lie on the charge of all generally, was, first, to get the Land vnto them: then, to make such distribution of it as was appointed. They got the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Land vnto them, in a manner, by striking two battails with them: and by one peece of seruice besides. Those battailes were, one in the South part of the Land, where now we are: the other, in the North. In the South, by what occasion those Kings and their forces were gathered together, we haue heard already. These therefore being come together and besiedging <hi>Gibeon,</hi> the <hi>Gibeonites</hi> beeing ouer-matched with them, sent vnto their new confederates to come to their ayde: whereuppon the <hi>Israelites</hi> come and ioyne battle with them, and doe giue them a great ouerthrowe; and not onely to those that then were assembled, but to many others besides. But heere it shall bee good more specially to consider; first, of the comming of <hi>Iosuah</hi> with the rest of the <hi>Israelites</hi> vnto the ayde of these <hi>Gibeonites</hi> now: then, of the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse they had therein. As touching their comming vnto the aide of the <hi>Gibeonites</hi> now, it is good to note; first, that they came: then also, the manner of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming. That they came, there is no quaestion: but whereas wee read withall, that <note place="margin">Ios. 10: 7, 8. <hi>Tremel. I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </note> God encouraged him to that expedition, which in the Text followeth after, but is conceiued by some to haue gone before, eyther of those considered a-part by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, may giue seuerally instruction to vs. For if <hi>Iosuah</hi> and the <hi>Israelites</hi> resolued, and set in hand with that voyage first, before the Lorde gaue them any such encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement, then haue wee two lessons therein: one, in <hi>Iosuah</hi> and the people; the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in the Lord himselfe. In <hi>Iosuah</hi> and the people, that now they had a faire op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity (if they could dispense with themselues, for their promise and oath made vnto them) to be vtterly rid of that whole people, that had so beguiled them before, and thereby were to enioy a good part of the Land (and euen in the heart of the Countrey) which otherwise GOD had giuen to the <hi>Israelites:</hi> because if they had stayed their handes, those other forces that came against them, were likely enough soone to haue made an vtter riddance of them. So shoulde they praesently haue bin freed of their Oath made vnto them, and haue seene the ouerthrow of those that
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:7530:120"/> had so ill beguiled them: and shortly after, haue had their Land in possession also. But hauing ioyned with them in league before, though not a little to their praeiudice then, and discontentment immediatly after, yet they wil not faile them now: Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing to vs a notable example, euer to detest such infidelity and faithles dealing, as so vsuallie is found, as with al the Children of the world generally, so especially (in these dayes of ours) with this latter Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and their adhaerents. In the Lord, that he staying till they were resolued, would first see what themselues would doe, before <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> he would step in with them: and then encouraging them so well as hee did, dooth therein seeme to reward that good and faithfull dealing in them. But if that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement of the Lord went before, then seeing they goe now to helpe the <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beonites,</hi> by the vertue of Gods speciall appointment, thereby may wee gather, that it was not a praecise commaundement, that they should desttoy all the <hi>Canaa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites</hi> (as before wee sawe:) but rather, that they were, both allowed so to doe; and, for their good, seriously aduised also, not to suffer any of them to liue among them. In the manner of their comming, it is plaine, euen by the course of the Text it selfe, that first they had that encouragement of GOD, before they did actually finish or <note place="margin">Ibid. 8, 9.</note> performe this voyage: and yet notwithstanding they vsed their pollicy and industry in it, trauailing towardes them all the night, that so on the suddaine they might come vpon them. And so, though we haue neuer so faire promises of God: yet must we take heed, that we vse such meanes as he hath ordained, an I neuer despise any works of his wisedome. The successe that they had therein, was some part of it in the ouerthrow of those forces that vnder those fiue Kinges of the South were now ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together: and part of it, in the ouer-throw of others besides. In the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of those forces that were now gathered together, the successe that they had, was, partly against them all generally: and partly, against the Kinges more specially. The successe that they had against them all generally, was, partly but such as is vsuall in such ouerthrowes: but other part such, as was peculiar or proper to this. That which is vsuall in such ouerthrowes, was, that the <hi>Israelites</hi> in such sort pursued <note place="margin">Ios. 10: 10, 19 20. Ibid. 11.</note> them, that most of them that day were ouer-taken and slaine. That which was pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar or proper to this, was, both that God himselfe cast vppon the Enemy such a storme of Haile, and the Haile-stones thereof so verie great, that exceeding many were slaine thereby: and, that hee allowed <hi>Iosuah</hi> to stay both the Sunne and the Moone, for about twelue houres aboue the earth, longer than was their ordinary <note place="margin">Ibid. 12-14.</note> course, that so hee might haue time to prosecute that execution, to the vttermost that they were able. That which they had against the Kinges more specially, was, that <note place="margin">Ibid. 16, 17.</note> whereas they had hid themselues in a Caue altogether, <hi>Iosuah</hi> both got vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of them, and making them fast there till hee had ended that daies pursuite, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed <note place="margin">Ibid. 18 21. Ibid. 22▪27.</note> them then to bee brought foorth vnto him, and making his Captaines first to set their feete on their neeks (the better to embolden them against those that remained) he then did execution on them, and left to posteritie a monument of it. Those o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers <note place="margin">Ibid. 28-42.</note>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> besides, were certaine chiefe and principall Citties in those South-parts, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with their Kinges and peoples: and another King and his Army, who came to the ayde of one of those Citties distressed by <hi>Iosuah.</hi> Which Citties were, <hi>Mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keda, Libnah, Lachish Eglon, Hebron</hi> (together with other Citties to it appertaining) and <hi>Debir.</hi> All which in that voyage hee tooke and destroyed, and put the people thereof to the Sword: and so subdued, in that one voyage, all that South part of the Countrey. Which when he had done, then he returned with all his Hoast to <hi>Gilgal</hi> againe, where yet they encamped. Of that in the North, the discomfiture that <note place="margin">Ibid. 15, 43.</note> the <hi>Canaanites</hi> had in this, may seeme to be the first occasion. For thereuppon it is said, that <hi>Iabin</hi> one of the Kinges there, and such as of olde bare a principall sway ouer all the rest, sent for all those other Kings (to the number of foure &amp; twenty, as <note place="margin">Ios. 11: 1-5, 10.</note> it seemeth, or there about) together with the forces of euery of them, and gathered them together to the Waters of <hi>Merom</hi> (the first Sea, <hi>Mere, Lough,</hi> or <hi>Tarn,</hi> that <hi>Iordan</hi> maketh, spreading it selfe into a great breadth there) to fight against <hi>Iosuah</hi> and the <hi>Israelites:</hi> all which beeing gathered together, besides that they had excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding many Horses and Charets, are said to be (for their multitude) like vnto the sand

These beeing thus gathered together, if now he would see what became of them, we are first to see what became of this whole company being yet together: then, what became of their seuerall forces, when once they were broken. While they were yet together, <hi>Iosuah</hi> beeing first encouraged <note place="margin">Ibid. 6-9.</note> by the Lorde, and assured of victory, both hee and all the men of Warre with him, came suddainely vnto them, set vpon them, praeuailed against them, destroyed many of them, houghed their Horses, and burnt their Charets. As touching those seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall forces, that after remained, it is saide, <hi>Iosuah</hi> had long warre with them, which, <note place="margin">Ibid. 18. <hi>Tremel.

Where also it is specially noted, that none of all these sought any peace at the handes of <hi>Israell,</hi> and that the Lord left them to their owne wilfulnesse therein, that so they might haue no mercy shewed them, but that they might vtterly perish. So came it to passe, that the <hi>Israelites</hi> mightily prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed <note place="margin">Ios. 12: 7-24.</note> and destroyed one and thirty Kinges of that people (such as they were, but of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> seuerall Territories onely) together with all their forces to speake of: and nowe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came so fearefull to those scattered forces that yet remained, that none of them durst make head against them.

Now therefore doth the Lord both put him in mind, that there is much Land yet to be gotten into their possession: and dooth set him in hand, nowe to diuide all among them, that euery one of the Tribes may know their portion, &amp; what it is that they may require as due vnto them, that yet is kept by the Enemy from them: which when hee hath accordingly done, then doe the <hi>Israelites</hi> giue vnto him his portion also. As touching which diuision <note place="margin">Nu. 34: 16. 29</note> or distribution, order was taken before, who should be the chiefe doers in it: name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Eleazar</hi> the High-Priest (and he hath the first place in it) and <hi>Iosuah</hi> their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour now: and, with them, one principall Father of euery Tribe; which also are all named before by God himselfe. And albeit these were like to be as indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent and wise as could be chosen, yet to content all parties the better, and to shew withall that what God hath fore-shewed, would stand vnmooueable euen in the <note place="margin">Nu. 26: 52-56. &amp; 33: 54.</note> casualty of lots also, order was in like sort taken, that it should be done by lot: yet in such sort, that wheresoeuer the lot did fall, there if they were moe people, they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> should haue so much the more Land to inhabit; and if they were fewer, so much the lesse. According to which order, it seemeth they set in hand with this distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution, soone after that God had called vpon them about it: but that some way or other it brake off, and was not finished at that praesent. For first, it seemeth, they <note place="margin">Ios. 14: 6.

Whereas therefore other two Tribes and an halfe (besides those that had <note place="margin">Ibid. 2, 5, 6. Ios. 14: 6. 15: 10-3 Ios 14: 6. 16: 1-9.

In which case, his remedie was, to speede himselfe to one of those Cities, which hee might be able best to recouer, there to be safe, till his cause should come to indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent hearing, or to the death of the High-Priest that should be in those dayes. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Of which, three of them were appointed before, on the East side of <hi>Iordan: Bezer,</hi>

            <p n="8">8 Of those their doings that concerne but certaine of them, we haue but little <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Story remaining: but that which we haue, is first of those two Tribes and an halfe, that came ouer to helpe their Bretheren; then, of certaine other particular persons. That which we haue of those two Tribes and an halfe, resteth in two principall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: one, how they were dismissed or sent away; the other, of a speciall care that themselues had, neuer to bee disclaimed by the rest of their Brethren. As tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching their dismissing or sending away, we are to consider first of the time, when it was done: then of the manner of doing it. For the time we haue but two limitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of it: namely, that it was not till the Tabernacle was brought vnto <hi>Siloh</hi> (which was before the Land was fully diuided, as wee saw before;) nor till the Land was in rest from all their Enemies. For the former of these the Tabernacle was brought vnto <hi>Siloh</hi> in the eighteenth Chapter: and these are not dismissed but in the two and twentith. At which time also, it is not to bee doubted, that the Tabemacle was at <hi>Siloh,</hi> both because these two Tribes and an halfe were dismissed thence, and for that the Congregation assembled thither immediatly after. In like sort, that it was <note place="margin">Ios. 22: 9. Ibid. 12.</note> not till the Land had rest, is as plainely set downe a little before they were dismissed. A manifest token of their good dealing with their Bretheren, in that they stayed so <note place="margin">Ios. 21: 43. 45</note> constantly with them from their own homes so many yeares: fully performing what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer <note place="margin">Na. 32. 20 33</note>
               <hi>Moses</hi> had giuen them in charge, and they had promised. In the manner of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> their dismissing wee are likewise to note, in how good sort <hi>Iosuah</hi> did it: and, howe they accordingly departed home-ward. That hee doth it in good sort, wee may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily see, both in that he calleth vpon them to that end: and much more, in that which proceedeth from him, when hee hath so called them. In that to this end he calleth them, it doth sufficiently argue, that hauing done their duty already, he would not <note place="margin">Ios 22: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

In word, both hee acknowledgeth that they had very well dischar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged that point of their duty: and giueth them a good exhortation withall, howe to <note place="margin">Ios 2-<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

His deed is, that he doth blesse them, &amp; dismisse them: and in dismissing them, dooth likewise let them so goe, withall that great and rich prey which they had gotten: a thing that diuers Captaines since would much haue stuck at. They being thus dismissed, do accordingly repaire home-wards. As touching the care that themselues had, neuer to be disclaimed by their Bretheren, there beganne <note place="margin">Ibid. 6, 9.</note> to bee some businesse about it: but then taking a moderate course, it was quickly stayed. There began to be businesse about it, in their manner of vttering of it: and in their Bretheren mistaking of their meaning therein. Their manner of vttering <note place="margin">Ios. 22▪ 10.</note> that feare of theirs that they conceiued, and their deuise to praeuent the same, was, that on the one side of <hi>Iordan</hi> as they went ouer (for the Text doth not to certainelie shew on whether side it was, but that the learned vame about it: though it seeme vnto me, there is greater likelihood, they should doe it on their owne side rather than on the other) they erected a large Altar (in the way of a Monument) such as easilie might be seene some good distance off. In doing of which, although they had no
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:7530:123"/> such ill meaning as was conceiued: yet was it such as was very subiect to such suspiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and therefore not so aduisedly done, without the priuitie of their Bretheren, as had beene expedient. Their Bretheren did so farre mistake it, that they were in <note place="margin">Ibid. 11, 12.</note> great feare, that they had turned themselues from their profession, and were setting vp Idolatry among them: and therefore gathered themselues to warre vppon them. But then inclining themselues to some more moderate course, in the meane season <note place="margin">Idid. 13-34.</note> they sent to their Bretheren to vnderstand their meaning therein; and (so perceiuing that it was not done of any such purpose, but onely set vp as a monument vnto po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity, that although they dwelt on the other side of <hi>Iordan,</hi> yet were they all one people with the other, both in linage, and in profession of Religion) they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented, and so departed: leauing a notable example to vs, the one sort of them, to nourish in vs a singular care, both for our selues, and for our posterity, euer to keepe fast vnto God; and the others, in no wise to beare with any starting from the truth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> of Religion, no not in our Bretheren, nor when our variance about it might bee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamely (as with them it was) dangerous to both. That which we haue of certaine other particular persons, is most of <hi>Iosuah</hi> himselfe: but something of others. That which we haue of <hi>Iosuah</hi> himselfe, is but how well hee did close vp the course of his life: and then, of his death. In the closing vp of the course of his life, wee finde, that as he was carefull (in all the time of his gouernment) of them, to keepe them to God: so now at his death hee was very desirous to leaue them with him. A good example for all: when we see that our time cannot be long heere now, but that God will shortly take vs hence, then to haue some speciall care of such as we leaue behind vs, especially of those of whom wee haue charge, to leaue them with God the best that we may. A point of duty that on all handes is of vs neglected: the most part of vs hauing had so little respect to godlinesse in our life time for our selues, that wee haue it not in vs at our deaths for others; but dropping away altogether as senselesse of such matters at our deaths, as wee haue beene carelesse thereof in our liues. In what sort <hi>Iosuah</hi> sought to performe that good peece of seruice to God, though the Text bee plaine enough for the sustance of it; yet in one point of lesse importance, <note place="margin">Maister Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uin on Ios. 24: 1.</note> one of our best Interpreters otherwise conceiueth than seemeth to bethe iudgment of others generally: namely, that whereas by the course and reading of the Text, it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, that <hi>Iosuah</hi> called in the Heades of the people two seuerall times about this matter; and some there be, that in plaine tearmes set down their iudgement so to be, <note place="margin">

But because, beside his owne iudgement (which in most thinges indeede is great, and not lightly to be aesteemed) hee bringeth no other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, but that it was not <hi>Consentaneum, bis eadem de causa populum extrahere in alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num</hi>

               <hi>locum:</hi> that is, That it was not meete to drawe the people so farre from home, twice for one matter, I do not see but that according to the iudgement of most men, and as the Text it selfe doth seeme rather to incline, wee may safeliest take it, as done at twice: both because the matter is of so special importance, that none of them had any iust cause to thinke much to bee called together twice about it; and because the course of proceeding in the one going farther then the other, doth yeeld that kinde <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> of variance betwixt them. At the first time therefore, because it appeareth not they gaue him any answer, it may well be, that his good admonition took not such place with them, as on their partes it ought to haue done: and that, for that cause the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he tooke some other time shortly after, to see if yet hee could praeuaile any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with them; and that God then did vouchsafe him a blessing of good successe, euen to his owne heartes desire. In the former of them hee frameth all his whole speech vnto them, but as from himselfe: in the latter, the most part of it from the Lord. In his former speech which he vttereth vnto them but as from himselfe, first he speaketh vnto them of his owne declining age: and then commeth to the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that was in his minde to deliuer vnto them. Of his owne declining age (it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth)
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:7530:124"/> he speaketh, as now wearing away so fast, that he cannot long be with them: <note place="margin">Ios. 23: 1, 2.</note> and therefore would gladly disburthen his mind vnto them, in that which now hee had to deliuer. The matter that now hee would deliuer vnto them tended altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to this end, to draw them to bee of mind, soundly to settle themselues to the Lord: and neuer to depart from him againe. To the end he may settle them sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the Lord, first he teacheth: then, he exhorteth. That which he teacheth, is of <note place="margin">Ibid. 3-5.</note> the great goodnesse of God towardes them: that of it they had good experience already, both in his hand on those other Nations for their sakes, and that now they had the whole Land diuided vnto them; and should haue more, in expelling the rest, that themselues might haue quiet possession. Hee exhorteteh two seuerall times: first, some-what more largely; then, but briefly. In that which is more large, wee are to consider whereunto hee did exhort them: and what reasons he vsed to moue them thereto. To find out whereunto he did exhort <note place="margin">Ibid. 6.</note> them, we are to note, that first he requiereth but generally, to obserue and do what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer is written in the Lawe, and not to turne aside, neither to the right hand, nor to the left; and therefore to bee of a valiant courage (insinuating thereby that such valour is to nothing more needfull, than to the obseruation of the lawe of God:) <note place="margin">Ibid. 7, 8.</note> then more specially, that they haue no societie with those <hi>Canaanites</hi> that are left, nor euer incline to their ill waies; but euer cleaue fast vnto the Lord in such sort, as (for that matter) yet they had done. The reasons hee vseth are two: one, for that he so stoode with them hitherto against their enemies; the other, for that hee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> would do so still. In that wherein hee doth it but briefly, hee requiereth no more, <note place="margin">Ibid. 9. 10.</note> but that they take good heede to themselues, that they loue the Lord their GOD. To the end they neuer depart from the Lord againe, he letteth them vnderstand how <note place="margin">Ibid. 11.</note> great euils shall in that case befall them: and howe they may assuredly know, that they cannot escape them. The euils that should find them, were, that God would driue out no mo of their enemies: and that, being left, they should become excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <note place="margin">Ibid. 12: 13.</note> grieuous vnto them. They might assueredly know, that they could not escape them (though himselfe must be gone, and could not tarry to giue them warning, or <note place="margin">Ibid. 14-16.</note> protest vnto them) by those things which already they saw to be accomplished: the consequence being very infallible, that as (now that they stoode in some feare of God) he had performed all that he promised vnto them, as themselues could witnes; so whensoeuer they should leaue him and turne vnto Idols, then should all those euils be likewise as certainely cast vpon them. In the latter, the most part whereof hee vttereth vnto them from the Lord, first for a time hee keepeth the speach to himselfe onely: then after, hee ioyneth with them in mutuall conference about the same that he had deliuered vnto them. While he keepeth the speach to himselfe alone, first hee speaketh vnto them in the name of the Lord: then, in his owne. That which he speaketh vnto them in the name of the Lord, resteth in two principall points: one, that of his owne goodnesse hee had taken them vnto him, when there was no desert <note place="margin">Ios. 24: 1-3.</note> in them, but were deepely sunke into grosse Idolatrie: the other, that euer since hee had stoode a good and a gracious Lord vnto them, first where they were but stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, in <hi>Canaan,</hi> and <hi>Egypt;</hi> then, bringing them to a Countrey that hee would giue them to bee their owne, both in the Wildernesse as they came thither, and in their <note place="margin">Ibid. 3-7. Ibid. 7-13.</note> Countrey when they came there, both on the one side of the Riuer, and on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Speaking in his owne name vnto them, most of that hee saith concerneth them: but some part of it, himselfe also. That which concerneth them, is another exhortation vnto them, to cleaue fast to the Lord, which that hee may the soundlier obtaine of them, he first exhorteth them vnto it: and then neuerthelesse doth leaue them vnto their owne liberty in it. In exhorting them vnto it, hee doth not onely <note place="margin">Ibid. 14.</note> require them sincerely to serue the Lord: but also (as a thing that inseperably goeth withall) to put away the Gods that their Fathers worshipped before. In leauing <note place="margin">Ibid. 15.</note> them vnto their owne libertie in it, he taketh the way, that may more surely bind them vnto it. For now they could not, in that fresh memorie of Gods great fauours to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes them, nor in the presence of so reuerend a personage, for very shame betake <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> themselues to any other: and yet taking it vpon their owne choyce too, needs must
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:7530:124"/> they cleaue faster vnto it. That which concerneth himselfe, was, that whatsoeuer choyce they should make, whether the Gods of their Fathers of old, or of that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple whereunto they were come now, himselfe notwithstanding, and his Familie, <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> would serue the Lord. Hitherto hauing kept the speach to himselfe (a thing to be wished, that such as among vs do euer delight themselues to be heard, would bee prouided of so godly and gracious speach as <hi>Iosuah</hi> now vsed) now doth hee as rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily ioyne with them, about the matter he hath moued vnto them: the effect where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of was (as also of his speach before, as it seemeth) to draw them to make a coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with God. Wherein we may see, first, that certaine speaches thereof passed too and fro betwixt them: then, that the thing it selfe was after effected. Of those speaches that thereof passed too and fro betwixt them, the first was of the people, giuing in their answere to this aforesaid speach of <hi>Iosuah:</hi> but then some other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, as <hi>Iosuah</hi> did after giue them occasion. In this their answere to that former speach of his, first they desire God to forbid (and God forbid it to all his people, <note place="margin">Ibid. 16.</note> now also) that they should forsake the Lord to serue other Gods: then, they shew whereon they ground that resolution of theirs, vpon those great deserts of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, both in times before passed, and then also; and so conclude, that he was <note place="margin">Ibid. 17, 18.</note> their God, and they would serue him. In those others besides, as <hi>Iosuah</hi> did occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion them, we are to consider what occasions he gaue them: and how they thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on gaue him answere againe. Those occasions were, one of them (as it were) to hould them off: others, but in some sort to receiue them. First he did (as it were) hould them off, so to make them prease-on more earnestly: telling them, that they were too rechlesse or carelesse, or at least too brittle a people, to serue him, for that he <note place="margin">Ibid. 19, 20.</note> was an holy, and iealous God; and therefore neither could he, nor would hee beare with their sinne, when they offended. But to this they answered, that they would not so bee held off: but that they would serue the Lorde. The other occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that <hi>Iosuah</hi> gaue them, were both to this end, that but in some sort he did receiue <note place="margin">Ibid. 12.</note> them. So first he gathered them to this consideration, that now they witnessed or <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> spake much against themselues, in that they would needes make their choyce of the <note place="margin">Ibid. 22.</note> Lord, if they should not afterward do accordingly. To which they granted it was so indeed. Then he willed them, to put away their strange Gods, and to bow their <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> hearts vnto the Lord the God of <hi>Israell:</hi> as if otherwise, they did but in vaine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse <note place="margin">Ibid. 23. Ibid. 24.</note> him. To that they did not fully answere: saying nothing of putting away those strange Gods that <hi>Iosuah</hi> conceaued they had among them; but yet protesting, that the Lorde their GOD they would serue, and that his voyce they would obey. Whereby it way seeme, that either they had none, as he conceaued: or else that they were not so ready yet to part with them; as indeede it is the manner of men to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue they may do both, as those mungrell. <hi>Isralites</hi> before, and our <hi>Romish</hi> Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques <note place="margin">2 King. 17: 29, 32, 33, 40, 41.</note> now. Howsoeuer it was, whether they had none indeed, or whether <hi>Iosuah</hi> could get no better of them, and so thought good to take what they gaue (rough hauer, of ill debters) he thereupon grew to the couenant with them. The thing it selfe therefore was now effected, <hi>Iosuah</hi> making a Couenant with them on the <note place="margin">Ibid. 25-28.</note> same: and both setting it downe it writing, and pitching vp a stone (with the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples consent too) for a Monument of it, and so dismissing the people withall. As touching his death, there is one thing that followeth so close vpon it, that although it respecteth others besides, yet seeing we find it there to be placed, and there is non that had better interest therein than he, therefore may we most safely so take it. So are we first to consider of his death it selfe: then, of that other, that doth follow so close vpon it. In his death it selfe wee haue no more, but that, after those thinges, being an hundred and ten yeare old he died, and was buried in his owne possession <note place="margin">Ibid. 29, 30. Iud. 2: 8, 9. Ibid. 31. Iud. 2: 7.</note> at <hi>Timnah-Serah.</hi> That other thing that followeth so close vppon it, is that <hi>Israell</hi> serued the Lord all the dayes of <hi>Iosuah,</hi> and all the dayes of the Elders that out-liued <hi>Iosuah,</hi> who had knowne all the workes of the Lorde, that he had done for <hi>Israel.</hi> So blessed a thing is it for the people to haue good Leaders: and especially such, as haue seriously giuen themselues, out of the word of God to learne, how it hath plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed God from time to time to deale with his people. Those others that are but two:

            <p n="1">1 <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T shall be good heere to remember how farre we haue gone. It <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> pleased God to take vnto him one people of all the world, to be a peculiar people to him: and, out of <hi>Abraham</hi> to raise the same. To <hi>Abraham</hi> he made (among others) two speciall promises: one, of the Land wherein hee soiourned; the other, of the Promised Seede. That of the Land, is now already performed vnto them: the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> beeing giuen to the <hi>Israclites,</hi> and they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing it now (at the death of <hi>Iosuah)</hi> in quiet possession. And in this part of theyr Story it is not amisse to marke, that with this his people he dealt at the first, by faire meanes onely: as Parents vse to deale with their Children in the time of their infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, vntill they come to some vnderstanding. This he did till they had beene his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple foure hundred and thirty yeares: and till the time that he had giuen them the law, with all the Ceremonies and Ordinaunces thereunto appertaining. But after that, though still they were in speciall fauour with him; yet did hee then diuers times min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle correction withall as they gaue him occasion: which, as wee haue seene in the Wildernesse already; so may wee see hence-forward also, wheresoeuer the people themselues are. Now at this time we are to see, what is their Story in that Land of theirs, vntill that <hi>Blessed Seede</hi> (the other of those two principall promises) be giuen vnto them vnto them: and first, so long as they stood one whole people; then, when after they began to be diuided. They continued one people, vnder all their Iudges, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and vnder one of their Kinges also: but after that, they began to be diuided. Their Iudges were all those Magistrates, Captaines, Leaders, or Gouernors, that it pleased God, after the death of <hi>Iosuah</hi> to raise vp vnto them as occasion was offered, vntill they had Kinges (at their owne motion) giue vnto them: of the most of which Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, we haue the Story in this praesent Booke of the Iudges; but of part of them, in another ensuing. As touching this praesent Booke of the Iudges, one particular Story there is, which appertaineth to the time of these Iudges, and yet is nothing at all mentioned heere in this Booke: but followeth next after in a little Booke by it selfe. So are we first to consider of the Story of them, as by this Booke we are dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted: then, to come to that other particular, in that other Booke next ensuing. As touching the Story of them, so farre as this Booke deliuereth it vnto vs, wee finde they were such, that the estate of the people vnder them, was reasonable good for a while at the beginning: but variable after. For a while at the beginning wee finde diuers thinges commendable in them, and so boading their estate then to bee good:
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:7530:125"/> some, that concerne the whole people; others, that concerne but certaine of their. Those that concerne the whole people, are two: one, that had his time immediately after the death of <hi>Iosuah;</hi> another, that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

But that is no sufficient reason, for that if these did slip the dutie to them ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaining, then might others be after appointed in their default: and yet by Gods ordinance, that dignitie giuen vnto them before. As touching that he addeth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, of what force the Gouernment of <hi>Iudah</hi> should be vnto them (telling them that <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iud.</hi> 1: 2.</note> he had giuen the land into his hands) the more comfortable that that might be vnto them, the more carefull should it haue made them, to haue yeelded themselues to that direction. For, that some restraine it to be meant not of the whole land ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally, <note place="margin">Tremel.

That which endured somewhat after, was that while the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <note place="margin">Iud. 2: 6-9.</note> sort remained that had seene many of these great workes of God, the people were kept (and so continued) in the seruice of God. How long that was, wee haue <note place="margin">Num. 1: 3.</note> not set downe: but seeing all that were twenty yeare olde and aboue, when they came new into the wildernesse, for their transgression perished there, sauing onely <note place="margin">Ibid. 14: 29. Ibid. 26. 64.</note>
               <hi>Iosuah</hi> and <hi>Caleb,</hi> therfore the Eldest of these besides could not bee but about threescore yeere olde when they came first into the land; and so might diuers of them liue many yeares after the yonger of these. Those that concerne but cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of them, are most of this people: but one of certaine strangers among them. Those that are of this people, are of one couple ioyning together: and of two o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that are but single. The couple that ioyned together, were the Tribes of <hi>Iudah</hi> and <hi>Simeon.</hi> For at soone as <hi>Iadah</hi> was named vnto the leading of the rest, <note place="margin">Iud. 1: 3.</note>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> he moued <hi>Simeon</hi> to helpe him in his Lot, or in the portion of his inheritance: offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring vnto <hi>Simeon</hi> withall to doe as much for him in his. And because afterward <note place="margin">Iud. 1: 17.</note> we reade that he went with <hi>Simeon</hi> indeed, therefore it seemeth there passed such a Leage betwixt them: and so is it taken by some. But if now wee consider what it was, that, by these two so ioyned together, was at this present done, though some part thereof we shall finde to be plaine ynough in it selfe: yet some other that may seeme now also to be done, we shall finde to lie somewhat doubtfull therein. That which is plaine inough of it selfe, is of two speciall Stories: one, that voyage of theirs against <hi>Bezek;</hi> the other, that which they made against the <hi>Philistims.</hi> In <note place="margin">Ibid. 4-7.</note> their voyage against <hi>Bezek</hi> they so preuailed, that they slew of the people of those parts tenne thousands, tooke the Lord or King thereof, and serued him as hee had serued many others before. In that other voyage of theirs against the <hi>Philistims,</hi> they tooke at that time three of their Citties, <hi>Azzah, Askelon,</hi> and <hi>Ekron,</hi> with the <note place="margin">Ibid. 18.</note> coasts or territories vnto them appertaining: but how soeuer it came to passe, shortly after (as in those affaires it is often seene) it appeareth they had them not. <note place="margin">Ibid. 3: 3.</note>
               <pb n="228" facs="tcp:7530:126"/> As touching those that lie so doubtfull, it shall be good, first to see, whence that doubtfulnesse ariseth vnto them: then, what those seruices themselues are. The doubtfulnesse that ariseth vnto them (so farre as my selfe doe yet see) commeth out of two principall heads: one, the mentioning of them else-where in the Text; the other, the interpretation of others thereon. Being elsewhere men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, as in the booke of <hi>Iosuah</hi> before, it may be theron more easily conceiued, that they were done then, rather than now. If vnto that semblance or likelyhood of the Text, the interpretation of those that are of reckoning, doe sort it selfe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, then doe we account it so much the more likely, that in truth it should be so ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. Both which will appeare more plainely in the places themselues that wee are to deale in. Those places therefore that of this kinde we are to deale in, are all of such seruices as by them were done, but whether at this time or before, that is the question: but some of them, for the right of the tribe of <hi>Iudah;</hi> and the rest, for the right of <hi>Simeon.</hi> Those seruices that were for the right of <hi>Iudah,</hi> were two: one, that of <hi>Ierusalem;</hi> the other, that of the Hil-country.

If then we may so reade, and most men so doe, if any should in such sort vary, they had need to haue some reason for thē why so they would vary. Then also, it is most likely, that this part of the Booke as well as the rest, was most intended, to shew what was the Story of the people at that very time of which it treateth (and this <note place="margin">Iud. 1: 1.</note> doth plainely shew it selfe, there to beginne when <hi>Iosuah</hi> ended): and not to bee a recapitulation, or a recitall of other Stories passed before. Which if it should be, it should leaue very little for the Story of that present: and seeme to defraude ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of those that then liued of that commendation that by right was due vnto them. Both which considerations doe appertaine to all the places that haue beene noted, indifferently. But now if we enter into a more speciall consideration of the places themselues, true it is, that the Kings of <hi>Ierusalem, Hebron, Debir,</hi> and <hi>Chorma,</hi> were all ouerthrowne before, and that the <hi>Israelites</hi> in <hi>Iosuahs</hi> time made great spoile of <note place="margin">Ios. 12: 10, 14 Ibid. 10: 29-42.</note> the Hilly Country. But might not the enemies that escaped nestle againe, and make those that now liued much businesse also? Are not such things in all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests very vsuall and rise? Is not one place, or one people in diuers cases, sundry times impugned and subdued, before they can bee brought to be quiet? Or is there <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> any thing spoken heere, that may not be a seuerall Story from those others before rehearsed? Or may it not goe for a reasonable coniecture, that therefore they set fire on <hi>Ierusalem</hi> now, and put <hi>Zephath</hi> to vtter destruction, because they would <note place="margin">Iud. 1: 8, 7.</note> not yet be quiet for that which before was done vnto them? So it seemeth to mee, that those also are Stories themselues, and seuerall from the others before recited.
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:7530:126"/> Those two others that were but single, are those that we haue heere set downe of the doings of <hi>Caleb</hi> at <hi>Hebron:</hi> and of the house of <hi>Ioseph</hi> at <hi>Bethel.</hi> Of <hi>Caleb</hi> it is <note place="margin">Ibid. 20.</note> saide, that he expelled from <hi>Hebron</hi> those three Gyants, the Sonnes of <hi>Anak.</hi> Of the house of <hi>Ioseph</hi> likewise, that they got <hi>Bethel</hi> which before was called <hi>Luz:</hi> sauing <note place="margin">Ibid. 22-26.</note> that heere that Praeterpluperfect Tense is againe very busie; and much more, as I doe take it, than it needeth to be. Those that were but strangers among them, were the <hi>Kenites,</hi> defended of <hi>Moses</hi> father in Law, of whom we reade, that they went <note place="margin">Ibid. 16.</note> vp with the children of <hi>Iudah</hi> to dwell among them: yet, as it seemeth, but in the Wildernesse or wast grounds neare vnto them; more wise therein, then most of the people of God themselues, esteeming so little as many of them did, of such soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etie with the tribe of <hi>Iudah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2 That their estate was variable after, the whole Story doth plainely and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> plentifully declare: but first it shall be good to consider, what may seeme to be the reason of it; then, what estate it was, that so they brought themselues vnto. As touching the former me-thinketh there was a farther cause than is commonly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued by others, or my selfe doe know to be noted by any. That which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly conceiued by others, is that they spared the inhabitants of the land so much as they did: and thereby brought themselues to great inconuenience. How they spared the Inhabitants of the land wee haue set downe but of certaine of them in particular: and of them all generally. In particular, but <hi>Iudah, Beniamin, Manasses,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iud. 1: 19, 21, 27-33.</note>
               <hi>Ephraim, Zebulon, Asher</hi> and <hi>Nepthalie,</hi> are noted to bee faulty therein: and one of them, the greatest tribe of all, is (after a sort) halfe excused in it, because it is said, that he was not able to doe it. But the reason is no more but this, because they had <note place="margin">Ibid. 19.</note> many Iron Charets. Which no doubt they had before, when neuerthelesse they were not able to stand against them. So that of <hi>Ruben, Simeon, Isacher, Gad,</hi> and <hi>Dan,</hi> we haue no such fault remembred in particular: sauing that being saide that the <hi>Ammorites</hi> droue the tribe of <hi>Dan</hi> (the greatest tribe next vnto <hi>Iudah)</hi> into the <note place="margin">Ibid. 34.</note> mountaine, though it doe not necessarily conclude, that they spared theirs (for they might be others that so straigtned them); yet notwitstanding it is most likely, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> they also were faultie therein. Generally it is saide of them all, that when they were strong, they did not expell them wholy, but onely made them tributaries vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <note place="margin">Ibid. 28.</note> them: and so it is saide of diuers of them in particular, as <hi>Zabulon, Nephtalie</hi> and <note place="margin">Ibid. 30, 33, 35.</note> the familie of <hi>Ioseph.</hi> The inconuenience that thereby they brought themselues vnto, was more, than may be well conceiued; but especially two principall heads, and whatsoeuer came in by them: one, that thence forward they should not bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to cast them out; the other, that thereby themselues did fall to Idolatry also. By the former of which, it would come to passe, that they must be exceedingly trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled and vexed by them: and by the other, that God would poure forth his wrath vpon them to their destruction. Of the former they are so seriously, and with such <note place="margin">Iud. 2 11-5.</note> contestation admonished, that they were wonderfull heauy to heare it, and poured forth teares so abundantly thereupon, that that one accident gaue name to the place where it was done. But it had beene good, they had wept before, and a good warning it is vnto vs, now that we are come to this promised land of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an profession, vtterly to destroy those ancient Inhabitants of our land also, all the bad motions of our corrupt nature; otherwise to assure our selues, that we cannot but be much encombred with them, in whatsoeuer work of godlines at any time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter we haue in hand. The latter tarryed not long after the former. For quickly they <note place="margin">Iud. 2: 10-25,</note> were by them corrupted: and for the same plentifully tasted of Gods displeasure. That farther cause that we finde not noted by others, doth so deepely touch them all, that few of them I thinke did stand cleare of it: especially, not the tribe of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah;</hi> then also it seemeth, none of the rest. The tribe of <hi>Iudah</hi> I take to be faulty, for that they did not take vpon them, according as God himselfe had called them. So are we to see, first how it pleased God to call them: then, how farre they failed therin. It pleased God in such sort to cal them as that they especially ought to haue had a speciall good regard vnto it: both for the direction that now was giuen
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:7530:127"/> them; and for some other things before concurring therewith, The direction that now was giuen them, was (as we heard before) that when the question was as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked <note place="margin">Iud. 1: 1, 2.</note> vpon the death of <hi>Iosuah,</hi> who should be their Leader next ensuing: answere was giuen, that it should be <hi>Iudah.</hi> By which answere wee may easily conceiue, that the Heads-man or Prince of that tribe was then to come in, and to take that charge vpon him: and, if among themselues there had beene any question, who was the chiefest (which it seemeth there was, not because we read of no question of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> it) God no doubt, would haue answered that point also. But there is a farther mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to bee noted, that God there nameth the whole tribe, and not the chiefe and principall Father of it (as before, when the people were to be numbred, or when af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Land was first to be searched, and then to be diuided among them): but <note place="margin">Num. 1: 7. Idid. 13: 7. Ibid. 34: 19.</note> now as appointing a set Gouernement to be among them. For the principall Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers die, one of them still succeeding another: but the tribe it selfe was euer to stand vntill the promised Seede should come, who should then take the Gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment vpon him, and of whose Kingdome there should be no end. So that heereby it seemeth, he rather pointeth to a continuall succession of Gouernours, euen vntill the time of Christ, then vnto any one for that present; commending vnto them that tribe, as the stock, familie or line, that euer should yeelde their Leaders vnto them: that euen as <hi>Leuy</hi> should yeeld their Priest-hood; so should <hi>Iudah</hi> beare their Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Those other things before that concurred with this now, were two: one, that Prophecy of <hi>Iacob;</hi> the other, a matter of fact a little before. The Prophecy of <hi>Iacob,</hi> for that dignity of <hi>Iudah,</hi> is more plaine, than that wee neede any thing to <note place="margin">Gen. 49. 8. 12.</note> vrge it: and the plainer it is, the better it should haue beene remembred now, and the more readily (on all hands) applyed to such resolution as now we speake of. And seeing that in all ages it was so imbraced of the godly-wise, for a special good prophetical description of the dignity and line of Christ, it might well haue been looked for of those also, so to haue taken their light thereby, on the occasion that now was giuen, as that euen their forme of Gouernment might haue led them from time to time, as it wereby the hand vnto him. That which was but a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of fact a little before, was, that the Tribe of <hi>Iudah</hi> was already appointed to the first place, both for their encamping or pitching of their tents; and for their <note place="margin">Num. 2: 3. Ibid. 10: 14.</note> Marching likewise in their aray: whereby in reason they might be thoght, to bee so well invred to take some state vpon them, that when now it was in plain tearmes appointed vnto them, it should haue beene much better regarded. That neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse they much failed heerein, is made resonable plaine vnto vs by the text it selfe: first in that which we haue not; then, in that which we haue therein. That which wee haue not, is, that we haue no mention made, that eyther the rest of the Tribes did so yeeld themselues vnto <hi>Iudah</hi> (as to such case did appertaine) as vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the death of <hi>Moses</hi> they did vnto <hi>Iosuah</hi> before (at least, those two Tribes and an halfe;) or, that <hi>Iudah</hi> it selfe, or the chiefe of that Tribe, did so take vpon him, <note place="margin">Ios. 1: 16-18.</note> as their Generall, or as the Leader of them all. That which wee haue set downe thereof, is no more in effect but this: that <hi>Iudah</hi> now ioyned with <hi>Simeon,</hi> mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> to helpe each other in their owne peculiar portions; which any other Tribes <note place="margin">Iud 1: 3.</note> might likewise haue done and most likely that so they did. Which kind of dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, being so priuate as it was, is a reasonable good Testimony in it selfe (especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, seeing there is no mention of the other) that they did relinquish the publique, or, not so much as meddle with it. So it seemeth to mee, that according to that Prophecy, of <hi>Iacob,</hi> now did God, hauing already in the Wildernesse set them in some way towardes it, offer the full accomplishment thereof vnto them; and so, that they were no sooner possessed of the land wherein they should dwell, but that <hi>Iudah</hi> was then also appointed to beare that Scepter or State among them: and that they euen all the sort of them, hauing a singular blessing therein offered vnto them, did neuerthelesse depriue themselues of the benefite of it, eyther for that they did not so vnderstand that answer of god (which no doubt, was strange, hauing so good helpes to lead them thereunto as they had;) or else because they were nothing so disposed (neyther <hi>Iudah</hi> to take it vpon them, nor the others to yeeld it vnto them)
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:7530:127"/> and that was stranger. The blessing that I meane was offered vnto them threin, was that better gouernment (both for ciuill order among thē, and for preseruation of Religion) that by likelihood they should this way haue had, in much better measure (God euer blessing his owne ordinance) than afterwardes we finde they had, by such as it pleased God, in default of these, to giue them, beeing also oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times without any at all for a season. Which things will appeare plainely enough in the story it selfe.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Now therefore as touching the latter, that is, what estate it was that so <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> they brought themselues vnto, wee haue the same set downe vnto vs, generally first: more specially after. Generally wee haue set downe, first that the people <note place="margin">Iud. 2: 11-15.</note> by sparing their enemies and by conuersing and matching marriages with them, grew to very grosse Idolatrie, and much prouoking God thereby, were sould ouer into all their enemies handes round about them, to be a spoyle to them at their pleasure: then, that neuerthelesse hee oft-times raised vp Iudges to deliuer them, <note place="margin">Ibid. 16-23.</note> and to helpe them out of the troubles that they had brought themselues into; but that after those Iudges were dead, they quickly returned vnto their former waies againe, and euer grew worse therein than before. A notable patterne in them, of the great corruption and frailty that is in vs. More specially, wee haue the same set <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> downe vnto vs; first, in the body of the Story it selfe that doth go on all the people: then in certaine other particulars that doe touch but certaine of them. In the body of the Story it selfe that dooth goe on the whole people; first, wee haue set downe, what were those Nations that were left among them: then, what were the calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the people, by staining themselues with their infection. The Nations that heere are noted to be left among them, are but such (as it seemeth) as occupied some maine part of the Country, that the Children of <hi>Israell</hi> should haue taken vnto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, but now was still held by these: and not any of those that yet held any Citties or holdes in the seuerall portions of those Tribes wherein they were, against whom they afterward praeuailed, and made them tributaries vnto them. For those that heere are named, are but the fiue <hi>Philistian</hi> Princes, and all the Territories in the <note place="margin">Iud. 3: 1-4.</note> South: and all the North part of the Land, from <hi>Baal-Hermon</hi> in that halfe of the Tribe of <hi>Manasses</hi> which was beyond <hi>Iordan,</hi> and on the East-side of it, vnto <hi>Emath</hi> in the Tribe of <hi>Nepthalim</hi> West-ward, and almost in the vttermost West-part of it, nere vnto <hi>Libanus;</hi> together withall that hilly Countrey of <hi>Libanus</hi> it selfe. For as touching the <hi>Philistims</hi> in the South, they aboad till the time of <hi>Dauid,</hi> and al that <note place="margin">2. Sam. 5: 17.</note> time were mighty till <hi>Dauid</hi> tooke them downe: and, in the North, <hi>Salomon</hi> in his time was faine to craue and vse the helpe of the people there, by <hi>Hiram</hi> their king. <note place="margin">1. King. 5: 6.</note> So that in the daies of these, neyther were those Territories of the <hi>Philistims,</hi> nor these North partes, as yet become the possessions of any of the <hi>Israelites.</hi> The ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities that the people got by stayning themselues with the infection of these, and of such others as they suffered to dwell among them, were all such as people subdued vnto a mightie and grieuous Enemy, vnder those Enemies of theirs, and at their handes are wont to sustaine: though first, not so much to the offence of God, but that he did readily helpe them so soone as euer they sought vnto him; albeit that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they so offended that he would not easily help them. When he did so readily help them, it was the three first times that by their Idolatry they brought themselues into their Enemies hands: first, into the hands of strangers; then, into the hands of the <hi>Canaanites</hi> also in their own land. Those strangers were of two sortes: some of such <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> as haue their Story set down withal; others that haue not. Those that haue their Story set downe withall; were the <hi>Syrians,</hi> and the <hi>Moabites.</hi> The <hi>Syrians</hi> were on the <note place="margin">Iud. 3: 5-8.</note> North of them: and when the people dwelling with these Remnants of the <hi>Canaa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites</hi> so learned their wayes, and betooke themselues vnto them, then the Lorde first deliuered them into the handes of the King of these <hi>Syrians,</hi> who held them in sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection to him eyght yeares. But when they cryed vnto the Lord, then hee stirred vp <hi>Othoniel,</hi> and gaue him so great successe against the <hi>Syrians,</hi> that he deliuered the <note place="margin">Ibid. 9-11.</note> people out of their handes, and gouerned them at home, in peaceable manner, all
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:7530:128"/> the time that hee liued. The <hi>Moabites</hi> dwelt on the South-East corner of them, and at this time was <hi>Eglon</hi> their King, into whose handes, when the Children of <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raell</hi> againe offended, the Lord did deliuer them, so that they were in subiection to <note place="margin">Ibid. 12-14. Ibid. 15-30.</note> him eighteene yeares. But when the people cryed to the Lord, he stirred vp <hi>Ehud,</hi> who killed the King, gathered the people together, went against the <hi>Moabites,</hi> prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed against them, slew ten thousand of them, and so deliuered the Children of <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raell</hi> from their subiection. In whose Story one thing in particular is, that when <note place="margin">Ibid. 20.</note> comming in to the King, he told him he had a message vnto him from God, the king then arose out of his Throne, in dutifull reuerence, to giue eare vnto it: an example of an Heathen man, &amp; an Enemy vnto the people of God, hard to be matched among the Christians now, withall the greater sort in a manner, though very farre inferior to him. Those that haue not their Story set downe withall, were the <hi>Philistims,</hi> who, in what sort, or how long they vexed the people, or had them vnder, we cannot tell: but it is said, that <hi>Samgar</hi> slew sixe hundred of them with a Goad, and deliuered <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raell;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ibid. 31. Ibid. 5: 6.</note> and that in his daies it was so dangerous for the people to traiuaile (because of their Enemies) that the High-waies lay vnoccupyed among them. Againe it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth <hi>Samgar</hi> was but of very short time, because where he is set downe to be next <note place="margin">Ibid. 3: 31.</note> after <hi>Ehud,</hi> in the next verse after hee is in a manner omitted: beeing there said, that the people began againe to doe wickedly; and the same beeing said to bee after the <note place="margin">Iud. 4: 1.</note> death, not of <hi>Samgar</hi> who succeeded, but of <hi>Ehud</hi> that went before. Into the handes of the <hi>Cannanites</hi> they were deliuered, when next they sinned against God, <note place="margin">Iud. 4: 1-3.</note> who now (by their sparing of them) were growne so strong, that they had nine hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Charets of Iron (whom might they thanke for the same, but themselues?) And verysore vexed them twenty yeares. But when they cryed vnto the Lord, it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> God to stirre vp <hi>Deborah,</hi> a Woman, who sending for <hi>Barak</hi> from out of the <note place="margin">Ibid. 4-9.</note> Tribe of <hi>Nepthalim</hi> (euen from those boarders, where the <hi>Canaanites</hi> were growne so strong now) appointed him to be the Generall of the fielde, or Leader of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple for that praesent, and told him withall, that it was of God, and how he should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haue himselfe therein. So he, according to her direction from the Lord, gathered <note place="margin">Ibid. 10-23.</note> out of the Tribes of <hi>Zabulon</hi> and <hi>Nepthalim,</hi> next adioyning vnto the Enemy, ten thousand men to come vnto him to <hi>Kedes</hi> in the face of the Enemy. But from thence, as he was directed, hee drew backe to Mount <hi>Thabor,</hi> in the South-edge of <hi>Zabulon,</hi> and neere vnto the Riuer <hi>Kison</hi> (the bounder betwixt <hi>Issakar</hi> and <hi>Zabulon,</hi> from the Sea of <hi>Galile</hi> on the East, to the maine Sea on the West) whither <hi>Deborah</hi> told him, that the Lorde would drawe their Enemies, led by <hi>Sisera Iabins</hi> Generall. <hi>Sisera</hi> therefore following after thither, had there a great ouerthrow, and himselfe was slaine by the way as he fled. Whereupon <hi>Deborah</hi> and <hi>Barak</hi> gaue thankes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <note place="margin">Ibid. 5: 1-31.</note> God: and the people of <hi>Israell</hi> hence-forward praeuailed more and more against <hi>Iab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

When hee did but reprooue them, it was, when for <note place="margin">Iud. 6: 1-10.</note> their reuolting againe, he had brought the <hi>Madianites</hi> on them: who, taking vnto them the <hi>Amalakites,</hi> and others besides, came in great multitudes into the Land, yearely eating vp (with their Cattle, that they to that purpose brought with them) the encrease of the earth from the Children of <hi>Israel,</hi> and euer spoyling them of theyr Cattle besides; being so many, and of such force and strength, that the <hi>Israelites</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing no hope to doe any good by encountering with them, made themselues Dens and Caues in the Mountaines, wherein they might hide themselues from them, and fled into them. A very heauy and pittifull sight, that the people of God, should now be so greatly distressed by forraine power, and yet haue neither force nor heartes to stand against them, but faine so basely to runne into holes, to hide themselues from sight of the Enemy. But such are the miserable fruites of sinne. So when they sought vnto the Lord, they got naught but a iust reproofe. Neuerthelesse hee did <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> set in hand immediatly after with their deliuerance, and shortly after that performed
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:7530:128"/> the same. In which deliuerance of theirs, wee are to consider; first, of this deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance it selfe: then, of certaine particulars therein. This deliuerance it selfe was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry miraculous, altogether shewing that it was not obtained by force of Man, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the extraordinary power of God: and yet, a speciall scourge withall to diuers of them. Miraculous it was, both in <hi>Gideons</hi> calling vnto it: and in the manner of gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the victory.

The manner of giuing the victory was miraculous also, both in the choyce, and vse of those few Men: and, that they were no otherwise furnished. For they were but three hundred in all, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished but with a toy to speake of: and yet notwithstanding, euen by it onely in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, was, that great company discouraged and broken; and by weake and small for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces immediatly after, were two of their Princes, and two of their Kinges, taken and <note place="margin">Ibid 7: 23-25. 8: 4-12, 18-21.</note> staine, and all their forces discomforted and destroyed. That as these aboue others, had taken a wicked and mercilesse way to distresse the people of God, and had there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by distressed them more than other before: so might their ouerthrow be so much the more steeped in lishonour and blood, and laid open to the reproach and derision of all. A scourge it was, both praesently after this his victory: and after that himselfe was deceased. Immediatly after this victory, this raising of <hi>Gideon</hi> was a scourge vnto the people of <hi>Succoth</hi> and <hi>Pennell,</hi> who conceiuing it to bee a matter vnlikely <note place="margin">Iud. 8: 5-9, 13 17.</note> for him to praeuaile against those he pursued, denyed to giue them any releefe, but for the same were sharply punished at his returne.

Of those particulars that I wish to bee considered also, some went before the victory a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaide: and some did follow. Of those that went before, some concerne <hi>Gedeon</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> himselfe: others, the Souldiers that he brought with him. In <hi>Gedeon</hi> himselfe wee haue two thinges to bee noted: how hee must begin; and, what weakenesse was in him. He must begin with the ouerthrow of the Idoll there: wherein also is to bee <note place="margin">Iud. 6: 25-27.</note> noted, that to plead for that Idoll, was by <hi>Ioash</hi> accounted worthy of death: as there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by shewing, that they accounted so basely of him, as not able to helpe himselfe. That <note place="margin">Ibid. 28-32. Ibid. 36-40. 7: 9-14. Ibid. 6: 12.</note> there was great weaknesse in him, it is plaine by the tokens hee required, and by that farther supply that God gaue him out of that Dreame: and yet is he saluted by God himselfe a little before, as a man of speciall valour. A very good example to shew, that these two may lodge together; great magnanimitie, &amp; great weakenesse too: and that magnanimity not onely that is of Flesh and Blood (for it is not likely, that God would vouchsafe it such commendation) but euen that also, that is of Gods holy spirit; that being the speciall guift of God, and the weaknesse that lurketh with it, our owne corruption. Those that concerne the Souldiers he brought with him, are two: one, that such as were afraide of the euent of battaile, or to put themselues in <note place="margin">Iud. 7: 2, 3.</note> hazzard, had liberty giuen them to repaire home againe; the other, that when there was but few left, yet God himselfe caused the greedier sort of them also be dismissed, <note place="margin">Ibid. 4-7.</note> to the sending away of nine thousand and seauen hundred, and leauing but three hundred onely. A sufficient warning to vs, that as it is to little purpose to haue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies or ranckes neuer so well stuffed of men, vnlesse their hearts also bee such, as the action requireth: and that such as are greedily minded, and so either impatient of hunger and thirst, or bent on the spoyle, are like also to doe but little good ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice. Of those that did follow the victory, some did follow immediatly after: others, not till a good time betwixt. Those that followed immediatly after were two: one, of <hi>Ephraim;</hi> the other of <hi>Gedeon.</hi> That of <hi>Ephraim</hi> was, that they were so quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relling <note place="margin">Ibid. 8: 1.</note> with him, when they saw he had sped so well, that hee had not called them vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it before: they beeing so neere vnto that whole businesse, euen in the heart of all <gap reason="missing" extent="1+ pages">

               <pb n="236" facs="tcp:7530:129"/> to see, how they prouoked God to displeasure: then, how he thereupon dealt with them. They prouoked God to displeasure, as before, by leauing to serue him, and giuing themselues to much Idolatry: of which kinde there is more reckoning heere, than in any of the others before, and, in a maner, euen all the Idols round about them. Of which because it is so plainely set downe, that they serued those, and forsooke the <note place="margin">Iud. 10: 6</note> Lord and serued not him: it is good for vs also to marke, that howsoeuer we may be perswaded, that we may serue the Lord and others too, or that the true worship of God and the worship of the later-found-Images may stand together; yet in truth they doe so badly agree, that we can neuer take them together. His manner of dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with them hereupon was, that first he shewed himselfe offended with them: but yet after tooke compassion on them. He shewed himselfe offended with them, first by giuing them into their enemies hands: then, by refusing to helpe them, when they sought vnto him. The enemies into whose hands it pleased God to deliuer them now, were two nations adioyning vnto them: the <hi>Philistims</hi> on the South-west, in <note place="margin">Ibid. 7.</note> part of the Land which should haue beene theirs; and the <hi>Ammonites,</hi> out of the proper bounds of their Land, on the North-East. Of the <hi>Philistims</hi> wee haue no Story heere; and therefore doe some make the bondage of the people vnder the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>listims,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Tremel. &amp; Ion. in Iud.</hi> 10: 7.</note> to concurre with that vnder the <hi>Ammonites:</hi> as though, when the <hi>Ammo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites</hi> afflicted them one the East, at that time also did the <hi>Philistims</hi> preuaile against <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> them on the West. Which also is the reason, why they set the childrens of <hi>Israels</hi> subiection vnder the <hi>Philistims</hi> (for that space of forty yeares that after is spoken of) to beginne before the time of <hi>Iephthe,</hi> as we saw before. But we haue diuers things <note place="margin">Iud. 13: 1.</note> mentioned in the Scriptures, of which we haue in particular no Originall Story: as we haue of the selfe-same <hi>Philistims</hi> a little before, a manifest token that in <hi>Samgars</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iud. 3: 31.</note> time they were grieuous to the people of God; and yet haue we no Story of them, but that <hi>Samgar</hi> slew sixe hundred of them with nothing else but onely a Goad. As also we haue mention of a former deliuerance out of the hands of the <hi>Philistims,</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after: and yet haue we no Story of it, vnlesse it be that of <hi>Samgers</hi> time. <note place="margin">Iud. 10: 11.</note> So it is not to be doubted, but that now also the <hi>Philistims</hi> were very troublesome and grieuous vnto them: and yet we finde not, that this was any part of the forty yeeres that are mentioned after. And seeing it is so plainely set downe, that the Land of the <hi>Philistims</hi> should also appertaine to the children of <hi>Israel,</hi> we may easily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, that the <hi>Philistims</hi> would euer on all occasions, seeke to molest and suppresse <note place="margin">Ios 13: 2. Iud. 3: 3.</note> them, that so themselues might euer inioy their owne seats the better. But of the <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monites</hi> we haue the Story in particular deliuered vnto vs, how, &amp; in what maner they were grieuous to the people of God; as namely, that they did oppresse and vexe them eighteene yeeres: first, but on the other side of <hi>Iordan</hi> onely; but then after, on this <note place="margin">Iud. 10: 8, 9.</note> side also, and therein the chiefe of them all. By whom they were so very sore vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that in the end they sought the Lord: at which time though he refused now to <note place="margin">Ibid. 10.</note> helpe them; yet shortly after he tooke such compassion vpon them, that neuerthelesse in the ende they were holpen. In this refusing to helpe them now, hee did both tell <note place="margin">Ibid. 11-14.</note> them the reason of it, for that hee had so oft deliuered them before, and yet was so little regarded by them: and willed them also to goe seeke for helpe at the hands of those Gods whom they had chosen. But yet when they did seeke the Lord still, and put away the strange Gods from among them, and serued the Lord, then the <note place="margin">Ibid. 15, 16.</note> Lord had compassion on their misery: and shortly after (though himselfe would not bee seene in the ordaining or choice of the party, whom notwithstanding he prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red) <note place="margin">Iud. 11: 29, 32</note> they had by <hi>Iephthe</hi> a good deliuerance. Concerning whom wee haue more especially deliuered vnto vs, in what sort he was taken to that charge: and, how hee acquirred himselfe therein. He was taken vnto that charge, first but by some part of the people: but afterward, as it seemeth, by all. That part of the people that made the first choice of him, were the <hi>Gileadites</hi> that dwelt on the East-side of <hi>Ior<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan:</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> and in that part of his calling vnto that place, wee haue declared, what might seeme to mooue them to make choyce of him; and on what condition hee yeelded vnto them.

               </note> that Coast, but a little within the Land it selfe) they might well feare, that hee would ioyne with their Enemies against them, if they did not giue him some satisfaction or contentment for their discourtisies doone vnto him. Which also may seeme to be their meaning, when as, he expostulating that former dealing of theirs against him, they answere againe, that <hi>therefore</hi> they came in vnto him now, to seek his sauour to <note place="margin">Iud. 11: 4-8.</note> be their Generall and Leader against the <hi>Ammonites,</hi> and to be their Gouernor too. The conditions whereon he would condescend vnto them, and which they as readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">Ibid. 9. 10.</note> accepted, was, that if hee praeuailed against the <hi>Ammonites,</hi> and came home safe, then, from that time forward should hee be their Gouernour. This being done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <note place="margin">Ibid. 11.</note> him and the Elders of <hi>Gilead,</hi> it seemeth, that after they went to the rest of the people on the West-side of <hi>Iordan,</hi> and there transacted with them likewise on the same condition: and for the better dispatch of the matter, did it at <hi>Mizpah</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord, there also reciting the couenant betwixt them.

               </gap>e, that <hi>Iephthe</hi> dwelt, when he iudged <hi>Israell</hi> sixe yeares: a thing indeed most likely, because the <hi>Ammonites</hi> in his time (the <hi>Philistims</hi> before beeing set by for a while) were the most dangerous Enemies vnto the <hi>Israelites,</hi> and that Cittie was in the Frontiers of the Land of <hi>Gilead</hi> towardes the <hi>Ammonites,</hi> and so the meetest for him to make the place of his most aboad. But in this wee doe not read, that the Tabernacle was at <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> any time placed; neyther was it meete for such purpose, being, as it was, in the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side of the Land: and <hi>Phinehas,</hi> together with those other ten, which were sent to <note place="margin">Ios. 22: 19.</note> the two Tribes and a halfe about their new erected Altar, doe so appropriat the west part of the Land (wherein most of them dwelt) to bee the seate for the Tabernacle, that (since they came ouer <hi>Iordan)</hi> they deny the place thereof to bee in the East. And whereas <hi>Samuell</hi> afterward assembled the people to <hi>Mizpeh,</hi> and their prayed <note place="margin">1. Sam. 7: 5. 11.</note> for them against the <hi>Philistims</hi> (comming in with their forces against them, to sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize them there) and so had a fair day against thē: both the neernesse of that place vnto the <hi>Philistims,</hi> and <hi>Eben-ezer</hi> the bounder stone shewing how farre the Lorde <note place="margin">Ibid. 12. <hi>Chr.

To see how hee acquitted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe of the charge that now he had taken vpon him, wee are to know, that most part of it, is of martiall affaires: but some part of it, of peaceable also. Of his martiall affaires, one onely peece of seruice it was that was intended: but another there was that on the suddaine brake foorth besides. That which was intended, was to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse the force of the <hi>Ammonites:</hi> which that he may the better doe, first hee assay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth what he can doe by faire meanes onely; and, when so he can doe nothing, rhen hee addresseth himselfe to the battaile. The faire meanes that hee vsed, were, first, that he sent to the King of the <hi>Ammonites,</hi> to know what cause he had so to come in <note place="margin">Iud. 11: 12.</note> hostile manner into his Countrey, then, when he vnderstood what cause he praeten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, hee sendeth vnto him againe to let him vnderstand, and to make it plaine vnto <note place="margin">Ibid. 13-27.</note> him, that in that praetence of his, he had no iust cause to mooue warre against him; and therein appealeth to God. When this would take no place with the King of <hi>Ammon,</hi> but that he was faine (for his iust defence) to praepare himselfe vnto battle, <note place="margin">Ibid. 28.</note> we haue likewise deliuered, how he addresseth himselfe vnto it: and how hee perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth the action it selfe. In addressing himselfe vnto it, he did something well: and something ill. That which hee did well, was, that hee went vnto it with courage; and withall as it seemeth, was carefull to take those forces of his with him, that were <note place="margin">Ibid. 29.</note>
               <pb n="238" facs="tcp:7530:130"/> next adioyning vnto the Enemy: matters that are vsually subiect to the naturall man, and such as the naturall man can readily deale with; sauing that we else-where vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, <note place="margin">Heb. 11: 32, 33.</note> that he had Faith in some measure mingled withall. That which hee did ill, was a matter of higher consideration: such as the naturall man can neuer behaue himselfe in as he ought; but euer is wrong, one way or other. Hee knew, that the High power of all was in such case to be sought vnto; and so to be dealt with, as that he would prosper the action: and this might he know, onely as a meere naturall man. But in what sort that was rightly to be done, of that he sheweth himselfe very igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
               <note place="margin">Ibid. 30, 31.</note> and so doth ghesse accordingly at it. The action it selfe was not onely his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countering with the <hi>Ammonites</hi> now: but by his owne vnaduised dealing, it had an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other appendant vnto it, and the same, as it seemeth, very pittifull also. As for his encountering with the <hi>Ammonites,</hi> God did so prosper him therein, that he praeuailed <note place="margin">Ibid. 32, 33.</note> much against them, and brought them so low, that now the Children of <hi>Israell</hi> were safe enough from them. What that other appendant was, the learned themselues are not yet agreed: most of them taking it, that it was the sacrificing of his owne Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; others (of late) that it was but vowing her vnto virginitie.

For the great sorrow that the Father conceiued vpon the first sight of his Daughter, remembring then what hee had vowed vnto the Lorde, and his wordes sutable thereunto; that speciall request of the Daughter, for so long a time, for her selfe and for her fellowes to goe and bewaile (and that in the Mountaines, as a thing <note place="margin">Ibid. 37. Ibid. 38.</note> forlorne) her case in that matter; that she and her fellowes so did indeed; and that it grew to a custome in <hi>Israell</hi> (not onely of his owne house, or of the Tribe whereof <note place="margin">Ibid. 39, 40</note> he was) that the Daughters of <hi>Israell</hi> (as afore) did yearely lament, for foure dayes space, the case of that Virgine: all these I say, and euery of them doe seeme vnto mee to boad a matter of greater sorrow, than her perpetuall virginity, or, for all her life to be a <hi>Nazarite</hi> to God, could be vnto any of all the company. Againe, that request of hers of bewailing her virginity first, seemeth rather to import, that it was somewhat else that she conceiued should be inflicted on her, than perpetuall virgini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: for that if it had beene naught else but it, she needed not to haue taken time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore but might easily haue seene, that to such purpose shee had time enough after.

Neither is it doubted of <hi>Iudas,</hi> but that so long as he kept his place with the rest, he did such workes of Faith as the rest did, preaching Christ, and doing great workes, when they were sent out to doe that seruice: as also it is certaine, that Saint <hi>Peter</hi> had faith, though he would haue stayed Christ from his <note place="margin">Mat. 10: 1.

They did much prouoke him vnto it, in abusing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues so much as they did, both to his owne person, and to his company. On his owne person they were not ashamed to lay their reproofe: and then added threate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings besides. Their reproofe likewise they did not onely lay vpon him at the first: but afterward also, when he excused himselfe vnto them, yet did they not accept of his answere. Their reproofe was, that he did not call vpon them when hee went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <note place="margin">Iud. 12: 1.</note> the <hi>Ammonites,</hi> as they had quarrelled with <hi>Gedeon</hi> before, for not calling them against the <hi>Midianites.</hi> Whereunto <hi>Iepthe</hi> answered, that hee had called on <note place="margin">Ibid. 2. 3.</note> them, but they came not; and so was he faine himselfe to deale with them so well as he could: therefore that they had no cause, thus to come foorth in hostile manner a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> him as they did.

For the <hi>Gileadites,</hi> beeing so netled with them, as before they were, not contented to giue them the ouer-throw in the fielde, intercepted from them the passages of <hi>Iordan</hi> besides, and there likewise put to the Sword so many of that side as they found to bee <hi>Ephramites</hi> indeede: so that there fell that day, of that company onely, to the number of two and forty thousand. A faire warning to all, not to stand so much in conceit with our selues, as that wee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not well abide that others haue good atchiuements besides vs; especially if they bee our Inferiors: at least, that wee doe not quarrell with them, nor vse any reproach to their persons. <hi>Gedeon</hi> had put vp such a matter at their handes more quietly before: but men may not looke, in any such case, to bee spared still; but that one time or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">Ibid. 8: 1-3.</note> they will bee remembred, if they take not vp the sooner. That part of his charge which was more peaceable, was his gouernment all his time after: of which we haue neither good nor ill; but onely that it was sixe yeares in all. Comming to that other, wherein it pleased God to praeuent them, heere againe wee haue some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther going betwixt: then, the Story it selfe that wee speake of. Those others that goe betwixt, are of three seuerall Gouernours that were next <hi>Iephthe, Ibzan, Elon,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iud. 12: 8-15.</note> and <hi>Abdon:</hi> they iudging <hi>Israell</hi> euery one his time, the first seauen yeares; the next ten; and the third, eyght. Of whom wee haue nothing else recorded; sauing that two of them did much braue it: the first of them, in Sonnes and Daughters; and the last, in Sonnes and Nephewes. But so it is the manner of many to gouerne, that besides their effeminatenesse, and Peacocks-taile, there is nothing worthy of memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in them: and those thinges not worthy neither, but of most silent and darke obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uion. Neuerthelesse, euen this their brauing is great probability, that those fortie yeares of the <hi>Philistims</hi> oppression of the people, were none of these, as we saw be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that some did reckon: because it is not likely, that these could haue borne their heades so high, if the <hi>Philistims</hi> were then Lordes ouer them; the one of them, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to haue his seat but in <hi>Bethlehem</hi> in <hi>Iudah,</hi> and the farther of them, but in <hi>Ephra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im,</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> both of them neere vnto the <hi>Philistims.</hi> The Story it selfe that now we speak of, is how it pleased God to deale with his people, when now again they did offend him: and, so first of the peoples offending; then of Gods dealing with them. As tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the peoples offending, heere wee reade, that againe they behaued themselues
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:7530:131"/> wickedly towardes God, and at this time so continued in that their wickednesse very long: at least, that we reade of no repentance in them vntill the time of <hi>Samuell</hi> the Prophet. And a perrilous thing it is, when at any time wee haue professed repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and to abandon the sinnes we are in, yet after to returne vnto them againe. For so commeth it to passe oft-times, that thence-forward wee settle our selues therein, without remorse or feeling of them. The dealing that God had with them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, was some part of it appertaining vnto their chasticement for the same: and some part againe, to his gracious fauour. For their chasticement he deliuered them ouer into the handes of the <hi>Philistims</hi> for the space of forty yeares. Concerning which, <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> there is some quaestion made by the learned, at what time those forty yeares should bee: one beeing of opinion, that it is vncertaine, where to place them; or to finde, <note place="margin">

But then there bee two doubts which may easily bee conceiued heere: one, of that which is saide of <hi>Sampson;</hi> the other, of that which is saide of <hi>Elie.</hi> That which is of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="L"/>
               <note place="margin">Iud. 15: 20-16: 31.</note>
               <hi>Sampson,</hi> is that he Iudged <hi>Israel</hi> twentie yeares: and that those yeares were in the
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:7530:131"/> dayes of the <hi>Philistims.</hi> And the doubt that is of this matter, is, that if the oppression of the people by the <hi>Philistims</hi> should be allotted to the time of <hi>Elie</hi> (which being for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty yeares also, would take vp, the whole time of the <hi>Philistims):</hi> then, how could <hi>Sampsons</hi> twenty yeares, be saide to be in the <hi>Philistims</hi> dayes? To this I can say no more but thus, that as the <hi>Philistims,</hi> it appeareth, were busie before in the dayes of <hi>Samgar</hi> and <hi>Iephthe,</hi> and before that <hi>Sampson</hi> was yet borne: so not vnlikely, but that <note place="margin">Iud. 3: 31. 10: 7. 13: 15.</note> now also they were a good while brogging about it, before they could so fully-pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile against them, as to haue them in subiection vnto them. In which meane time it seemeth that <hi>Sampson</hi> was a let vnto them, and there had his twenty yeares. Which notwithstanding, I grant, is not vnlikely, to be so meanely accomplished by him, that it <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Tremel. Iun. in</hi> Iud. 12▪ 7, 8, 9, 11, 13.</note> is lesse maruell that others, out of the selfe same word in the Original, that themselues still interpreted to Iudge <hi>Israel</hi> before, when they come vnto him, can finde no more in it, but that he auenged some wrongs that were done them. That which is of <hi>Elie</hi> is, that if the <hi>Philistims</hi> in all his time had the children of <hi>Israel</hi> in subiection vnto <note place="margin">Ibid. 15: 20. 16: 31. Iud 4: 18.</note> them, how then may <hi>Elie</hi> be saide, all those forty yeares of his to haue Iudged the people of <hi>Israel.</hi> To which I know no more to be saide neither, but onely this, that he being but the High-Priest, it is not vnlikely, but that the <hi>Philistims</hi> might tollerate him to Iudge the people in such matters as concerned their Lawes, and inferiour matters of Ciuill Gouernment also, thereby to keepe them more easily, in subiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vnto them: as <hi>Alexander,</hi> for his time afterward did; and after him, the <hi>Romans</hi> likewise. In gracious fauour he gaue vnto them some little helpe and hope in the meane season (and that without any seeking vnto him on their part for it): and then after, a farther deliuerance. The helpe and hope that in the meane season he gaue them, was by <hi>Sampson,</hi> who forgat himselfe so much in that his dutie, that hee did them but little good: and yet was, in diuers things, a figure of Christ. So are wee first to consider of him as the Story goeth of himselfe: then, as hee was a figure of Christ. As the Story goeth of himselfe we are to consider, first how farre it may <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="M"/> seeme, that he was called to be some speciall helpe vnto them: then, how farre it may likewise seeme, that he did forget himselfe therein. It may seeme he was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to be some speciall helpe vnto them, first by such dealing as the Lord had with his Parants before: then, by such as he had with himselfe after. His dealing with his Parents before was such, as that (by all likelyhood) they had fully acquainted him therewith: both for the substance; and manner of it. The substance of it was, but to signifie vnto them, what a childe they should haue: and how farre the Mother was to forbeare her owne freedome in some few things (otherwise lawfull) in the meane season. The child they should haue, hee gaue them to vnderstand, should be a <hi>Nazarite</hi> vnto the Lord from his birth: and should beginne to saue <note place="margin">Ibid. 13: 5.</note>
               <hi>Israel</hi> out of the hands of the <hi>Philistims.</hi> The Mother was now thenceforward (vntill she should be diliuered of him) to forbeare to eate any thing that grew on the Vine; and euery vncleane thing whatsoeuer: and to drinke no Wine, nor <note place="margin">Ibid. 3. 4, 12-14. Ibid. 2-5. Ibid. 4-14.</note> strong drinke. The manner of it was such likewise, as might helpe well to confirme him in it both because it was twice deliuered vnto them: and because therein they were vsed with so great fauor besides. It was first deliuered vnto the wife alone: but then, she telling her Husband of it, and he desiring the Lord, that he would vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safe them some farther direction how to vse the child when they had him; by that occasion, the Angell appearing to the woman againe in the field, and she running for her Husband, he told the Husband the same againe, but in one point a little more fully. The fauourable dealing that was vsed therein besides, was so much the greater, if it were the Lord indeed that so appeared vnto him, as some doe take <note place="margin">Tre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="242" facs="tcp:7530:132"/> that to them was vsed. One thing also there is, that, if he were but an Angel, may very well put vs in mind, and gather vs to some consideration of the great ods, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="N"/> is betwixt those Coelestiall, and these Terrestrial bodies here; namely, that when <note place="margin">Ibid▪ 17, 18.</note>

The dealing that God had with him after, was altogether gracious al his life long to speake of: at the first (in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede) none other then might wel be expected vpon those promises made before; but afterward exceeding al expectation. That which was none other than might well be expected vpon the promised before made, was, that God did blesse him in his childhood in such sort, that thence hee grew vnto very great and incredible strength: yea and to an Heroycall minde also, as some doe take it; but my selfe doe <note place="margin">Ibid. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>. In Iud.</hi> 13: 24.</note> not see, how the same may be soundly gathered. That fauour of God towards him afterward, which exceeded al expectation, was, as it seemeth vnto me, of two kinds: one, to call him to better wayes, and more agreeable to his vocation, than such as he tooke; the other, that he did so graciously preserue and assist him, in those mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner wayes that himselfe did rather chuse. Of the former sort, one there is, that, as I take it, may best be thought to be of that kind, though we haue no expresse warant so to take it: and one other besides, that is more expresly warranted to bee one of that sort indeede. That which seemeth to bee of that nature, as that so it might best bee taken, though wee haue no expresse warrant for it, is of the Lyon that met him out of the Vineyards roaring vpon him, as hee was <note place="margin">Iud. 14: 5, 6.</note> going downe to <hi>Timnah</hi> to match himselfe with a <hi>Philistim</hi> there: which the Lord at that time gaue into his hands. Concerning which, there is one thing, I graunt, that seemeth to crosse directly the sense wherein I do take it: and therefore are we first to see, what that sense is; thē, what may be said vnto that which seme to crosse it. The sense that I speake of, is, that because God did so directly forbid all the people <note place="margin">Exod. 34: 12. Deut. 7: 3.</note> to make any marriages with the people of that land, &amp; had chosen this man to be of so special regard vnto him; he therfore did not well, now to make his match there: &amp; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="O"/>
               <note place="margin">Iud. 13: 5.</note> that therfore the Lord sent the Lion as his Messenger, to challenge him as it were for his prey; and yet that he gaue him into his hands, that he being praeserued from him, might afterward take some better course. As before that time God himselfe both came roughly vpon <hi>Moses</hi> as though he would haue killed him, because there was a <note place="margin">Exod. 4▪ 14.</note> fault in him: and yet meaning to haue his seruice, did him no hurt in the end. That which doth seeme to crosse it, is, that it is ascribed vnto the Lord, that hee was so wedded to match there, so to seeke occasion against the <hi>Philistims.</hi> But it is suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently <note place="margin">Iud. 14: 4.</note> knowne, that God may well vse the inordinate waies of men, to execute his iudgementes: and yet not approue them to those that do them. God may well <note place="margin">1 King 22: 22. Iob. 1. 16. Hab. 2. 13.</note> vse the greatest sinnes that are committed (and in that sense may they also be said to be of the Lord) and yet hath no man excuse with God, but onely in following the rule praescribed. That which is more expresly warranted to be one of that sort in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, is that his dealing with the <hi>Philistims</hi> in <hi>Ramath-Lechi,</hi> where hee slue a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand of them with the Iaw-bone of an Asse. The story is, that being prouoked by <note place="margin">Iud. 15: 15.</note> the <hi>Philistims</hi> before, hee had without any weapon at all mightily praeuailed against many of them, by Horse-play onely (as we tearme it) euen with his soote: and then <note place="margin">Ibid. 6 8.</note> went to the West parts of <hi>Iudah,</hi> hauing there a Rocke and a Caue for his defence <note place="margin">

The <hi>Philistims</hi> followed with great forces to <hi>Lechi</hi> and there pitched, somewhat short of the place whether <hi>Sam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> was gon.

The reason why I take this to be of that sort, rather than the rest, is chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Text: and partly one coniecture besides, that, by circumstance of the time, sec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to lead to that sense also. The Text is, that immediately before shewing that <note place="margin">Ibid. 13: 24.

The circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of time that I speake of, is, that when he had runne a good peece of his course now, as it seemeth (this being one halfe of his story) and done so little good in his chiefe and principall businesse, that the <hi>Philistims</hi> were yet rulers ouer them: heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it seemeth (by such other workes of God of like nature, as by the Angels mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <note place="margin">Ibid. 15: 11.

It may seeme likewise that <hi>Sampson</hi> did much forget himselfe in this his cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling; first, if we consider of his Story but generally: then, much more if wee enter into particulars. If we consider of it but generally, we are diuen to vnderstand twice, <note place="margin">Iud. 15: 20. 16: 31.</note> that hee iudged <hi>Israel</hi> twenty yeares: or at least, as I noted before, that some did read, so long auenged them of their enemies. But what haue wee in all his Storie, that may in any good measure import eyther of these: at least the former, which is the thing that the Text doth most require? So it seemeth, that because he was a Man of so rare a strength, and a professed <hi>Nazarite</hi> withall, many repaired vnto him, had many of their causes decided by him, and were euer in hope of some speciall deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance dy his handes to be obtained. But that he did any thing worthy of memorie of that kinde, that wee finde not: and yet is it likely, that such thinges would haue
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:7530:133"/> beene remembred if any such there had beene, altogether as soone as most of those that we haue recorded of him. That God did make him such an Instrument of his, in many of those his actions to shewe foorth his displeasure and power against the enemy; which also himselfe could, neuer haue attempted onely by his owne force <note place="margin">Ibid. 16: 17.</note> (were it neuer so great) against so many, but onely by Faith in GOD withall; in that also hee outwardly bare that testification of his profession towardes God; <note place="margin">Ibid. 15: 18. 16: 28.</note> and in that, in his necessitie hee could so readily seeke vnto GOD, both in his life, and at his death: all these are very good tokens, that much was in him; but yet exceeding pittifully ouer-layd by his owne infirmitie, euen as a little fire raked vp in a great heape of Ashes. If we goe to particulars, when do we finde, that he blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Trumpet, encourageth his people, stoppeth the wayes, layeth his Garrisons, or any such like, as the case of the people did then require, and is vsually doone by such as professe themselues to be their Leaders against their Enemies? Or when doth hee hold any assemblies for Execution of Iustice among them: or but to call vppon them in some good time to seeke the Lord, that he may bring downe their Enemies before them? In stead of these and such like, what else doe we finde, but that hee gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth <note place="margin">Ind. 14: 1-5, 7, 17. 15: 1-8. 16: 1, 4.</note> himselfe most vnto Women (and that, not in any honourable manner, but base<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="R"/> rather) and to such priuate quarrels and reuenges as by them he entangled himselfe withall, sometimes performed as basely too? As, when his Wife was giuen to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <note place="margin">Ibid. 15: 1-5.</note> because hee left her before in displeasure, besides that it was nothing heroicall, nor so beseeming one that was of such force, to deale by such wiles, by so many fires to make so great destruction of the <hi>Philistims</hi> Corne, how vnaduisedly also may it be conceiued the same was doone, in respect of his owne people the <hi>Israelites?</hi> For it <note place="margin">Ibid 14: 4. Ibid. 15: 11.</note> goeth a little before, that at that time the <hi>Philistims</hi> raigned ouer <hi>Israel:</hi> and it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth a little after, knowest thou not, said the people of <hi>Iudah,</hi> when they came to binde him, and to make deliuery of him, that the <hi>Philistims</hi> are Rulers ouer vs? As also wee may assure our selues, that the Tribe of <hi>Iudah</hi> would not haue yeelded to haue deliuered him into their handes, as they did, vnlesse they had beene strongly ouermatched with them indeed. Then being so that the <hi>Philistims</hi> had <hi>Israell</hi> in such <note place="margin">Ibid. 12, 13.</note> subiection, could hee so destroy the <hi>Philistims</hi> Corne, but that the <hi>Israelites</hi> must needes make vp that want with theirs? Now in that inordinate lust of his vnto Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, doe we finde, that at any time he tooke vp and left them? Or may wee not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doubt, that seeing he was so much besotted with them as we finde that hee was, both in vttering to one the secret of his parable to his owne dishonour and losse, and especially in vttering to another of them wherein his strength lay, to his owne vtter ouerthrow (and that when hee had so often found before, that her meaning was to betray him into his enemies hands) may wee not (I say) rather doubt, that, seeing by occasion hereof he did so much neglect his calling, and would not take any warning before, therefore God himselfe also did now take no pleasure in him, and woulde no longer worke by him, and so gaue him vp to so dishonourable and great a ruine? A very good patterne to all that are called to any speciall seruice: either in some good measure to performe it indeede, or else to looke for none other at the hands of God, but to be swept out as the dust of the Floower, with as great reproach, as euer they were taken in vnto it with honour. But he at the best, was but a figure: and meet it was wee should haue no full contentment in him; that so more readily wee might passe ouer vnto the other, whose figure he was, and to seeke it onely in him. Now therfore as he was a figure of Christ, there be diuers things in this his Story, that we <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="S"/> may apply to our comfort: one, who that stood with him all his whole life; others, no more but certaine of his particular actions. That one that stood with him all <note place="margin">Iud. 13: 5.</note> his whole life, was, that God had appointed (before he was borne) that hee should be a <hi>Nazarite</hi> to him, euen from his birth, and so to stand (as his Mother acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged) <note place="margin">Ibid. 7.</note> to the day of his death: that is, that in very speciall manner hee should euer bee separate from the world vnto God; and euer beare with him in the haire of his head, some open testification of it. The vowe of the <hi>Nazarite</hi> wee saw before: that was but for a time, at the parties owne election; but yet for the time it made them like bright Starres among men, glorious in themselues, and good examples vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:7530:133"/> others. But this being for all his life, had he rightly performed the same, it had beene exceeding glorious to himselfe: and a great condemnation to the loosenesse of others. And then, though the Lord did in plaine tearmes promise no more, but <note place="margin">Ibid 5.</note> onely that he should begin to saue <hi>Israell</hi> out of the handes of the <hi>Philistims:</hi> yet it is not to say what wonderfull deliuerance, God by his handes, was like enough to haue giuen vnto them. For that subiection of theirs vnder the <hi>Philistims</hi> being but a figure or shaddow of a greater subiection, that both they and we were in vnder sin, and the cursse of the Law for the same, from which we could no way bee deliuered but onely by him that was to come, that onely true <hi>Nazarite</hi> indeede: although hee had deliuered the people then neuer so fully, neuer so gloriously from those theyr Enemies; yet had all that beene but onely some little beginning by that <hi>Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite</hi> then, in comparison of the other to bee performed by the true <hi>Nazarite</hi> after. And to what ende may wee conceiue, that GOD endewed him with so rare and inuincible strength, but to performe some rare and wonderfull deliueraunce then, to some speciall aduancement of the glory of GOD the giuer of it: and to raise vp the hearts of his people to an assured and ioyfull expectation of that grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and more wonderfull deliuerance (into which euen the very Angels, which daily <note place="margin">1. Pet. 1: 12.</note> see the glory of God in Heauen, for the strangenesse and excellency of it, desire to looke) which in time succeeding should bee by the true <hi>Nazarite</hi> performed? May we conceiue: that hee had no farther meaning in it, than for the accomplishment of those atchiuements wherein onely he did imploy it: beeing lightly none other, but quarrels and brables of vnbridled lust, and some others that came by occasion of those? So no doubt that rare strength was giuen him, to haue manned forth the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="T"/> of that his separation to God, and to haue adorned it with the bright beames of some rar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

True indeede, that there was no such absolute deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerance to be expected, but of him that should be an absolute <hi>Nazarite:</hi> and in that respect it was needfull, that the figure should giue place vnto the truth. But euen that figuratiue <hi>Nazarite</hi> also might well haue done whatsoeuer heroicall and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable exploites in that peece of seruice which that rare strength of his (though that seruice of his had bin greater) might haue reached vnto, and so haue made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe more glorious in the Church of God: and yet haue left roome enough for that other to haue gone beyond him infinitely, &amp; with his brightnes to haue ecclipsed his glorie more, than the Sun in his brightnes obscureth the dimmest star in the element. But seeing we see, that doing this good to the people heere, is not ioyned but with separation, let vs also take this lesson vnto vs, that in any wise we must be <hi>Nazarites,</hi> or separated from the loue of the world, our selues, if euer we shal do that good vnto others, that in duty we owe vnto them: and that no man, whatsoeuer good guifts he may haue besides, doth any good duty to his neighbour, but so farre as he hath yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded himselfe to be a <hi>Nazarite</hi> also. Those particular actions of his were two: one, while hee was at his owne libertie; the other, when hee was in his Enemies handes. While hee was at his owne liberty, for the loue of an Harlot, it seemeth, hee went <note place="margin">Iud. 16: 1, 2.</note> down to one of the chiefe Citties of the <hi>Philistims,</hi> but there being knowne, they made fast the Gates against him for that night, meaning to fall vpon him and kill him in the morning. But he rising vp betimes in the morning pulled downe the leaues of the Gate, and the posts whereon they hung, together with the Bars ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: and laying them all on his shoulders, carryed them al to the toppe of an Hill beyond, whence, <hi>Hebron</hi> in <hi>Iudah</hi> farre off from that place, might be decerned. And true it is that Iesus Christ comming downe among vs for the loue of men, Harlots to him, was here among vs closed vp to death: but yet that hee by his owne migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty power made himselfe away from death, and tooke vnto him his life againe; and hath left open that way to others also. When he was in his enemies hands, by yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <note place="margin">Ibid. 25-31.</note> himselfe vnto death, he destroyed many of them; euen all the Princes of the <hi>Philistims,</hi> &amp; much people besides: Christ hauing by his death, not only destroyed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="V"/> the whole power of the enemie, head and taile; but also hauing brought by the vertue of it, infinite numbers of people to God.</p>

And this may bee a good patterne to vs, in what manner such places of adulterate worship, did first growe vp vnto that credit that since they were in. So the Story declareth, first in what sort that adulterate corrupt kind of worshipping grew vp in the Family of one man: then how it came to passe, it was afterward receiued of one whole Citty. To finde out how it grew vp in the Family of one Man, wee are first to consider what it was that was done: then, at what time it may seeme to haue beene. That which was done, was, that in one priuate house there was gotten vp an house of Gods, or a priuate Oratory or Chappell: and so to that end, both Images themselues and their furniture ordained; and a Priest prouided for them. In the ordaining of the Images them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues and of their furniture, we are to consider, from whom that deuise did first pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede: and in what manner the same was prosecuted. It proceeded of a Woman <note place="margin">Iud. 17: 1-5.</note> of <hi>Ephraim,</hi> as it seemeth: in whom we see there was a kinde of deuotion; and yet great impaciency withall. A Fountaine of no speciall likely-hood to yeelde pure Waters of this kind: God hauing appointed, not the <hi>Ephraemites,</hi> but the <hi>Leuites</hi> to teach the people; and his vsuall manner beeing in those matters, to deale by Men, and not by Women. In the manner of prosecuting of it, it seemeth, that first there was an intent or purpose so to doe, that for a time lay but in meaning onely: but yet was effected after. While there was but onely an intent of such a matter, it was but onely in the Woman: and then there came such an accident betwixt, as shee by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> most likely-hood might haue taken to haue beene a checke from God to that her purpose, because that Money-nest of hers, by which she made her reckoning to doe it, was (while she had that meaning) conuayed from her. When afterward it was effected, it was then done not onely by the Woman, but also by a Man, <hi>Micha</hi> her Sonne: but then are we to marke, what infirmity wee finde in each of them before; then, how they agreed in this notwithstanding. In <hi>Michah</hi> we finde, that he pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uily tooke, or stale away that Money-nest of his Mothers, being eleauen hundred Sickles of Siluer, euery Sickle being almost halfe an ounce sterling with vs. In his Mother we finde great impaciency, cruelly curssing and banning him that had taken it from her. Vnto their agreeing afterward in it, it dooth appertaine; first, how the Mony came home again: then, how they ioyntly dispatched the businesse intended. The Mony did <hi>Michah</hi> himselfe bring in vnto her vpon the feare that he had of those her cursses: thereby shewing himselfe to haue a more pliable heart to amend whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer he had done amisse in that kind, than many of vs in these dayes haue, in higher matters a great deale, of the selfesame kind. For many of vs haue taken away much of that, which already was well dedicated (and not onely purposed) not vnto Idolatry, but to the true worship of God: &amp; cannot be ignorant but that by the word of God it is an accursed thing so to do; and that the wisest and most godly learned in all ages since, haue by their actuall and publike denunciation, giuen sufficient warning there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of vnto all. And yet neither is there any such reuerend regard in them toward their Mother the Church, nor to the glory of God, or Soules-health of others, nor any such feare of the cursse wherwith they are already strucken, as with a sentence of condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and which ere long must haue execution accordingly done (if so they persist) as that they are by the one allured, or by the terror of the other vrged, iustly to bring in againe, that which they haue wrongfully taken away: but, on the other side, most of that crewe still holde on the same course; yea, more and more; and by theyr example lead on many others to doe the like, that all may see how infecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

That after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward this Idolatrie was receiued into one whole Citty, it shall bee good first to consider, that so it was: then in what sort the same was performed. In that so it was, we may see how contagious Idolatry is: and that may we see so much the more in the example that now we are in, because we see it had so inconsiderate and base a beginning. But such is the corruption of our nature, that nothing can bee of that kind so senselesse and base, but that soone may it get into credit with vs. It being of the nature of fire, to feede on such things as are apt matter for it (so that euen some little sparkes sometimes haue growne to that head, that they haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed or defaced whole Citties:) wee, on the other side, are as apt and meete to receiue it, as it is by nature inclined to worke vpon vs. The manner wherein the same was performed, was therefore (wee neede not doubt) easie enough: but such withall, as wherein we may see the iust iudgement of God to haue concurred. Easie enough we shall finde it to bee, if wee marke in the Story how it proceeded. The Story is this.

<pb n="248" facs="tcp:7530:135"/> by <hi>Simeon</hi> on the South, by the <hi>Philistims</hi> on the West (by strong hand keeping a great part of that, which to the <hi>Danites</hi> was allotted) and by <hi>Ephraim</hi> and <hi>Benia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min</hi> on the North, sent forth fiue of their company, to search and discouer some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">Iud. 18: 1-7.</note> place for them, whither some of them might goe to inhabit. Those fiue in their way light on the Priest of these new Idols; desire him to inquier what successe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> they should haue in their businesse; haue answere to their good contentment; and so proceede on in their iourney. They light on a Citty, for the site of it, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modiousnesse for habitation, to their desire: and such as they see they may easily get. They returne, and bring word to those that sent them: who preaesently sent <note place="margin">Ibid. 8-21.</note> forth from among them, sixe hundred able men with their families, there to inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit. By the way (admonished by those fiue that were their guides) they stay a while till those go in, and take forth of <hi>Micahs</hi> house, those new Gods and all their furniture, and perswade the Priest that did attend them, to go with them also: and then go on in their iourney again. <hi>Micah</hi> heard of it; followed after an angry man; <note place="margin">Ibid. 22-26.</note> called for his Gods, but might not haue them; and was aduised to keepe him quiet. He therefore seeing, hee was no party, to deall with so many, was faine to giue ouer. They goe on; come to the Citty; easily get it; make it their owne; and there set vp those new-found Gods that thus they brought with them: and, like enough, as giuing them the honour, that they had sped so well in this. So these were in credit, and sought vnto, a long time after. In which, if wee marke, we find it plaine, that it was by the meanes of those fiue men that were sent before: they making the motion of it; and the residue consenting vnto it. Of all which <note place="margin">Iud. 18: 14-21.</note> company there were none of the Priests of the <hi>Leuites,</hi> nor any of the <hi>Leuites</hi> ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (for they were but of the tribe of <hi>Dan;)</hi> neyther were there any of them that had any religious regard that we reade of, but most likely to be men of baser quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty a great deale: one sort of them, subtill to spy out, where others were weake; the residue, as readie to take the aduantage. And yet notwithstanding, it must needs be strange, that, of all that company we reade of none that stoode against it, nor so much as did disswade it. The iust iudgement of God to haue concurred, is plaine likewise, for that when those fiue men would needes haue that Idol-Priest to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of his Idols, what successe they should haue in their iourney, they were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged <note place="margin">I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

And yet the euill spirit that gaue the answere (though not vnlikely but he would grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie them too, so to keepe them more regardfull to those his Idols) may well bee supposed, to haue done it, rather to haue set them on forward to shed the blood of the people of <hi>Lais</hi> than to haue done that pleasure to them, being, as they were in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> duty, &amp; themselues professed, the people of God. At least, themselues might plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly haue seene, that now they were brought in meere bondage vnto those Idols: when as that foolish and paltry Idolatry began with them so soone, and afterward raigned so long with them. For it is plaine, that this Idolatry had place there, in that Citty of <hi>Dan,</hi> all the while the house of God was in <hi>Siloh:</hi> and it is before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded, that <hi>Iudah, Ephraim,</hi> and the other halfe of <hi>Manasses,</hi> hauing their portions <note place="margin">Iud. 18: 31.</note> before set out, while the Tabernacle was in <hi>Gilgal,</hi> the other seauen that remayned, had not their partes set out vnto them, till the people had brought the Tabernacle to <note place="margin">Sect pag.</note>
               <hi>Siloh,</hi> which was in the dayes of <hi>Iosuah</hi> himselfe, Which being brought thither in <hi>Iosuahs</hi> time, was there in the daies of <hi>Helie</hi> also: of whose time it is recorded, and <note place="margin">Ibid. 18. 1.</note> very nere to the end therof, that the Arke was brought thence into the field vnto the people, to aid them against the <hi>Philistims,</hi> then. After which time, because the Ark was then taken thence, &amp; fel into the hands of the <hi>Phlistims,</hi> and so, was kept else-where <note place="margin">1. Sam. 4: 3, 4.</note> many years after, it seemeth, that it also after decayed. Insomuch that <hi>Samuell</hi> imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly after gathered the people, not to <hi>Siloh</hi> now, but vnto <hi>Mizpa:</hi> and <hi>Salomon</hi> at his first comming to his Kingdome, went to worship the Lord, not to <hi>Siloh</hi> neither, <note place="margin">1.

That which sheweth what corruption was among them for life and
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:7530:135"/> conuersation, is the Story next ensuing, wherein are many things worth the marking: some, I grant, but of lesse importance; but others, of greater. Of lesse importance I account a couple, both of them found in such dealing, as diuers times passeth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt friendes, and giuing one good lesson to eyther: both vnto him that giueth en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainement; and to him that is entertained. It is the manner of such as giue en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment, to be sometimes so importunate with their friendes, as in no good time to let them depart: and of such againe as are entertained, to bee so resolute on theyr departure, as that they will in no wise bee stayed, though by lingering their time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, they see they haue not time left them, nowe to set foorth without some danger. Heere we haue an example of both. The <hi>Leuites</hi> Wife (by occasion) went to her <note place="margin">Iud. 19: 1-9</note> friendes before: the <hi>Leuite</hi> himselfe shortly after goeth thither also to bring her home. He is very welcome, and so doth stay accordingly with them. But when <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> nowe they were to depart, and were gotten vp betime for the purpose, needes they must stay yet somewhat longer, at least till they had gotten their Breake-fast. That being done, then was it to late for them to goe forward that night. So they must needes stay till the morning, and then be doing so soone as they would. That mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning being come, yet might they in no wise goe, till they had eaten: and then was it againe to late, that night to set forward. So those that gaue entertainment, were loath to part with them. Now the <hi>Leuite</hi> that was entertained, commeth in to play his part also. What occasion he had we cannot tell: but we see that here, both he &amp; his might haue bin welcome. Yet he would in no wise stay any longer now: but, <note place="margin">Ibid. 10.</note> late though it were, would needes bee going. So taking the time of his setting forth so late as he did, he was faine to lodge by the way, which otherwise he needed <note place="margin">Ibid. 11-1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> not to haue doone: and, as the estate of the Countrey was then, hee could not tell where to bee safe; but needes would ayme it so well as he could. The Issue was <note place="margin">Ibid. 16-<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

Those that are of greater importance, are diuers: most of them discommendable; but yet certaine commendable in them. Of those that are discommendable in them, some there are that are cleere out of quaestion for that matter: others, that are not so very euident, and yet haue good probability with them so to be taken. Those that are cleere out of quaestion for that matter▪ are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine detestable sinnes by them committed, and by the iust iudgementes of GOD accordingly punnished: one, of one particular person; the other, of many. That one particular person was the <hi>Leuites</hi> Wife: and her sinne was, that detesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <note place="margin">Ibid. 2.</note> sinne of Adultery, the abuse of her body in wanton lust. The iudgement of GOD that shortly after did befall her, was, that shortly shee was by a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine kinde of necessity, to withstand a great villany, giuen into the handes of so <note place="margin">Ibid. 22-27.</note> many to be abused, that her life was not able to beare it, but was faine to giue place vnto it. A fearefull iudgement: and so much the rather to be marked of all, as they finde those vnbrideled lusts of theirs to be strong vppon them. Those that were <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> many, were two sorts of the <hi>Beniamites:</hi> one, those beastly Rake-Hels of <hi>Gibeah;</hi> the other, the Heads-men, or chiefe among them. Those beastly Rake-Hels of <note place="margin">Ibid. 22-26.</note>
               <hi>Gibeah,</hi> did first require the <hi>Leuite</hi> himselfe, that they might against nature haue had the abuse of his body: but obtaining his Concubine onely, her they abused all the night, insomuch that praesently shee dyed thereof, in a manner vnder their handes. Those that were the Heads-men or chiefe among them, did two waies offend: one, in that themselues had not their people in better order; the other, that when the rest of their Bretheren would haue had them to punish, they would rather be enemies to those their Bretheren, and suffer it to be a quarrell of Mortall Warre, than deliuer in <note place="margin">Ibid. 20▪ 3, 14, 21.</note> those offenders vnto thē. The iudgement of God that hereupon did fall vpon them, was, that soone after the whole Tribe without regard of Sex or age, together with their Citties and goods were all destroyed, excepting sixe hundred Men onely, they <note place="margin">Ibid. 41-48.</note> hauing then brought forth to the field six and twenty thousand, &amp; seauen hundred, <note place="margin">Ibid 15. 16.</note> and hauing many of these very able to doe speciall good seruice against the Enemy.
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:7530:136"/> Those offences of theirs that are not so euident, but yet haue such probability with them, that they are most likely so to be taken, are first againe, of one particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son: then, of many. That one particular person was the <hi>Leuite,</hi> who, in the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of some, himselfe abuzed that Concubine of his, shee not beeing his lawfull Wife.

Otherwise if a leud Fellowe could intice a young Woman to be naught with him, so might he get her to bee his Wife also, were she neuer so much to good a match for a much better than he. So the Fathers consent is there set, as a barre to such bad dealing: and not to shew, that absolutely it must be had in all lawfull marriages whatsoeuer. But to returne to the <hi>Leuite</hi> againe, it may very well bee, and is most likely, that hee it was that offended with her: and then lesse maruaile, that himselfe afterward came into such danger to bee abused; and that others should execute that, euen to the deapth of all iniquity, that he had begun vnto them before. That he tooke it so very ill when she was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed, <note place="margin">Iud. 19: 29.</note> and was so enraged with it, that not regarding humanity now, nor woman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood neither, hee did so deuide her, bones and all, and sent her abroad, to shewe what villany was done vnto her, and the better to stirre them vp to reuenge, as it is like enough to witnesse, that he would not haue had that affection to her that should so enrage him now, if she had imparted her body to any other but to himselfe: so ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthelesse he seemeth to be faulty also, at least inconsiderate, so to set the whole peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple on fire about it. For we doe not read, that hee sought to the Heads-men of the <hi>Beniamites</hi> first; but vnto all the people generally: nor that he sought vnto them, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to any orderly course of proceeding, but by a strange and barbarous Fact, hewing the dead body of a Woman in peeces, and sending to euery Tribe a-peece, to witnesse, that she was forced to death. For I doe not see that it is warranted, as it seemeth it is conceiued by some, that it should bee such a like matter, as was the <note place="margin">

These many are, euen all the whole company of the Children of <hi>Israell</hi> generally: and first in some part of theyr doinges against the <hi>Beniamites;</hi> then, in some others, against the inhabitants of <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bes-Giliad.</hi> In their dealing against the <hi>Beniamites,</hi> it seemeth, they had some slip or other, because the hand of God was against them so much as it was; and if wee take that hand of God against them, to lead vs to that assurance, that some way or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they did offend, then haue we diuers things in them, that may well be called in question: euen their assembling together at the first; and much of their proceeding after. When they assembled together at the first, we do not reade, that either they sought vnto the Lord to knowe whether they should so doe or not; or sent to their
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:7530:136"/> Bretheren the chiefe and principall Fathers of the <hi>Beniamites,</hi> to see first, whether they would not take some order in it: but that themselues, without either of these, <note place="margin">Iud. 19: 30. 20▪ 1, 2.</note> did venture at it, at the onely instigation of him, who probably might bee intended to haue vrged them so vnto it, altogether as much of priuate affection in his owne gelous indignation, as of any loue of Iustice, or to haue disorder punished; whom also they might doubt, by sending his Concubine peece-meall vnto them, to bee out of temper, and of whom they had not yet heard, that he had sought vnto the Heads-men of the <hi>Beniamites</hi> first. Neither can I aduise mee selfe where they had any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection or warrant, so to assemble themselues together in such a case as this. If any <note place="margin">Deut. 13: 12 18.</note> should forsake the Lord, and fall to Idolatry, they had good direction to do it: but for the administration of ordinary Iustice, in deciding of causes, and punishing dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders, they had euery where Magistrates of their owne appointed (at least, were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected <note place="margin">Deut. 16: 18.</note> so to haue) and we do not reade, that if one Magistrate neglect his duty, the rest were then to set vpon him to force him vnto it. That part of their proceeding after, which now I speake of, was part of it, in what sort they sought vnto God about that matter: and part of it, how they resolued with themselues. They sought vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God about that matter, in such sort as may seeme to bee faulty, twice. First, which of them should first lead against those <hi>Beniamites:</hi> not asking the Lord, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="M"/>
               <note place="margin">Iud. 10: 18.</note> they should go against them, or not (hauing already determined that of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues) but what order they should (in that disorderly attempt which they had) for that point obserued therein. So lesse maruell, when they tooke so much to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, <note place="margin">Ibid. 19-21.</note> and left so little to God, both his aunswere, and their successe, where corres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondent.

Therefore lesse maruell hoere againe, as they mended their waies but little, so both their answere and their successe were but little better than it was before: now being allowed to goe (but without any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of victory) and then leesing but eighteene thousand.

That which is plaine in it selfe, is, that they bound themselues with an Oath that none of them should giue his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <note place="margin">Iud 21: 1.</note> to be Wife to any of the <hi>Beniamites:</hi> which notwithstanding they themselues did in effect afterward breake, when they taught them how to speede themselues of <note place="margin">Ibid. 16-22.</note> the yong women of <hi>Siloh.</hi> That which may be gathered thereof, was, that they were before purposed to slay (without mercie) not onely the men, but the women also, and to leaue none of them liuing. Yet women and children were nothing culpable of the outrage committed on the <hi>Leuites</hi> wife, which before was all the quarrell they had: but now, being enraged, thus farre they exceede their bounds therein. In their dealing against <hi>Iabes-Giliad</hi> they behaued themselues much like <note place="margin">Ibid. 8: 11.</note>

Thus farre, may their doings be called in question by good warrant of the Rules that we haue, as I doe take it, and I doe thinke it so much the more needfull to marke it, because others, not hee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding these, charge them with other things, without any warrant, so the better to

            <p n="6">6 That other particular, in that other Booke next ensuing, is of <hi>Ruth,</hi> a <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abitish</hi> Woman, whom it pleased God to bring in to be one of the Ancestors of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Christ according to the flesh. But seeing it hath pleased God in this Story to set downe, not onely the thing it selfe, but also the meanes whereby it was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passed, therefore is it meetest for vs to consider of both: both of the meanes that were vsed therin; and how the thing it selfe was in the end performed. The meanes that were vsed therein, were some of them such, as it pleased God often to vse to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his children: and some them againe, such as seemed to come of the common infirmitie of our nature. Those that were such as God often vseth towards his children, were that he exercised them with calamity before: both with the want of bodily necessities; and with the want of other succours besides. In that he touched them with the want of bodily necessities, we are to consider, first, how hee touched them therewith: then, what helpe he gaue them withall. He touched them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, first, out of question, when they were faine to leaue their Country because of <note place="margin">Ruth. 1: 1, 2.</note> that famin, and from thence to be tenne yeares together: then also, as it seemeth, when the Widdow her selfe was returned, because the people seemeth to wonder <note place="margin">Ibid. 19. Ibid. 2: 2.</note> at that her present estate; and because her daughter, with the priuitie and consent (when they were come home) went forth a gleaning. The helpe that it pleased God to giue them withall, was, first in the land of <hi>Moab:</hi> then, in their owne Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try when they were returned. In the Land of <hi>Moab</hi> they found present helpe for the time, but as it seemeth to the great impouerishing of them. For when they came home it seemeth they were very poore, in that they holpe themselues with <note place="margin">Ibid. Ibid. 1: 20, 21.</note> that kinde of libertie, that was giuen to the poore; and it may be part of the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of her owne wordes also: and yet when they went forth, it seemeth they were of wealth or in good estate, because they were of so speciall a stock in that City; and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
               <note place="margin">Ibid. 2: 1. Ibid. 4: 3.</note> because yet they had Land remaining when they were againe returned. In their

So haue we in him a very good patterne, how liberall, buxom and cheerefull the richer sort should be in such case vnto the poore: especially, so oft as they haue cause to conceiue so well of them, as <hi>Booz</hi> had at that time of <hi>Ruth</hi> that yong Widdow, for being so dutifull to her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band <note place="margin">Ibid. 11.</note> before, and to her mother in Law after; and in translating her selfe from her owne Country, where they were but heathen people, and ioyning herselfe to the people of God. Those other succours that God tooke from them besides, were all <note place="margin">Ibid 1: 3, 5</note> their Husbands: the Father himselfe and both his Sonnes, and these without issue. And so it pleaseth God oft-times, where his meaning is to do good, there to bring in one calamitie on another before: and then in the end to deo them that good hee meaneth vnto them. But as this losse touched them, some of them more, others lesse, so did they beare it in some reasonable measure: both <hi>Naomie</hi> the Mother; and the daughters besides. The mother had the greatest losse, because shee lost first her Husband, then both her Sonnes: and yet bare it so quietly, that she still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained special good wil to those her daughters in Law, and thereupon for their good, was earnest with them to stay in their owne Country when shee her selfe <note place="margin">Ibid. 6-13.</note> meant to returne.

But <hi>Booz</hi> indeed (as his wordes declare) did not otherwise take it; and so commended her for that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard <note place="margin">Ruth. 3: 10-18:</note> to her former Husband, and that she followed not young folke now; and promised withal, that if another, neerer than hee, would not looke to haue her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, then would himselfe take her to wife. Wherein, besides the equity whereto in that case hee yeelded, he gaue a notable example of continency too, so to forbeare as in that case he did. It was in the end performed, first, by giuing that other Kinsman of his the choise: and when he refused, by taking her vnto himselfe; <note place="margin">Ibid. 4: 1-17.</note> &amp; so begetting <hi>Obed</hi> of her, one of the ancesters of Iesus Christ.

               <pb n="254" facs="tcp:7530:138"/> 7 That other Booke ensuing, wherein we haue the Story of part of those that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> were their Iudges, is the first of <hi>Samuel,</hi> called also by some the first of the Kings; and they are but two of them of whom wee haue any Story there: of whom wee haue something to note of them both together; and something, of eyther seuerally. Of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> them both together, that whereas they were Ecclesiasticall persons (as wee doe call them) and yet gouerned the whole people, it is not a thing so abhorring Nature as some haue taken it, that those two powers should at any time concurre together in one. But that will after appeare more plainely, in the Commission giuen vnto <hi>Esra.</hi> Comming therefore to eyther of them more specially, we finde that one of them go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned the people euen to his death: but the other, while himselfe liued, was dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged of it. He that gouerned them euen to his death, was <hi>Elie</hi> the High-Priest, who did not in his time so finish all, but that a remnant of that his gouernment con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued something longer, that best may be to him also ascribed. So are wee first to consider of that which wee finde in the time of his life: then, of that remnant that extended it selfe somewhat after his death. That which we finde in the time of his life, is nothing at all of any publique gouernment: neither of his comming to that place of authority, nor in what manner he behaued himselfe therein; but onely, that what time he finished his course, hee then had iudged the people forty yeares, and <note place="margin">1. Sam 4: 18.</note> was an old man when he dyed. So it seemeth, that his iudging of the people was but in such controuersies as were among them, and in such other matters as concerned thē seuerally, and were not of the greatest moment, the <hi>Philistims</hi> bearing so great a <note place="margin">Iud. 13: 1.</note> sway among them as thē they did. For they had them in subiection as we saw before, forty yeares. In the next twenty ascribed to <hi>Sampson,</hi> wee saw that he did little a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <note place="margin">Ibid. 15: 20. 16: 31.</note> them, but onely in certaine odde priuate quarrels: and of this man wee haue, for those matters, nothing at all. But as he was the High-Priest withall, wee haue some Story of him, though nothing to his honour neyther: but that therein also hee so offended that it was the ruine of him, and almost of all his house besides. So are we first to consider, wherein he offended: then, what was his punnishment for it. His offence was, that his Sonnes were so disorderly: and so little restrained by him. Their disorder was, principally in that which they did to the derogation of the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of God (which he, by the vertue of his office, should haue amended:) but part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in abusing themselues with others also. That which they did to the derogation of Gods seruice, was, that they so encroched vpon the people for Fees in their offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> and sacrifices, that they made the people to loath the seruice of God. They encroched vppon them two wayes: one, to haue more than their due; the other, to bee serued before that they should. To haue more than their due, they helde not <note place="margin">1. Sa. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

To bee serued before they should, they would not tarry till the fat of the Sacrifice was first burnt on the Altar as God appointed: but woulde first haue those <note place="margin">Ibid. 15, 16.</note> Fees that to them were allotted, and so haue their partes before the Lorde their Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster had his. In making the people thereby to loath the seruice of God, their offence <note place="margin">Ibid. 17.</note> must needs be the greater, for that the people being euer slow enough of themselues to the worship of God, they should not be farther hindred by others. By al which they are concluded to haue beene very bad, and not to haue knowne the Lord, nor his <note place="margin">Ibid. 12.</note> seruice towards the people. Those others with whom they abused themselues, were certaine Women that repaired thither, and there awaited the seruice of God. A <note place="margin">Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>lie</hi> himselfe did restraine them, may reasonably appeare, in that they became so bad Imps as they were: but yet more plainely, that when on all hands he heard so much else of them, yet did hee
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:7530:138"/> then also reprooue them so gently for it. In the punishment that was cast on him <note place="margin">Ibid. 22-25</note> for it, when first we haue considered of it as it was laid vpon him: then, it shall not be amisse to aduise our selues also, how wee may best apply it to our selues. As it was laid vpon him, we finde, that first it was fore-shewed: then after, executed vpon him. It was fore-shewed twice: first, by one that purposely came vnto him from the Lorde about that matter; then, by <hi>Samuell,</hi> then but a Childe, and but relating or repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vnto him (as <hi>Elie</hi> did charge him) what it was the Lord on a time had said vnto him. When that man of God came purposely to him about that matter, we reade of no answer that <hi>Elie</hi> gaue him, nor of any thing else that at that time ensued there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. So are we but to consider of the message it selfe, and therein; first, because the message <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> that he brought was heauy, what reason God had so to deale with him, and that God might neuerthelesse be iustifyed therein: then, in what sort hee was to bee dealt with. The reason resteth on two principall members: one, the fauours of God towardes him; the other, his ill dealing with God againe. His fauours were two: one, that he chose him aboue all others to be his Priest; the other, that he gaue <note place="margin">1. Sa. 2: 27, 28 Ibid. 29.</note> him all the offeringes of the Children of <hi>Israell</hi> made by fire. His ill dealing with God againe, that he made light of Gods seruice, for his Sonnes sake, to make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues fat of the chiefe and principall partes of those thinges whereof was made ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to God: as winking (belike) at that importunity of his Sonnes, vrging such customes to their owne aduantage, although hee might see, that beeing more than God allowed, it could not otherwise be, but that the people would be offended, and thereupon giue lesse regard to that seruice of God. In denouncing vnto him, how he was to deale with him for the same; first, hee setteth himselfe free from a certaine former promise of fauour: and then commeth to those thinges that were ensuing. His former promise, he graunteth, was, that his Fathers house should euer stand with <note place="margin">Ibid. 30.</note> that Office, or should euer enioy the Priest-hood, but now he telleth him, it shall not be so; and giueth in this reason for it, that he will honour those that honour him, and that such as despise him, shall be despised. Comming to those things that were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing; first, he sheweth him, what they should bee: then, how he may bee assured of them. In shewing what they shall be, he denounceth indeede heauy things against him; but yet sheweth withall, that they shall be something allaied with mercy. Those heauy thinges that he denounceth against him, were, for the most part to be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished after his time: but one of them, in his owne dayes also. After his time, <note place="margin">Ibid. 31-33.</note> that the honour of his house should vtterly fall, and thence-forward be of no recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning among the people: and that there should not be an old man of his Family, but that when they came to mans state, they should then commonly dye. That which <note place="margin">Ibid. 32.</note> should be in his owne dayes, was, that himselfe should see the Enemy to praeuaile and so to enioy the best thinges of the Land. The mercy that was promised withall, <note place="margin">Ibid. 33.</note> was, that hee would not so destroy his posterity, but that some of them should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine, and be implyed in his seruice, in the office of the Priest-hood: and the reason thereof to be, that God will not cleane ouerwhelme him with sorrow, but leaue that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> measure of comfort vnto him. For the certainty of these thinges, that so hee may be assured of them; first, he giueth him a signe: and then resolueth him of a doubt that to the contrary might bee conceiued. The signe that hee did giue vnto him, <note place="margin">Ibid. 34.</note> was, that both his Sonnes should in one day dye. The doubt that might bee to the contrary conceiued, was, that as yet there was none other appointed to attend his seruice. To that it is answered, that he will prouide himselfe of another, to his bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <note place="margin">Ibid. 35, 36.</note> contentment: and that such as were left of his house, should in their pouerty seek vnto him to be in some place of seruice about the Altar, that so they might be able to liue. When the denouncing of these heauy thinges was renewed vnto him againe by the relation of <hi>Samuell,</hi> we finde, that <hi>Elie</hi> then gaue some answere thereto: and so are we first to consider, what it was that <hi>Samuell</hi> told him; then, what answere hee gaue vnto it. That which <hi>Samuell</hi> tolde him was in effect, the same which was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced vnto him before: yet first but generally, not shewing what it should bee, but onely some strange and heauy iudgement; but afterward, what it should bee in particular also. Generally, that it should be such a thing, as that whosoeuer should <note place="margin">1. Sam. 3: 11.</note>
               <pb n="256" facs="tcp:7530:139"/> heare of it, should be exceedingly astonished at it. More specially, that hee would <note place="margin">Ibid. 12-14.</note> certainely bring vpon <hi>Elie,</hi> and vpon his house, that which he had threatned before, because of that facility of his towardes his Sonnes so offending: and that for this matter, there should no sacrifice serue, but that the things already denounced should come vppon them. The aunswere of <hi>Elie</hi> to this, was, that it was the Lord: and <note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

And these two, that it is the Lord, and all thinges to be as pleaseth him, may well go together, in all our affaires, euen in those that concerne vs neerest of all: and neuer ought to be put asunder. We should euer know, that all such thinges come of the Lord, and neuer should we repine at any thing he dooth vnto vs. The execution of it followed: on his Sonnes and him, very soone after, in the Story that now wee are in; on his posterity in the processe of time ensuing, without the compasse of this praesent Story. As touching that which this Story sheweth to be done to his Sons <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> and him (wherewith we are for this time to bee contented) it was so annexed vnto the estate of the whole people, ouer whom his gouernment for his time stood, that we cannot consider of the one, but that we must take in the other withal; but that to very good purpose too, euen in respect of <hi>Ely</hi> himselfe, because it was the fruit of his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment, and so to be in that respect to him ascribed. Neuerthelesse we shall not do amisse, in the Story distinctly to consider, what portion thereof redounded to his sons and him: and what to all the people besides. The <hi>Philistims</hi> therefore nowe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming <note place="margin">1. Sam. 4: 1, 2.</note> in againe, and the <hi>Israelites</hi> meeting them in the fielde, the <hi>Israelites</hi> were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrowne, and lost to the number of foure thousand. Heereupon they thought <note place="margin">Ibid. 3▪ 18</note> good to send vnto <hi>Siloh,</hi> to fetch the Arke out of the Tabernacle there, and to bring it into the fielde, and so to assay the <hi>Philistims</hi> againe, hoping that so they shoulde haue some hand against them. But so also they were ouerthrowne, much more grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uously than before, lost thirty thousand, and those that remained were faine to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne beaten home. And they being so offensiue to God as they were, it was but in vaine for them (so inordinately withall) to get into their company the Arke of his Couenant, which themselues so fouly had broken: much like to those Exorcists in the Apostles time, who not beleeuing in Christ themselues, would neuerthelesse assay, in his name to cast out Deuils, till they found, to their shame and hurt, that the Name <note place="margin">Act. 19: 13-16.</note> of Iesus auailed not those that beleeued not in him. Which notwithstanding could not be such warning to vs, but that in the dayes of our late ignorance, many of vs ranne our Shippes on the selfe-same shelfe: not onely in the Name of Iesus, but in many other such like besides. In this latter battle, both <hi>Hophnie</hi> and <hi>Phineas</hi> the sonnes of <hi>Elie,</hi> were slaine: and when himselfe heard of the euill successe of that field, being an old man and an heauy, being fourescore and eighteene yeares old, hee fell downe backeward, whereby also his necke was broken. That which redounded to the people besides, were, first these two ouerthrowes in the field: then also that their glory, the Arke of the Lord was taken, and carried away by the <hi>Philistims.</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch that the Wise of <hi>Phinehas</hi> at that time trauailing, and being deliuered of a sonne, would needes haue his name to bee <hi>No-glory,</hi> as if all glory were now vtterly <note place="margin">Ibid. 19-22.</note> departed from that people, when as the Arke was thus led captiue. And that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple is without glory indeed, who professing God do so behaue themselues towards him, that he departeth and giueth them vp vnto themselues. In the application of this his punishment vnto our selues, it may be it would bee conceiued, that this were meetest to be applyed vnto our Ministery: and true it is, that so farre as our Ministery is in such sort faulty, either encroaching vpon the people in their oblations to God, or ouer-carelesse of the ill wayes of their Children, it may fitly be applyed vnto them indeede. But as these dayes are, howsoeuer they also may be as much blinded in their affection towardes their Children as others are: yet in those thinges that haue beene well giuen vnto God, and in aequity ought still to remaine vnto him, wee may easily finde, that others are a great deale more faulty then they; and yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing many of these faulty also. For as they are of the Laity onely to speake of, that are so greedy vpon Churchl-iuinges, that should bee to the maintenance of the Gospell among vs, to conuert them to their owne proper vse, and the same but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane:
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:7530:139"/> so are there some of the Cleargy likewise, that are as ready for their owne pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate aduantage, to gratifie them therewith; and themselues sometimes to turne them to lay-fee, to the vse of their Children or friends, so farre as in such case they may bee able. By which kind of dealing of them both, it commeth to passe, that euen the most needfull Church-liuings that are, are so decayed, and that daily more and more, that the Churches thereby are spoyled of able men, and driuen oft-times to take in so base a kind to make supplie, that with vs also the offering of the Lord, euen in these daies of the Gospell, is much abhorred by many, who otherwise it is likely might be reclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. In which case, who it is that must supply the person of <hi>Elie,</hi> is soone percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. For it is none but such onely as are in Soueraigne Authority that in such case can helpe: and therefore it is they that must before God stand charged with it. Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer they are, that are their subiects, great or small, they are also their children, by their indulgence, take any such waies, as whereby they may make the seruice of God to be abhorred. That remnant of his gouernment that extended it selfe somewhat after his death, was about the Arke of the Lord. Concerning which wee haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered vnto vs, some Story of it, first from the time that now it was taken captiue of the <hi>Philistims,</hi> vntill the time that it was returned home againe: then, for some time afterward also, that did follow immediately after. From the time it was taken, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> the time that it was returned home againe, the Story of it sheweth, how mightily it praeuailed against the enemie in their owne Land: and how triumphantly it came home to his owne Countrey againe. As touching the former, although they had so offended, that God in his Iustice would vouchsafe no glory to them: yet did not himselfe let downe his owne glory thereby, but went, as it were, to the enemies land, there to beate them downe at home round about him, both their Gods, and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple withall, till at length they were glad to be rid of it, and themselues to send it home againe with honour. For placing it first in the Temple of <hi>Dagon</hi> one of their gods, <note place="margin">1. Sam. 5: 1-3.</note> as giuing him the glory ouer the God of <hi>Israell,</hi> the next morning they found that <hi>Dagon</hi> was fallen downe on his face before the Arke, so doing his homage to the God of <hi>Israell.</hi> Euen as in our time the Gospell no sooner tooke place among vs, but that our wonted Idols were faine to bee packing. And setting him vppe in his <note place="margin">Ibid. 4.</note> place as before, the next morning likewise, they found him fallen before the Arke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, and much worse now than before, his head and his handes being broken off on the threshold by his fall. As it falleth out with Popery in these daies of the Gospel: that the oftener the wel-willers thereof, in any of their seuerall territories, set it vppe againe, the sorer it falleth, till at length it haue neither head to deuise, nor hand to helpe it selfe with. Yet as the Priests of <hi>Dagon</hi> gathered no more thereon, but thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forward neuer to step on the threshold of <hi>Dagon:</hi> so our <hi>Dagon-Priests</hi> likewise can <note place="margin">Ibid. 5.</note> espie no power of God therein, but vanish away in some Idle toy, one or other. How he executed his iudgements farther on their gods, in particular, we haue not deliuered vnto vs: but that his hand was sn heauie on them also, we finde by confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of some of themselues. The people we finde were grieuously plagued, both in <note place="margin">Ibid. 6: 5.</note> their persons, and in their grounds. In their persons they were plagued with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent death of diuers of them: and with one speciall disease besides. By death it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth <note place="margin">Ibid. 5: 6, 9-12.</note> that many of them were taken away: and so strangely withall, that readily they ascribed it to the hand of the Lord vpon them. Such as died not, were stroken <note place="margin">Ibid. 6, 9, 10, 12.</note> with Hemrods in their secret parts, both small &amp; great, in so painfull maner, that their cry was very great. How they were plagued in their grounds, we haue not the Story, but onely a briefe recitall or reference of it: namely, that their land was destroyed <note place="margin">Ibid. 6: 5.

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> with Mise. For as for that which we haue in the vulgar Translation, in the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter before▪ in the end of the sixt verse, it is not in the Originall: and it is the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of some, that it was taken out of the Greeke; of other, that out of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent it was by some vnskilfull body put into the Text, as many other places, saith he, besides. But that Mise did so destroy the Land, there is no question, both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is plainely so said, and because they so made their offering also, as wee are now shortly to see. Vnto the triumphant returning of it againe it doth apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne, first that he so wrought in the hearts of the <hi>Philistims,</hi> that now they were
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:7530:140"/> weary of it, and affraide any longer to keepe it: then, that it returned so as it did. Being weary of it now, and affraide any longer to keepe it, they call for their Priests and Sooth sayers, and inquier of them, what they shal do with the Arke of the Lord, and how they shall send it home againe. The question hath two principall parts, as it is very plaine to all; but the answere is giuen to the latter only; thereby shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">1. Sam. 6: 2.</note> vs, that the <hi>Philistims</hi> themselues were resolued on the former. To the latter part of it therefore their answere was giuen; and that in such sort, as is right wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be marked of vs: both for the direction that by it they gaue vnto the <hi>Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stims;</hi> and for that it was so well by them obeyed. For the direction they gaue them tended to this end, that they should humble themselues vnto God, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge it to be his hand vpon them: and they doe not onely tel them, that so they should doe, but exhort them likewise to doe it. In telling them what they should doe, first they tell them that they may not send it away emptie: then, what it must be wherewith they must furnish it. That doe they tel them, first but ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally, that it must be some kind of Sinne-offering, to acknowledge their sinne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <note place="margin">Ibid. 3-5.</note> the Lord; then, vpon their farther inquiry, they tell them more specially, what it must be, namely, the similitude of fiue of their hinder-parts annoyed with Emrods, and of fiue Mise besides, according to the number of their seuerall Princes or States; and al these to bee of gold. Whereby they set them in a very good course for the hand of God vpon them, both on their persons and on their Land: but as for the hand of God vpon them in their Gods, that doe they but huddle-vp together with the rest in words, and doe not deuise them some memorial of it also; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/>
               <note place="margin">Ibid. 5</note> and that may be, because a good part of their maintenance and credit might lie vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it. A true patterne of such acknowledging of sinne, as for the most part is found among vs: granting with such as our selues doe make least reckoning of; and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing that which is dearest vnto vs. The exhortation that they had hereunto, is good likewise so farre as it goeth: disswading them from hardening their hearts, as the <hi>Egyptians</hi> before had done; and exhorting them to yeeld indeed, and so to <note place="margin">Ibid. 6. Ibid 7-9. Ibid. 10, 11.</note> send away the Arke accordingly. The obedience of the <hi>Philistims</hi> was such at this time, that in al things they did as they were directed: both in that acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging of their sinne, and of the hand of God vpon them for it; and in sending home the Arke againe, and in such manner as was appointed. The Arke being thus <note place="margin">Ibid. 12.</note> dismissed, as it came directly home againe, so if we marke, we may quickly see, that it came very triumphantly also: first, because it so came home by it selfe; then, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it came with the spoil of they enemy. It came home by it selfe, for that it had none other helpe at al, but rather to the contrary to keepe it there stil: yet not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying, <note place="margin">Ibid. 12-16.</note> but that the <hi>Philistims</hi> did attend it, or followed after, euen to the Coasts of <hi>Bethshemes</hi> it selfe. But that might be to some other purpose: as to see the strang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the thing; and not of any mind in them to helpe it forward, as by the order that for it they tooke, may well appeare. For neither were the Kie that should haue it home, vsed to the yoke, and so nothing likely to yeeld it such helpe <note place="margin">Ibid. 7.</note> to such a purpose as others might haue done that had been vsed to draw: and they were such besides, as had new calued, and had their calues taken from them and kept behind, the greatest prouocation they could haue had, to haue staide them there also, and neuer to haue offered one foote forward. Whereby it seemeth, that the <hi>Philistims</hi> were not yet so fully resolued (neither the Princes and people on the one side, nor on the other the Priests themselues (that it was the Lord that thus had laide his hand vpon them, or that this visible testimony of his went euer by his direction or power; or else that it was for detayning or seazing of it, that they were thus plagued: But that now they would see this miraclous dealing to confirme them in it; or at least put it vnto the tryall, to get home by it selfe if it would. Of which the former was token plaine inough of such weakenesse in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="L"/> them: and the latter, of worse heart than so, ioyned withal. And yet were it well, if those that haue so greedily seazed on the needful and lawfull maintenance of the Ministery, and detaine it yet, would in some good time so remember themselues therein, as to afford it though but such meanes to returne againe, as the <hi>Philistims</hi>
               <pb n="259" facs="tcp:7530:140"/> heere did vnto the Arke: but otherwise may they account themselues more <hi>Philistim-</hi>like than the <hi>Philistims</hi> themselues, if they cannot finde in their hearts to put it to so easie an aduenture as this. The <hi>Philistims</hi> no doubt might haue had the <hi>Israelites</hi> themselues, and the Priests and the <hi>Leuites,</hi> to haue fetcht home the Arke vnto them: but belike they were not so resolutely determined to part with it so cleerely; but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to put it to this aduenture. So might ours haue the ancient owners themselues to fetch home those thinges with right good-will, if so it might stand with their good pleasure: but as those owners themselues will graunt, that it is more than they doe looke for; so let these <hi>Philistims</hi> of ours also consider, if they affoord no way at all vnto it, how they doe therein discharge any one part of that duty to God. It came home likewise with the spoile of the Enemy, for that in a Casket by the side of it, <note place="margin">Ibid. 8, 11, 17, 18.</note> it brought home with it those Iewels aforesaide; Iewels I say, not so much because they were of Gold; as for that they were Eye-witnesses (at least, in part) what exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution he had done among them, and how hee had driuen them to acknowledge his hand therein. It may be also, that if our <hi>Philistims</hi> will in no good time remember themselues in that other aforesaide Arke of Gods Testimony, but still detaine it cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue to their profane desires: God may haue some good time wherein he wil do such execution on them and theirs, that as thereby both he will driue them (will they, nill they) to acknowledge his iudgements on them, though fearefull, yet iust; and, in the end, to giue him the glory. For the time that now did follow immediatly after that the Arke was returned home againe, wee haue little Story of it, but onely for that praesent when it was first returned: at which time it was a while at <hi>Bethshemes;</hi> but soone after had to <hi>Kiriahjarim.

In which <note place="margin">1. Sam. 6: 14.</note>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="M"/> place we are to make; first, how the Arke was intertained of the people there: then, how the Lord shewed himselfe to be offended. Of the people it was diuersly enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained: some shewing a good affection towardes it; others making too bold with it. Those that shewed a good affection towardes it, were those, that beeing reaping <note place="margin">Ibid. 13.</note> their Corne in the fields, reioyced so soone as they saw it: and they withall, that with the Wood of the Cart wherein it was, offered in Sacrifice the Kie that brought it thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; <note place="margin">Ibid. 14.

Princes being taken prisoners in the field, haue neuer lightly wanted subiects that were so carefull for them, but that either by force or composition they would quickly set in hand to deliuer them. Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Castles suddenly and strangely lost, haue often had those that presently would venture their liues to get them againe. When battails haue found an end in the field, and parties haue beene withdrawing to their Tents againe, yet finding then, that some man of worth, or but their colours were carying away, which might be recouered, euen that onely hath often renewed the fight, and beaten downe many a valiant man, till they had their desire. The world is full of such examples: but the Church of God, the people of <hi>Israel,</hi> often at other times maruellous valle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, haue now shamed themselues for euer. They haue suffered the Arke of the
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:7530:141"/> Lord, the visible testimonie of his presence among them, the comfort and glory of all the faithfull, the chiefe it well of all the Sanctuary, not onely to be led away, but also to be held captiue there so long together; and, for ought that they could conceiue, in the most despightfull manner that might be deuised: and, all this while, made no <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="P"/> meanes at all to get it deliuered. In so much that now also the Lord was faine to treade the Vine-presse of his wrath himselfe alone, and had none to helpe, but <note place="margin">Isa. 63: 1-6.</note> was faine to stand by his owne strength. But when now he thus commeth from <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

And seeing their fault was in it selfe so open and plaine, what neede was there, the Text should set downe in plaine tearmes wherefore it was? Thus therefore I take it, that whereas the Text first set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth downe two strikings of the Lord, one of the <hi>Bethshemes</hi> and addeth the cause for <note place="margin">Ari. Mont.</note> looking into the Arke, the other of the people (which seemeth to bee the rest of the <hi>Israelites)</hi> and there addeth no cause; and immediately after setteth downe the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of those that were stroken in two seuerall summes, the lesse first, and most agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to one Cittie, the greater last; and most agreeable to all the people: it is most likely, that onely those threescore and tenne men of <hi>Bethshemes</hi> were so stroken for looking into the Arke at that present; and that the Lord, hauing begunne so to cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice his owne people there, immediately vpon this his returne, would now proceede to the residue also, and in like sort dispatch with them. In which case, though it bee not saide wherefore it was: yet laying their so fowle, and so long neglecting of him, and this his new returne together, may seeme vnto me, resonable plainely to point vnto it. The place indeede, I grant, is hard: and if any doe see farther into it, it is great reason it be accordingly regarded. But so it hath beene among vs also. The Holy-Bible may wee account to haue beene vnto vs, as the Arke was vnto them. This Arke of ours when time was, was taken away by certaine <hi>Philistims</hi> of ours, and helde in captiuitie long: and in the time of that captiuitie many indignities haue beene done vnto it. All which time both Princes and peoples haue forgotten them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues so farre, for most part of them, that they neuer attempted any way to recouer it againe, but helde themselues quiet, as though therein they had neyther disgrace nor losse at all. Now in these dayes it is returned vnto vs againe, appearing to vs when <note place="margin">Isa. 65: 1.</note> we asked not for it. Lesse maruell therefore, if hauing drawne blood in plentifull measure on the enemie already, and daily doing it more and more, he enter into iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Q"/> with such of vs likewise, as all that while cared so little for him: that so men may the better learne, what euils soeuer they haue with the Gospell not to impute them (as they are wont) to the Gospell it selfe, but to that prophane carelesnesse of theirs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, when the truth of God was as little by them desired, as it was troden cleane vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der foote by that cursed enemie.</p>
            <p n="8">8 He that gouerned the people of God for a time, but afterward was in his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> owne dayes discharged of it, was <hi>Samuell</hi> the Prophet. Concerning whom, the Story goeth first on his Parents: then on himselfe. His Parents were <hi>Helcanah</hi> and <hi>Hannah</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. 1: 1, 2.</note> In <hi>Helcanah</hi> his Father we haue something commendable: and something reproua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Commendable it was, that yeerely he went vp to <hi>Siloh</hi> to worship and Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice: and euen then, when those bad Sonnes of <hi>Elie</hi> did minister there. It was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prouable, <note place="margin">Ibid. 3-5.</note> both that he went thither no oftner (for God had appointed thrice): and, that he had two wines. Of <hi>Hannah</hi> it is noted, that she was something distressed for <note place="margin">Ibid. 2.</note> a time: but yet not withstanding, not forsaken in it. Her distresse was, that for a time <note place="margin">Idid. 2, 5. 10. Ibid 6, 7. Ibid. 5, 8.</note> she was barren: and that her aduersary did vpbraide her with it. Shee was not forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in it, but had comfort giuen her partly by her Husband: but especially by God. Her Husband seeing her sorrowfull for it, did louingly and kindly vse her: and assured of such good affection in him towards her although she bare him no chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren▪ that that matter need to trouble her nothing at all. The comfort that she had of the Lord, was not onely in giuing this vnto her that now she desired: but in grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:7530:142"/> fauours which she did not desire, yet he afterward bestowed on her. In that which she desired, wee haue noted, first that she sought it: then how she obtained. In her seeking of it, we haue not onely that deliuered vnto vs: but another speciall accident withall, that came in by occasion of it. She sought it by earnest prayer, beseeching God to remember her therein: and vowing withal, that if it were a Sonne, she would <note place="margin">Ibid. 9-13.</note> freely giue him vnto the Lord, to be a <hi>Nazarit</hi> vnto him. That other accident, that by occasion of it came in withall, was that same misiudging of <hi>Elie,</hi> reputing her <note place="margin">Ibid. 9, 14-18.</note> as a drunken Woman, and reprouing her accordingly: but vppon her quiet and modest answere, better perswaded of her soone after. The best men of all doe some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> misiudg of others: but, it is well, when they can come to a better bent so easily as wee see that <hi>Elie</hi> did. Vnto her obtaining of that which she sought, there is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other thing belonging: and so first of that her obtaining: then, of that other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing <note place="margin">Ibid. 19, 20.</note> vnto it. That which she obtained was, that shortly after she conceiued, and hauing a Sonne, called his name <hi>Samuell.</hi> That other belonging vnto it, was, in what sort she now performed her vow of bestowing him freely on the Lorde: which she did very well, both in her first bestowing of him; and, that sometimes after shee did visite him so as shee did. In her first bestowing of him, both shee brought the Childe himselfe, so soone as he was any thing meete to such a purpose: and withall, gaue speciall thankes vnto God. In her first bringing of her Sonne to the Lord, we are to note, not onely what it was that in truth she did: but also, how it may appear in the Text that so she did. That which in truth shee did, was, that she brought <note place="margin">Ibid. 21-28.</note> him then to the Lord, when he was by his age reasonable able to serue the Lord. To finde out, how it may appeare in the Text that so she did, wee neede no more but to consider the nature of one word onely, that which commonly is taken for <hi>Waining:</hi> as though that then shee had brought him to <hi>Elie,</hi> so soone as shee had wained him from her breast. For though for the most part that word be so interpreted: yet are <note place="margin">

In which point the diligence of these is so much the more commendable, for that the others, by giuing that other signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the word in those other places (at least, for most of them) yet in this place where the sense doth so necessarily require it, they were not so well aduised, as so to yeeld it.

Her Thankes-giuing, it seemeth, was some part of it but doubtfull: but the other, cleane out of quaestion.

Her visiting him after, as shee did, was, that euery yeare comming to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:7530:142"/> she did vse to bring him withall a little Coate: and so declared thereby (so farre as that extended) that it was not to disburthen her-selfe of the charge of him, that she so bestowed him on <hi>Ely</hi> to the Lordes vse; but euen of meere loue to the Lorde for vouchsafing to giue him vnto her, and therefore contributing (as it were) thus far also, towardes his maintenance in the Lordes seruice. Those other fauours which she did not desire, yet God did after bestow vpon her, were such as did plainly shew, that she was no leeser in bestowing that Sonne of hers vpon God: and therefore it shall be good to consider heere, first, what those fauours were; then, to leaue this to bee marked withall, whether shee were not well rewarded. Those other fauours were two: one, that he made that Childe of hers to bee of rare and speciall account; the other, that he gaue her Children besides. He made this Childe of hers of spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall account; first in his Child-hood: then when hee came to mans estate. In his <note place="margin">Ibid. 20, 26. 3: 20.</note> child-hood, for that <hi>Ely</hi> himselfe was so pleased with him: and that the people made speciall reckoning of him. When he came to mans estate, hee was not onely a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table <note place="margin">Ibid &amp; 7: 15. Ibid. 12: 3, 4.</note> Prophet, and the chiefe Gouernour of the people: but (that more is) a very good man towardes God also. Those other Children that God gaue her besides, were, as it seemeth, fiue: three Sonnes, and two Daughters. For there is no quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, <note place="margin">1. Sam. 2: 21.</note>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> but of one of the Sonnes, whether <hi>Samuell</hi> bee to bee accounted one of the three or not: but there be that read, that shee conceiued and bare three Sonnes and two Daughters, <hi>While</hi> the Childe <hi>Samuell</hi> grewe vp towardes the Lord; which if it <note place="margin">Tremel. Iun.</note> may stand, maketh the matter cleane out of quaestion. If now the quaestion bee, whether she were not well rewarded, the matter is so plaine in it selfe, that it leaueth this comfort vnto vs, that we cannot truely giue our selues or ours vnto the Lord, but that we are like (he euer continuing all one) to be richly at his handes rewarded for it. The Story comming now to <hi>Samuell</hi> himselfe, something it dooth deliuer vnto vs of his child-hood: but more, of his gouernment. Of his Childe-hoode, that the Lorde appeared vnto him: and that the same was knowne to the people. That the Lord appeared vnto him, though it bee glorious enough in it selfe, yet first there is another circumstance also remembred, which doth much more commend it vnto vs. So first of that circumstance: then, of the Lordes appearance vnto him. That <note place="margin">1. Sam. 3: 1.</note> circumstance was, that in those dayes the Lord did not vouchsafe to appeare vnto a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny: insomuch that such manifestation of his will and pleasure vnto him, was now ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry rare and precious among them. And a speciall good token is it of his fauour to any, when it pleaseth him to impart his will and pleasure vnto them: as on the other side, it is likewise a token of his great displeasure, when there are none among vs, by whom it will please him to speake vnto vs. As touching the Lordes appearing to him, it shall bee good first to consider that hee did so appeare vnto him: then of the businesse about which it pleased him so to appeare. That hee did so appeare vnto him, to impart a peece of his minde vnto him in a matter that hee meant one day to doe, is in it selfe a token of speciall fauour: as when one friende breaketh his minde to another, in such thinges as he would not doe, but vnto such as were inward with him. As touching the businesse about which hee did appeare vnto him, it was most concerning <hi>Ely</hi> his Mayster: and in effect none other but the same of which God had sent word before to <hi>Ely</hi> himselfe. But here haue wee to consider, not onely what it was: but also in what sort <hi>Ely</hi> did take it. It was no more but this, that whereas before hee had sent him word of heauy iudgements towardes him, for that he suffered his Sons so to abuse themselues as they did, now he telleth this Child also, that he is fully determined so to doe: but yet he speaketh in such sort of it now as that others also were to haue some heauy part of those his iudgements; and so doth the Story, that after followeth, shew that they had. So are wee first to consider, what <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> portion of those his iudgments may seeme to respect others withall: then, what they are, that doe more properly concerne him. Those that respect others withall, may seeme to be those two ouerthrowes that the <hi>Philistims</hi> afterward gaue to the people <note place="margin">1. Sam. 4: 1, 2.</note> of God: especially the latter of them: and, at that time, the taking away of the Arke <note place="margin">Ibid. 10, 11.</note> withall. It may seeme so to bee, for that himselfe doth make it so generall a confusion to all, that whosoeuer should heare thereof, both his eares should tingle at it. Those <note place="margin">1. Sam. 3: 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note>
               <pb n="264" facs="tcp:7530:143"/> that doe more properly concerne him, are some of them but the effect of that which was threatned vnto him before: but one thing more there is, which is added nowe. Those that are but the effect of those thinges that were threatned before, are what <note place="margin">Ibid. 12. 13.</note> iudgementes he will bring vpon him, and why. That which is added more nowe, <note place="margin">Ibid. 14.</note> is, that Oblations and Sacrifices shall not bee accepted of him, to stay the execution, that hee is nowe resolued to doe vppon him. And there is no quaestion, but that men may so farre incurre the displeasure of GOD, as that there can in no wise bee remission so fully obtained, but that needes their sinne must be punnished: and this being found in that sinne of <hi>Elie,</hi> maketh it a plaine matter to all, that such as haue the charge of others doe grieuously offend God, if they doe not with iust seueritie chastice such misdemeanor in them; though otherwise they bee as affectionate to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, as louing Parents are to their children. To finde out in what sort <hi>Elie</hi> did take it, we had neede first to marke in what sort it came to his knowledge: then, how patiently he did digest it. We are therefore the rather to marke in what sort it came to his knowledge, for that we doe not find, that God willed the Boy to carry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny such word to his Master; and the matter was of that nature, that the Boy of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe was not like to haue done it, if he might haue chosen: but yet, that God so orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <note place="margin">1. Sam. 3: 4-9.</note> the matter, that needs it must come to his knowledge; in such sort calling on the Boy, that he still running vnto his Master, his Master must needs at the length perceiue that it was the Lord, and so that the Lord would say somewhat vnto him. A course of that kind, as that it seemeth God was disposed therein to vse both mercy, and iustice: mercy, in that againe he putteth him in mind what iudgments were towards him; Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, in that he would not seeme, himselfe himselfe to haue any thing to do with him now, after that once before he had sent him warning, and he, as it seemeth, made but smal recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of it. And we must take heed, if at any time it please God to vouchsafe vs a war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, that wee doe not so vse the matter, as that thereby we giue him occasion, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> to speake vnto vs againe. But he being holpen so farre as he was, easily came to the knowledge of it: earnestly charging the Boy to tell him what the Lord had saide vnto him; and to conceale no part of it. Wherevpon the Boy, though of himselfe <note place="margin">Ibid. 16, 17.</note> hee did not before goe to his Master to tell him of it; yet now hee imparted all vnto <note place="margin">Ibid. 15. Ibid. 18.</note> him: leauing a good example behinde him, not onely to children vnder obedience, to tell the truth when they are asked, though in such case, as themselues would bee loath to doe it; but also, to all others besides, as the case oftimes falleth out betwixt the neerest friends that are. In <hi>Elias</hi> patient digesting of it, we are to note two spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial points: and those first as they may be taken seuerally; then, as they are ioyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. As they may be taken seueraly, we find, that first he acknowledgeth it is the Lord: then he yeeldeth himselfe and his to be dealt withall as pleaseth him. As they are ioyned together, they giue vs this lesson, that wee must first haue it setled in vs, <note place="margin">Ibid. 18.</note> that all such things come of God, before wee can quietly take them: but after that once we can feelingly say, it is the Lord, then is there nothing so hard or geeuous, but that we can (in some little measure) dispose our selues patiently to beare it so well as we can. In the knowledge here of that is attributed vnto the people, we are first to consider, what kinde of knowledge it was that heere is spoken of: then, to admonish of a little mistaking that seemeth to bee in the deliuery of it. The knowledge that here is spoken of, seemeth not only a bare knowledge, but to cary an acknowledging withal: as a thing not only let into them from God, but also proceeding from them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine towards God and men, which kinde of knowledge is absolutely needfull for al the people of God, as touching those that are sent vnto them, that so they do make some good vse of them, which otherwise they wuld certainely misse: euen as many of that peculier people of God did in the time of Christ &amp; his Apostles, neuer knowing (with any sensible feeling) who Christ and his Apostles were, though otherwise they could not but know that they were of God, by those workes that themselues did see they did before them. As touching the mistaking that I speake of, wheras this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that the people are saide to haue of him, is in two places noted, one towards the end of the third Chapter, the other in the beginning of the fourth, in the latter <note place="margin">Ibid. 19, 20, Ibid. 4: 1.</note> of these it is, that the mistaking that I speake of seemeth to bee: and it is no more

So first we are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider of the time of his gouernement: then, of his Story for the residue of his life en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing The time of his Gouernment how long it continued wee haue not set downe in the Story: but this is plaine, that part of the Story which is of his gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment doth stand by it selfe; and part of it mingleth with the Story of <hi>Saul.</hi> That part of the Story which standeth by it selfe, is the most part of it, for so long as <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel</hi> was able in his person to gouerne: but some part of it, when as for age he was faine to take other helpe vnto him. For so long as <hi>Samuell</hi> was able to gouerne, we haue but these two things set downe vnto vs: one in what sort he beganne to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne among them; the other what was the course that after he held. In that part of the Story, that sheweth in what sort he began, it shall be good to note, first how hee dealt with the people themselues: then, how hee dealt against the <hi>Philistims</hi> their enemies. He dealt with the people themselues, twice; first, as it seemeth, at <hi>Ramah</hi> (for there was his house, and there for the most part, he iudged <hi>Israel);</hi> then <note place="margin">1. Sam. 7: 17.</note> at <hi>Mizpah.</hi> In that which he did, as it seemeth, in <hi>Ramah,</hi> we first haue the occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on set downe: then, what he thervpon did. The occasion was that the people see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/>
               <note place="margin">Ibid. 2.</note> the hand of God so strong against them, beganne now more soundly to enter into the consideration of their former wayes, to be sorry for them, and to seeke vnto the Lord. In that which <hi>Samuel</hi> did heerevpon, we are to note, that something he did for the present, time: and something for a time ensuing. In that which hee did for the time present we are to consider, not onely what was done by him; but also, what effect it tooke with them. That which was done by him, was, that first he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted them, if truely they turned vnto the Lord, to put away the strange Gods from among them; and truely to giue themselues vnto the seruice of God alone: <note place="margin">Ibid. 3. Ibid. 4.</note> and then assured them, that so doing, God would deliuer them out of the hands of the <hi>Philistims.</hi> In that which he did for a time ensuing, wee are to note, not onely what it was that he did: but also what may seeme to be his meaning therein. That which he did was no more, but that now he appointed a generall assembly of all the people at <hi>Mizpah,</hi> and promised withall that he would pray for them. What his <note place="margin">Ibid. 5.</note> meaning was hereing we haue not set downe: but it seemeth, that vpon this repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the people, he conceiued good hope (if he were not some way or other by God assured) that now God would send some helpe to the people. For hee could not be ignorant, but that vpon that their assembly, the <hi>Philistims</hi> would come in vpon them: and so it was to good purpose, that hee willed all the people there to assemble, that so if it pleased God to giue them any hand against their enemies, they might be ready to take vnto them the benefit of it. In that which was done at <hi>Miz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pah,</hi> we are likewise to note, first what occasion was there giuen him: then, how farre himselfe dealt with them therein. The occasion that there was giuen him, was, <note place="margin">Ibid. 6.</note> that the people being there assembled did in speciall good manner bewayle that they had so sore offended. That which he thervpon did, was that then (as it seemeth) he took vpon him the gouernment of them, or did more fully buckle himself vnto it.
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:7530:144"/> In which respect, I thinke it not amisse, to take some heede to that Parenthesis of foure verses together, to frame them to a former time passed before: which <hi>Treme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi>
               <note place="margin">1585. 1593.</note> and <hi>Iunius</hi> before had vsed, and <hi>Iunius</hi> by himselfe hath taken backe since, and is not vsed by any others that I doe know. In his dealing against the <hi>Philistims</hi> theyr Enemies, wee may likewise note; first, what it was: then, of what effect it was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them. To finde out what it was, we haue first set downe, how hee was oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casioned to doe as hee did: then, what it was that so he did. Occasioned he was, first by the <hi>Philistims:</hi> then by his owne people. By the <hi>Philistims</hi> hee was occasio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, <note place="margin">Ibid. 7, 10.</note>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> for that so soone as they heard the people of <hi>Israell</hi> were so assembled together at <hi>Mispeh,</hi> the Princes of the <hi>Philistims</hi> came in with their forces, to the great dismaying and terrifying of the people, ouer whom they had exercised theyr tyrranny so long: by his owne people likewise, both by that theyr great feare; and for that <note place="margin">Ibid. 8.</note> they called so earnestly on him to pray to God for them, that he would saue them out of the handes of the <hi>Philistims.</hi> That which so hee did, consisted in two spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall pointes: one, his offering; the other, his Prayer. His offering was an whole <note place="margin">Ibid. 9.</note> Burnt-offering, yeelding all vnto the Lorde, reseruing nothing vnto themselues. His Prayer was, an earnest crying vnto the Lorde. The effect it tooke, was first aboue: then, beneath. Aboue, that God heard him: and from thence thundered <note place="margin">Ibid. 9, 10.</note> on the <hi>Philistims.</hi> Beneath, first for that praesent: then for the time ensuying. For that praesent, that they were thereby scattered: and the heartes of the people so rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed <note place="margin">Ibid. 10, 11, 13. Ibid. 12-14.</note> vp against them, that they pursued vpon them, slewe many of them, and brought them vnder. For the time ensuing, <hi>Samuell</hi> to Gods glory erected a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument for memorie of it: and the <hi>Philistims</hi> so found the hand of GOD a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them for <hi>Samuels</hi> time, that so long as hee had the gouernment, they came in no more against the <hi>Israelites;</hi> and besides that, restored vnto them such Cittyes as they had taken away from them before. In the course that after hee helde, the most that we read of, is about ciuill gouernment onely: but one thing there is, that respecteth Religion. In that which is about ciuill gouernment, it seemeth to mee, that as wee haue one thing of speciall good comfort plainelie set downe: so haue wee another that boadeth not well, which is but implyed. That which is of speciall good comfort, and is plainely set downe, is, that hauing thus begunne his gouernment, and beeing thereby established in it towardes the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, hee tooke such order for hearing and determining their Controuersies, and to see that order were euery where obserued among them, and put himselfe to such paines withall to ease the people therein, that, by all likely-hood▪ the people had for those matters a speciall good blessing by him. For though hee resided and dwelt <note place="margin">Ibid. 16, 17.</note> for the most part in one place himselfe: yet did hee euery yeare personally repaire to those others also, so to administer Iustice vnto them to theyr least trouble. That which boadeth ill, and is but implyed, is that which ariseth out of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of the places, of which hee made choyce wherein to minister Iustice vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> them. For whereas the Land lyeth long-wise, from the South towardes the North, as it were three partes of it on the West of <hi>Iordan,</hi> and but a fourth part on the East (yet both of a length, and to the length of <hi>Iordan</hi> it selfe;) and the length of it is some-what more, than twice and a halfe the breadth of it: hence it might seeme, that those places which <hi>Samuell</hi> made his choyce of, for the aforesaid administration of Iustice, were such as stood most fit and indifferent to such pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose; especially hauing an example before him from God himselfe, in the Cittyes <note place="margin">Deut. 4: 41-43. Ios. 20: 1-9.</note> of refuge that were so placed, three on the one side of <hi>Iordan,</hi> and three on the other. And because all those were <hi>Leuiticall</hi> citties, that is, into the which the <hi>Leuites</hi> among others were sorted, and because offenders were like to be there, therefore it seemeth, that these also had beene the meetest to such a purpose: for that beeing <hi>Leuiticall,</hi> there might they haue had, if at any time neede should haue beene, a more perfect knowledge (at least, by all likelihood) of the Law of God; and men-slayers hauing liberty to fly thither, and being vnder protection there, till they might come to indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent triall, those Citties were as like to haue worke for Iudges as most of the others. But now these Citties that hee made choyce of to this purpose, were onely in the
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:7530:144"/> West part of the Land, and none of them in the East; and not beeing cast to the length of it neither, but ouerthwart towardes the midst of it, and almost in a right line to (speak of) from the East to the West. For <hi>Ramah</hi> where he dwelt was in the <note place="margin">Christi. Adri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chom. in Theat. sanct.</note> vtmost part of the Land in a manner on the West, and so was <hi>Gilgal</hi> on the East; the other two were in a manner right betwixt them (sauing that <hi>Mospah</hi> stood a little more towardes the South) and in much like distance one from another; as <hi>Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pah</hi> from <hi>Ramah,</hi> and <hi>Bethel</hi> from <hi>Gilgall.</hi> And so did this line leaue to the South, almost all <hi>Beniamin, Iudah</hi> wholly (vnlesse it were the very edge of it, and that <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Adrichom. in trib. Ephra. num.</hi> 79.</note> but in one place onely) and both the others, <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Dan:</hi> to the North, almost all <hi>Ephraim,</hi> the one halfe of <hi>Manasses,</hi> all <hi>Issachar, Zabulon, Asser,</hi> and <hi>Neph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thalie;</hi> besides those other portions of <hi>Ruben, Gad,</hi> and the halfe of <hi>Manasses</hi> on the East. Out of which may this doubt (in my minde) bee conceiued, if <hi>Samuell</hi> were so industryous as it seemeth hee was, that much of the Countrey was growne halfe wilde, when as the administration of Iustice did spread foorth no farther, but kept it selfe so neere to the heart of the Land as it did.

But on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther side, if wee marke that opinion well, wee may soone finde, that it hath no good agreement, eyther with the situation of those places, or with the Text it selfe. As touching the situation of those places, <hi>Mispah</hi> was neyther in the midst of the Land, as touching the length, but had twice so much North-ward, as it had towards <note place="margin">Chr. Adrichom.</note> the South: neyther was it in the edge of the Land towardes the West, but that <hi>Ramah,</hi> one of the foure, and where <hi>Samuell</hi> himselfe dwelt, a great deale more Westmerly than it. Againe, whereas <hi>Mispah</hi> standeth as it were a fourth part or more of the breadth of the Land from <hi>Ramah</hi> East-ward, and <hi>Kiriath-jarim,</hi> is but a little way from it (a great deale neerer than <hi>Mispah</hi> and <hi>Ramah</hi> are) by that reckoning it should come to passe, that <hi>Samuell</hi> had taken three places, all towards the West, where the <hi>Philistims</hi> and the Sea did quickly inclose them: and but one towards the East, where besides so much of the breadth of the Land as thence they had betwixt them and <hi>Iordan,</hi> they had a great part of the people beyonde. <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> As touching the Text, they relye but on two places cheefely, <hi>Gilgall</hi> and <hi>Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pah,</hi> and yet in the Text it is cleere, that hee iudged <hi>Israell</hi> in <hi>Ramah</hi> by Name, <note place="margin">1. Sam. 7: 16.</note> and in all those foure places before named; and that themselues haue translated, not in <hi>Those two</hi> (whereon notwithstanding they chiefely relye, as before I sayde) but in <hi>All those places,</hi> as also the Originall it selfe requireth they shoulde. That <note place="margin">Ibid. 17.</note> which respecteth Religion, is, that hee built an Altar there vnto the Lorde: an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted token of some kind of deuotion in him; and that hee would ioyne toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ciuill gouernment, and Religion towardes GOD. But whether it was law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for him so to doe (as hee is by all that I doe knowe defended in it, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <note place="margin">Lyr.

When for his age hee was faine to take other helpe vnto him, hauing two Sonnes, hee made them Iudges in <hi>Israell:</hi> but they did not followe the good wayes of their Father, but <note place="margin">1 Sam. 8: 1-3</note>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="M"/> beeing worldly minded, they tooke rewardes and peruerted Iudgement. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it shall bee good to marke something, as touching the matter it selfe: and some-thing as touching the manner of deliuering the same vnto vs. In the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it selfe, some thinges there are to bee considered in them, as there was some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation betwixt their Father and them: and one thing besides in themselues, without
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:7530:145"/> respect of such relation. As there was some relation betwixt their Father and them, it may well bee, that the Father had some priuate respect in appointing them rather than others: and wee see, they did degenerate. If he had any such priuate respect, it came so much more iustly vppon him, that, for their degenerating from his better wales, himselfe was soone after by the people (in some sort) reiected, and that whole forme of gouernment with him: especially, hauing in his old Mayster so fresh an example of the Lordes indignation against the loosenesse of his two Sonnes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore remembred. In that they did so plainely degenerate, both wee see it often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed, that good Parents haue ill children: and it doth not onely serue to shew, that the good guifts of God doe not go by any naturall propagation; but also we finde it well recompenced oft-times, when bad Parentes leaue vs so blessed Children. In themselues, without respect of such relation, it is good to note, howe the desire of worldly lucre, or taking of rewardes (one of the branches of it) and corruption of iudgement or peruerting of right, are ioyned together: as teaching vs to gather, not onely that so it was in them now, but that we neuer finde it otherwise, but that so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as hunt after lucre or take reward, whatsoeuer good guiftes they may seeme to haue, or howe closely soeuer they carry it, the truth notwithstanding is, that iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is by them corrupted. In the manner of deliuering the same vnto vs, it is spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially said, that these were Iudges in <hi>Beersheba:</hi> which is a Citty in the vtmost part of the Land Southward, and towardes the West corner of it, in the Tribe of <hi>Simeon;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Adrichom.</note> and so a strange matter, that they should bee appointed to minister Iustice vnto the people, and yet reside in one remote corner of all the Land. Vnto this diuers say nothing at all: others there be, that doe otherwise gather thereof, one imputing it a <note place="margin">Lyr. Vatab. Bibl. Angl. Con. Pel.</note> fault vnto them, that would be so chargeable and troublesome vnto the people, as to make them traile so farre to haue their matters decided (and that indeede is the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of diuers, when they are in such place to take their owne pleasure or case; and little to regard, how the people wring for the same;) others accounting it a defectiue <note place="margin">

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="N"/> as not meaning thereby, that they did reside or lye onely in <hi>Beersheba,</hi> but that they were appointed ouer all, euen to <hi>Beersheba.</hi> And true it is, both that the Text here doth say they were appointed Iudges to <hi>Israell,</hi> and so to the whole people, and not vnto some one part only: and that such description of the whole people, as to say from <hi>Dan</hi> to <hi>Beersheba,</hi> is not vsed onely in that place of the Iudges, but in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other places besides.

In which meane time, first we haue but a treaty of hauing a King, at large: then, what course was held particularly about him that was now appointed vnto them. While it went no farther, but onely to bee a treaty of hauing a King, at large, wee are first to consider of it, as it was but onely mooued: then, as it was more importunately demaunded, and resolutely determined with them. As it was but onely mooued, we are first to consider how it was mooued by them: then how that motion was disliked by others. As it was mooued by them, we are first to consider of the occasion of it: then, of the motion it selfe. The oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion arose of two principall heades: one, the same that themselues doe alleadge; another, wherewith a little after <hi>Samuell</hi> doth charge them. That which themselues did alleadge, was, the ill gouernment of those that were in place already: a matter that <note place="margin">1. Sam. 8: 5.</note> oft-times is the cause of great alteration in states, &amp; somtimes of the vtter ouerthrow of them for euer. That wherewith <hi>Samuell</hi> a little after doth charge thē, was, that they <note place="margin">1. Sam. 12: 12.</note> did of the feare that they had of the King of the <hi>Ammonites</hi> then warring on cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of them. In the motion it selfe, wee haue both the substance, and manner of it. The substance is, that needes they would haue a King as other Nations had. In the manner of it wee haue two speciall pointes: one, commendable; the other, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooueable. Commendable it was, that they would not set vp any of themselues: <note place="margin">Ibid. 5.</note>
               <pb n="269" facs="tcp:7530:145"/> but referred themselues to the Prophet therein, whom they knew to be a faithfull ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="O"/> of God. Reproueable it was, that among all the company, euen of the Elders <note place="margin">Ibid. 4, 5.</note> of them, there were none that holpe to stay the rest in this matter, but all ioyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in it. But so it is oft-times in the Church of God, that euen all the Elders, (none of them excepted) ioyne together in that which they should not, none of them all hauing the grace to moderate the vnbridled waies of the rest. Misliked it was, first by <hi>Samuell:</hi> then also, by God. <hi>Samuell,</hi> being offended at it, did also make his prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er <note place="margin">Ibid. 6. Ibid. 7-9.</note> to God. God tolde him, that it was himselfe, and not <hi>Samuell,</hi> whom thereby they refused to rule ouer them: yet neuerthelesse willed him to yeeld it vnto them. In what sense God so said, we may vnderstand by the like speech that we had of <hi>Gedeon</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iud. 8: 22, 23.</note> before: and so not needfull to be repeated heere againe. To finde out howe it was afterward notwithstanding more importunately demaunded, and resolutely determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with them, wee haue first set downe, what cause they had to haue moderated themselues better than so: then, how importunate they are notwithstanding. Good cause they had to haue moderated themselues better than so, both in this that is gone before: and in more that followeth after. This that is gone before, is, that both <note place="margin">1. Sam. 8: 6-8.</note>
               <hi>Samuell</hi> was displeased at it: and that God accounted it to bee a reiecting of him to raigne ouer them; and a branch of the wonted Apostasie of their rebellious forefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers before. Enough to haue stayed such as had any moderation in them. That more which followeth after, was in that message that God heereuppon sent them by <hi>Samuel,</hi> the effect whereof rested in two principall pointes: one, that Kinges would vse so hard a gouernment ouer them, as that themselues should then cry vnto God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it; the other, that God would not then help them in it. The hardnesse of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment that they would vse ouer them, they are forwarned should partly but touch their earthle estate heere: but partly matters of greater importance. In such things as belonged to their earthly estate here, they would be giuen so freely to take at their owne pleasure, from any of their people whatsoeuer themselues listed, that they would not onely take of their best thinges, and dearest vnto them, as their Sons and <note place="margin">1. Sam. 8: 10-14, 16.</note> Daughters; and their ground whereon they should liue; yea, and the best of it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so: but euen their Seruants, and Cattle too. Those other matters of greater im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, are, the glory of God, and good of the people, spiritually in their transito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry life heere, aeternally in the World to come. All which depended much on the maintenance of the <hi>Leuites</hi> among them, which God appointed to bee by the tenth of all their encrease. Concerning which, God doth now tell them, that lightly they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="P"/> can haue no Princes, though neuer so much they professe themselues to be of God, and to haue speciall regard vnto him, and to the good estate of their people, but that yet notwithstanding beeing men, and thereby subiect to the common corruption of mans nature, euen that naturall inclination in them, once beeing armed with the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of authority, will make them so bold with those thinges aforesaide: and neuer in wisedome perceiue, neither of themselues nor by the wisest Sages they haue <note place="margin">Ibid. 15. 17.</note> about them, that they are wrong, nor that therein they worke against God and their people themselues, and all. An vsurpation so praegnant with vs, that no honest heart I thinke but would be ashamed, euen in the darke, of diuers thinges of that kinde, that we notwithstanding haue done in the light, euen in this brightnesse of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell it selfe: and altogether neglecting the glory of God; iniurious, and hurtfull, in the highest degree, to all his people. Which hard estate (into which heereby they were to fall) although it were hard enough in it selfe, and thereby sufficient to haue giuen them warning; yet was it made so much the harder, in that God doth nowe so <note place="margin">Ibid. 18.</note> plainely tell them before, that when they should call vnto him for helpe therein, hee would in no wise helpe them in it: a good warning as possibly might be, beeing so plainely before-hand giuen them. All which notwithstanding the people are where they were before: needes must they haue a Vice-gerent, where (they saw) their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne <note place="margin">Ibid. 19, 20.</note> himselfe euer resided; needes must they be abased like other Nations, whom God had (euen therein also) aduanced, aboue all the peoples of the World. Which <note place="margin">Ibid. 21, 22.</note> when <hi>Samuell</hi> had related vnto the Lord, and the Lord had willed him againe to let them so haue it, sith needes they would, and the Prophet thereon had willed them,

In that course that was now particulerly helde, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Q"/> about him that in the end was appointed vnto them, because yet we must keepe but vnto the Story of <hi>Samuels</hi> Gouernement, and that it must end when <hi>Saule</hi> beginneth his Kingdome, therefore are we more precisely to marke, where we may most fitly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count the reigne of <hi>Saul</hi> to begin, that so wee may the better see, where to finish the Gouernment of <hi>Samuel.</hi> This we haue not any where in my iudgement so plainly set downe, but that where I thinke we may best account it, yet there doe I wish it rather to be but thought most likely, than to make any certainty of it. And that seemeth to me to be when it is saide, that all the people went to <hi>Gilgall,</hi> and there made <hi>Saule</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Sam. 11: 15</note> King before the Lord: and so, that neyther it beganne so soone, as when he went to <hi>Iabes-Gilead</hi> against the <hi>Ammonites;</hi> neither was it so long before it beganne, as <note place="margin">Ibid. 7-11. Ibid. 10: 8. 13: 8.</note> vntill <hi>Samuel</hi> should come at the time appointed to <hi>Gilgal,</hi> and there shew him what to doe, For the former of these was but accidentary, or by occasion, as the present necessitie then required: and in the latter of them it seemeth, that <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel</hi> was rather to doe the worke of a Prophet, than of a Gouernour, for which <hi>Saul</hi> was then to attend him; especially being made by all the people King before, euen by the direction of <hi>Samuel</hi> himselfe. This therefore beeing our compasse, <note place="margin">Ibid. 11▪ 14.</note> now we are to see, what we haue in this meane time that may be allotted to the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment of <hi>Samuel,</hi> that now doth mingle with the Story of <hi>Saul.</hi> Within which compasse, something we find to be done at <hi>Ramah,</hi> where hee dwelt and now was: and something at other places besides. At <hi>Ramah</hi> it was, where first he vnderstood who it was whom God would haue now to bee appointed King ouer his people. Concerning which, first we haue deliuered how it was dispatched heere: then, how closely the principall party kept it at home when hee came there. It was in such sort deliuered heere, that therein we haue a good example, how the prouidence of God (whensoeuer himselfe is so disposed) by small things leadeth vnto matters of speciall moment: and that it may be an example vnto vs insteede of many, to that end (it seemeth) it is particularly set downe vnto vs. Wherein we haue declared, how it pleased God, when he was disposed to bring <hi>Saul</hi> to the Kingdome, to vse certaine meanes whereby to worke: first of inferiour creatures; then also of men. Those inferiour creatures by whom it pleased God now to worke, were poore seely Asses: and his working by them was, that they must goe astray, and for a time bee <note place="margin">1. Sam 9: 3.</note> wanting vnto the owners of them. The men by whom it pleased him to worke, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="R"/> were most of them such as imployed themselues about those lesse matters: but one of them was of more speciall reckoning, and reserued to bee imployed about grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Those who imployed themselues about those lesse matters, were <hi>Cis</hi> or <hi>Kish</hi> the father, whose Asses they were: and <hi>Saul</hi> his Sonne, together with one of his seruants, that must goe seeke them. Of <hi>Cis</hi> it is saide, that he was a man of good account among his people the Tribe of <hi>Beniamin:</hi> and that hauing his Asses stray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <note place="margin">Ibid. 1, 2, 3,</note> he sent both his Sonne and one of his seruants to seeke them. Of <hi>Saul</hi> and that seruant, that accordingly they sough: them in diuers places, but could not find them <note place="margin">Ibid. 4-14. 18-20.</note> and that by occasion thereof seeking to <hi>Samuel,</hi> there they find the end of their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour; and in much more comfortable maner, than they could looke for. And true it is, that often it pleaseth God, to make such inferiour creatures, yea and the losse and wanting of them, and our owne imployments about them, speciall good means of some greater workes of his prouidence towards vs: and so likewise all other earthly things whatsoeuer; and all the imployments of men about them. But here it shall be good more specially to note, what is recorded of those two words, the Prophet and <hi>Seer:</hi> and in what sort <hi>Saule</hi> and his man at this time came vnto <hi>Samu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el.</hi> As touching the former, first it is cleare, that such as professe themselues to bee <note place="margin">Ibid 9.</note>
               <pb n="271" facs="tcp:7530:146"/> Prophets, or to be in such place with the people now, as these Prophets were with the people then, should by ancient right be Seers: and therefore ought so to order themselues, not onely that they haue no beames nor grosse moats in their own eies; but also, that no distemperature in them do so much as troble or darken their sight. Then also, whereas the word <hi>Prophet</hi> is not an Hebrew, but a Greeke word by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, though it be vsed much in translations, not onely in the Greek, but also in the Latine: yet haue the Hebrewes their owne propper word for a Prophet, and haue still vsed the same. Insomuch, that whosoeuer will marke it, may easily find, that euen the last Prophets of all, as <hi>Haggai, Zachary,</hi> and <hi>Malachy,</hi> (the last Bookes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so of the Old-Testament, and so of the vse of that tongue in the scriptures) though often they haue occasion to vse that word (especially the middlemost of them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the longest) yet they neuer vse but onely their owne: at that time hauing no conuersing at all with the <hi>Grecians,</hi> as after they had. In the maner that <hi>Saul</hi> &amp; his <note place="margin">Ibid. 5. 8, 10.</note> man vsed to come to the Prophet, it seemeth they thought much baslier of him, than they should haue done: &amp; yet in some measure acknowledged their duty notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing. They thoght ouer basely of him, if they conceiued of him, but as of such as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="S"/> we cal wisemen, as able to tel of things lost as it seemeth they did, &amp; sure it is, that euen the best seruant of God among vs, is oft-times little better thought on by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the vulgar people; and their helpe to such purpose oftener sought, than in those better, for which chiefely they are sent vnto them. Their duty notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in some sort they acknowledged, in that they would not go empty vnto him: and yet hauing beene their chiefe Gouernour so long as now hee had beene, they could not conceiue that he was in any such neede, as that they needed to present him with such a trifle. We not onely haue no such regard to any of those Seruants of God that we know so to be fleeced (if our selues also haue not done it) that needs they must be in poore estate (so farre are we from such presenting of any such as we know to haue plentie, though otherwise the seruants of God neuer so much:) but also prey vpon them stil, so oft as we are able to conceiue any hope of any thing yet to be gotten from them; and so farre are wee from shaming with it, that with an Harlots fore-head we daily follow it more and more. He that was of more special reckoning, and reserued to bee employed about greater matters, was <hi>Samuel</hi> the Prophet: and those greater matters wherunto he was reserued, were some of them now already past when <hi>Saule</hi> came to him; and some of them, soone after ensuing. Already past were two: one, that God tolde him the day before, that the next day <note place="margin">Ibid. 15, 16.</note> he would bring him in the man whom he should anoint to be King ouer <hi>Israel:</hi> the other, that being come at the time appointed, in the sight of <hi>Samuel,</hi> he told him, <note place="margin">Ibid. 17.</note> that that was the man that he did speak of. Those that ensued, were of two sorts: one, but such as <hi>Saule</hi> himselfe and his seruant might in reason haue expected; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, much more, than were within the reach of their expectation. That which they in reason might haue expected (in that reckoning that they made of him) was to vnderstand something of those Asses that they did seeke for; which also they did: namely, that both he tolde them that himselfe was the Seer, and what time <note place="margin">Ibid. 19, 20.</note> those Asses were lost; and willed him not to care any more for them, for that they were already found. Those others that were much more than within the reach of their expectation, were partly no more, but onely some speciall and extraordinarie curtesie; but chieflie such others as more properly belonged vnto the busines that was now most intended. It was speciall and extraordinarie curtesie, that he &amp; his <note place="margin">Idid. 19, 22-24.</note> seruant were taken in to feast with those that were then gathered together: especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally being so placed, and in such sort vsed, as then they were. Such as did more properly belong vnto the businesse that was now most intended, were, that first he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="T"/> gaue him but an inkling of it: but then went directly and plainly vnto it. When he gaue him but an inkling of it, that seemed to be in the presence and hearing of his man: but when he went more directly and plainely vnto it, that was but priuately done to himselfe. Again, when he gaue him but an inkling <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 span">

               </gap> because <hi>Saul</hi> gaue some answere vnto it, therefore are we to consider, not onely what <hi>Samuel</hi> did say vnto him, but also what was the answere that <hi>Saul</hi> did giue him. <hi>Samuell,</hi> hauing
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:7530:147"/> tolde him that the Asses were found, and hauing willed him not to care for them, now by that occasion farther telleth him, that himselfe was now growing to be (and, <note place="margin">

The answere that <hi>Saul</hi> did thereunto giue him, was in effect, that the Tribe whereof he came, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">Ibid. 21.</note> the least of all the Tribes of <hi>Israel;</hi> and his Fathers familie, one of the meanest of all that Tribe) there was no reason why he should vse any such speech vnto him, or but put him in any such hope. Before the time of our knowledge that <hi>Samuel</hi> went plainely vnto it, we finde that he talked priuately with him: but of what matter wee <note place="margin">Ibid. 25, 26. Ibid. 27-10: 13.</note> cannot tell, sauing that it was most likely to be of this. But bringing him a peece of his way, and causing him to send his man a little before him, then he tolde him the the whole matter, and gaue him good tokens of it, God also confirming the same, and <hi>Saul</hi> himselfe finding those tokens to fall out as it was told him before that they should. But these things would be more specially considered: both what was heere done vnto <hi>Saul;</hi> and what himselfe did afterward finde. That which heere was done vnto him, was partly by <hi>Samuell:</hi> and partly by God. By <hi>Samuel</hi> hee was dealt-with most of all for this present: partly also for another time after ensuing. For this present, both he imparted the matter vnto him: and confirmed him in it. He imparted the matter vnto him, when he tolde him, that the Lord had appointed him <note place="margin">Ibid. 10: 1.</note> to be gouernour ouer his inheritance. He confirmed him therein, first by that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="V"/> which then he did vnto him: then by that which then he told him. That which hee did vnto him, was, that he did annoint him to the Kingdome: that is, powred vpon <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> him a viol of oyle of sweet perfume (such as in those parts many did vse) in assurance that God had appointed him, and would likewise enable him to gouerne his people. Which his annoynting, being a figure of the annoynting of Christ, doth teach vs, that he is both appointed and enabled to be our Sauiour: and that, if he be appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, we should not in dutie goe to any other; as also, that we need not, if he bee ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled. He told him of diuers good tokens to confirme him therein: first in others; then, in himselfe. Of others, that he should meete some but ciuilly, others religiously imployed. Ciuilly those two at the sepulchre of <hi>Rachell,</hi> that should tell him, that the <note place="margin">Ibid. 2.</note> Asses were found, and that his father now sorrowed for them: religiously those three <note place="margin">Ibid. 3, 4. Ibid. 5.</note> that were going vp to God, with their presents with them; and those Prophets with instruments of Musicke and Prophesying. The token that should be in himselfe, was that the Spirit of God should come vpon him also, so that hee should Prophecy and become a new man, and might then doe as occasion should serue. For another ttme <note place="margin">Ibid 6, 7.</note> then ensuing, hee now instructeth him what to doe against that time: namely that whereas they were shorly after to haue a generall assembly at <hi>Gilgal,</hi> hee also must <note place="margin">Ibid. 8.</note> be there, and abide the comming of the Prophet seuen dayes, til he come and shew him what to doe. That which God did heere vnto him, was, that when <hi>Samuel</hi> and <hi>Saul</hi> were parted, then did God giue a new heart vnto <hi>Saul,</hi> or such vertues and graces as were meete for the function wherevnto now he was called. That which <note place="margin">

The principall party that was thus set forth, was <hi>Saul,</hi> who returning home againe, was specially <note place="margin">Ibid. 10-13. Ibid. 14-16.</note> questioned withal by his Vncle of that his businesse: but <hi>Saul</hi> imparted nothing vnto him as touching the kingdome. A speciall good token of the modestie of <hi>Saul,</hi> that hee neither made any vaunt of it when hee came home: nor, though his Vncle by likelyhood were a man that some way or other might helpe it forward, yet did he not seeke his helpe therein. Those other places besides were two: one, <hi>Mizpah;</hi> the other, <hi>Gilgal.</hi> That which was done at <hi>Mizpah,</hi> had some part of the complement of it a while after at <hi>Iabesh Gilead.</hi> So are wee first to consider of that which was doe at <hi>Mizpah:</hi> then, of that farther complement, soone after en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing. In that which was done at <hi>Mizpah,</hi> we are first to consider of the course of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="W"/> proceeding that t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>e was vsed: then, how the assembly was againe dismissed. The course of proceeding that there was vsed, was, that then hee was first made knowne to all the people generally, to be the man that God had appointed to bee
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:7530:147"/> their King: and that the people were diuersly affected towards him. So are we first to consider, how hee was so farre foorth made knowne vnto them: then, howe the people were affected towardes him. Hee was so farre foorth made knowne vnto them, partly by his election: and partly, by bringing him foorth in person before them. When they goe vnto his election, <hi>Samuel,</hi> hauing gathered the people to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, <note place="margin">Ibid. 17.</note> first reprooueth them for giuing him occasion of that businesse: but then ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthelesse doth set in hand with it. His reproofe was, in the name of the Lord: and <note place="margin">Ibid. 18, 19.</note> it chargeth them, that whereas hee from time to time had deliuered them from all their enemies; yet that now, in effect, they did cast off him, in demanding a King to raigne ouer them. Setting in hand with the businesse it selfe, there both hee and <hi>Saul</hi> might see (for these were priuie to his annointing before) how wonderfully the Lord disposeth euen of Lots; a thing of as meere casualty, as can be conceiued: and this might they see, first in that wherein we see, what the oddes was; then also, in the residue of that businesse, wherein it is not knowne vnto vs what the oddes were. For first we see, that of all the Tribes of <hi>Israel,</hi> the Tribe of <hi>Beniamin</hi> was taken: and <note place="margin">Ibid. 20.</note> there the oddes were, eleauen to one. How many were the seueral Families of that Tribe; then also, how many were the seuerall persons of that family whereof <hi>Saule</hi> was, are both vnknowne vnto vs: but how many, or how few soeuer they were, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that family whereof <hi>Saule</hi> was; and of all the persons thereunto appertaining, it <note place="margin">Ibid. 21.</note> was <hi>Saule</hi> only that so was chosen. As touching the bringing of him foorth in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son before them, he was so farre from awaiting of his election, and of being in a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinesse then to take the aduantage of it (as ambitious aspyring persons are woont to be) that being priuy to his annointing before, and thereby conceiuing how the lots <note place="margin">Ibid. 21-24.</note> were like to fall, he went aside out of the way, and so was hid til they enquired of the Lord concerning him, and so vnderstood where to haue him: whether when they went and brought him among them, both themselues did see, that he was a man of goodly personage, higher by the head than the rest of the people; and <hi>Samuel</hi> tooke occasion thereby to commend him vnto them. The people for the most part were <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="X"/> well affected towards him: but some were not. Those that were well affected to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him, were the most part generally: and some, in particular. Generally, the <note place="margin">Ibid. 24.</note> most part reioyced in him, and desired God to blesse him. In particular, both there were diuers that now began to attend him (but a thing to be noted, none in this his <note place="margin">Ibid. 26.</note> simple beginning, as also in the first rising of the Gospell, but such as whose heartes <note place="margin">Ibid. 27.</note> God had touched:) and others, it seemeth, of the ablest sort, brought presents vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him. Those that were not so well affected towards him, stumbled, it seemeth at the meanes of his estate now at the first (as diuers haue done at the Gospell also) and <note place="margin">Ibid 27.</note> thereupon despised him; and brought him no presents: but it is to be noted withall, that they haue a speciall burne set vpon them for the same (a thing that may be found in ours too) namely, that those were wicked men, or of the worst sort among them. As touching the dismissing of the assembly, <hi>Samuell</hi> first both by word of mouth did <note place="margin">Ibid. 25.</note> shew them what should be the manner of their estate now, both for their allegiance vnto their King, and for his authority ouer them againe, and set the same downe in writing also, and laide it vp before the Lord: and then dismissed the whole assembly, sending them all away to their owne. The complement that this businesse had in <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>besh-Gilead,</hi> was, that then all the people generally agreed to make him K. ouer them; but as it were by certaine degrees: partly by the good successe that it pleased God to giue then vnto him against certaine of their enemies; and partly, by the aduise of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muell.</hi> What that good successe was, that it pleased God to giue him against cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of their enemies, to the end we may the better perceiue, we are first to consider of such things as went before, then, of that good successe it selfe that immediatly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed.

               <hi>Saule</hi> thereupon set in hand to helpe them. Those ill tidings came by the meanes, that when the Inhabitants of <hi>Iabosh Gilead,</hi> could get no other conditions, and were <note place="margin">Ibid. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Whereupon <hi>Saul</hi> comming out of the fields, not yet taking vpon him as King, but onely liuing as a priuate man, was now notwithstanding so netled at this, that presently he stroke downe a yoak of Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, cut them in peeces, sent the peeces abroade among the people, and gaue them plainly to vnderstand (the spirit of God being now more specially come vpon him) that whosoeuer followed not to that seruice, himselfe and <hi>Samuell</hi> going before, their Oxen should bee in such sort serued. Vpon which God stroke such a feare in the <note place="margin">Ibid. 7-11.</note> hearts of the people, in this case to yeeld their obedience, that there assembled togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the <hi>Israelites</hi> 300000. and of the Tribe of <hi>Iudah</hi> onely 30000. all which hee diuided into three companies, and set vpon the enemy betimes in the morning. The successe was, that he so ouer-threw them, fighting against them till the heate of the <note place="margin">Ibid. 11.</note> day, that most of them, it seemeth, fell in that place by the sword, and the rest that remained were so scaled or scattered, that scantly two of them were any where left together. By which their good successe, they came thus farre of their owne accord <note place="margin">Ibid. 12, 13.</note> at the first, that they would haue had those now put to death, who had despised him before: but that <hi>Saule</hi> himselfe stayed them therein, because the Lord had that day vouchsafed them so faire an hand against their enemies. The aduise that <hi>Samuel</hi> gaue <note place="margin">Ibid. 14.</note> them, was to go to <hi>Gilgal,</hi> and there to renew the kingdome, or againe to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge their allegiance vnto him, when as God had wrought in such sort by him, as that it was most likely, that none would now haue the face or heart to make any que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion of it, as diuers of them before had done: and this aduise of his wrought so well with them, that by that which followed soone after thereupon, it appeareth, that now they were resolued so to do.

               <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> each other, euen all the people in their King, and their King in them, that on both sides their ioy was exceeding great. That other of <hi>Samuels</hi> we haue more largely described vnto vs, and two principall matters therein: one, as touching his own for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer gouernment among them; the other, as touching that alteration that now they had made. As touching his owne former gouernment among them, whereas in his time they had made this alteration, to cleere himselfe of the suspition that hee did giue them no occasion vnto it, he willeth them to say before the Lorde, and his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed <note place="margin">1. Sam. 12: 1-5.</note> there present, if euer he had abused his authority among them, to the hurt or wrong of any of them, or to raise any base aduantage vnto himselfe. Of all which they did then cleere him so very well, that therein he left a very good example, both to him that was then there to succeede among them, and to all other Gouernors what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer. As touching that alteration that now they had made, he first laboreth them to vnderstand their fault therein: and then, vpon their yeelding thereto, doth readily minister comfort vnto them. Hee laboureth them to finde their fault in seeking to haue that alteration, first by their former experience of the Lord: then also, by an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary worke, that then he would do before their eyes. Their former experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence <note place="margin">Ibid. 6-15.</note> was, that he did euer readily helpe them when they stood in neede, and sought
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:7530:148"/> vnto him: so that now they had no such need to haue done as they did; and yet, that if they would now keep to the Lord, they needed not to doubt, but that he would stil be gracious vnto them, though otherwise they might look for no other, but that his hand would be against them. That extraordinary work that he would now do before their <note place="margin">Ibid. 16-18.</note> eies, was, that suddaine storme of thunder &amp; raine, that at the praier of <hi>Samuel</hi> he then did send them, to be an assured signe vnto them, that therein they had offended the Lord. Wherupon when the people yeelded themselues guilty, then he ministreth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort vnto them: assuring them, that the Lord will not faile them, if they truly cleaue vnto him; and yet that otherwise both themselues and their K. are sure to perish. His Story, for the residue of his time ensuing, is most of it, of his life: but somewhat of his death. So much of it as is of his life, we may diuide into two principal parts: some part of it being of such his imploiments, as after that <hi>Saul</hi> took vpon him as K. and before it pleased God to shew what his purpose was towards <hi>Dauid,</hi> we do find recorded of him; the residue, of such as were likewise in the time of <hi>Saul,</hi> but yet then beginning <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A. 2"/> when it pleased God to make known vnto others, what his purpose was concerning <hi>Dauid.</hi> Such as were of the former sort, were some of them such, as where about Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets are ordinarily imploied; but one there is of that nature, as wherabout Prophets are but seldome imploied. Those that were of such nature, as where-about Prophets are vsually imploied, were, one of them at <hi>Sauls</hi> first entrance into his kingdome: and the others, a while after. At <hi>Sauls</hi> first entrance into his kingdome, <hi>Samuel,</hi> as a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, <note place="margin">1 Sam. 13: 11-15.</note> both reproued his inordinate hast: denounced vnto him the losse of his kingdom for the same. A while after he was again as a Prophet imploied, to direct the K. how to <note place="margin">Ibid. 15: 1-3. Ibid. 10-23.</note> deale against the <hi>Amalachites:</hi> and, at his returne, to reproue him likewise, for that he had no better regarded the charge that was giuen him; and, for that againe, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce <note place="margin">Ibid. 24-31</note> vnto him the losse of his kingdome, at which time notwithstanding as a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect he easily yeelded himselfe to be ouer-ruled to attend the King before the people. That which is of such nature as about which Prophets are sildome imploied, was, that he called for <hi>Agag</hi> the King of the <hi>Ammalekites,</hi> whom <hi>Saul</hi> and the people brought <note place="margin">Ibid. 32, 33.</note> home aliue, &amp; there did hew him in pieces before the Lord in <hi>Gilgal:</hi> but then went home, and was sorry that God had reiected <hi>Saul,</hi> and mourned for him. Of the latter <note place="margin">Ibid. 34. 35</note> sort we haue but onely two, and both of them such, as are wont to bee done by the Prophets: one, that he went at Gods commaundement to <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> and there an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed <note place="margin">Ibid. 16: 1-13.</note>
               <hi>Dauid</hi> to be King ouer <hi>Israel;</hi> the other, that with <hi>Dauid</hi> when he fled from <hi>Saul,</hi> he went to <hi>Naioth</hi> to abide there, and there did hold the exercise of Prophecy. <note place="margin">Ibid 18, 20. 24. Ibid. 25▪ 1.</note> That which is of his death, is no more but this, that he died, and that all <hi>Israell</hi> assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled themselues, and mourned for him, and buried him where he dwelt, at <hi>Ramath.</hi>

For neither do we tarry till we be so perfectly instructed in the will of God, by such as it pleaseth him to vse towards vs, especially if we haue but halfe so good cause a little to hasten, as <hi>Saule</hi> then had: neither do we, in any matter of charge that lightly we haue (vnlesse it be in the case of <hi>Iehu,</hi> for our safety withall, for that the destruction of <hi>Achabs</hi> House, in <note place="margin">2. King. 10. 30</note> plaine reason must he think to be the better confirming of him in his) goe so neere to fulfill that which God prescribeth vnto vs, as wee may see that <hi>Saule</hi> then did in the charge to him prescribed. But these things will better appeare in the Story it selfe. His entrance therefore in such sort he made, one way or other, as that God was therewith offended, and <hi>Saul</hi> for the same sharply reproued. So are we first to consider, wherein <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> he offended in that his first entrance: then, how he was for it reprooued. To find out wherein he then offended, is so much the harder, because it is not in such sort descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, but that it is diuersly taken: and albeit the opinions be but two, and that speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all consideration hath bin had by the learned of either of them, yet in my mind it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth they haue left (euen in that which is the likeliest) a good peece of their mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter behind them. In the former of these two opinions wee are to consider; first, what the same opinion is: then, what our selues may gather out of it, if that may stand for the sense of the place.

If that were his fault, and that the Prophet for it did first denounce vnto him the losse of his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, or that it should not nowe abide to him and his, then had wee neede to take heede of a praesupposed liberty that many of vs haue vsed, and some yet do: Lay-folk, yea, Women, to Baptize Children in time of necessity. Concerning which, it shall bee good, first to consider of it, as if there were some vrgent necessity in it so to doe: then to examine, whether there be any such necessity indeed, or not. If there were some vrgent necessity in it, so to do, yet so was it in <hi>Sauls</hi> case also. For the <hi>Philistims</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ibid. 5-8.</note> were already come in very strong; many of the people hid themselues in Caues, and fled ouer <hi>Iordan;</hi> such as <hi>Saule</hi> had gathered together and followed him, began to steale away a-pace likewise; and <hi>Saul</hi> had stayed (in a manner, full out) seauen dayes already. All which notwithstanding, if the Lord would not in that case beare with him, it is hard to conceiue, that in this case of ours, he will beare with vs. But now the truth is, there is no such neede in this case of ours to driue vs vnto it: but, on the other side, much good matter to hold vs off from it. That there is no such need in this case of ours to driue vs vnto it, may reasonable plainely appeare; first, in it selfe: then also, in others like vnto it. The thing it selfe being Baptizme, doth easily shew vs there is no such necessity, both by the very nature of it: and by the vse of it in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient time in the Church of God. The nature of it is to giue vs to vnderstand, that the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Children of those Congregations that doe professe the Faith of Christ, do appertaine to the kingdome of God, as much as themselues; not onely when they are come into the world, but also euen in their Mothers wombes: and therefore, that for Baptisme, the outward testification of it, we need no more but onely to take heed, that neyther wilfully we do refuse it; nor negligently slip the time to take it, when we may conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently <note place="margin">

<pb n="277" facs="tcp:7530:149"/> that they had of olde no such doubt of those that departed before Baptisme. Those others that are like vnto it, are, Circumcision vnder the Law: and the holy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion in the dayes of the Gospell. Circumcision, by the appointment of God, was not to be ministred vntill the childe was eight dayes olde: before which time it is not to be conceiued, but that many departed; and yet was not their estate therefore to be doubted. The holy Communion we doo not hold needfull nor meete neither to bee ministred to any of our children at all, vntill they come to yeares of discretion; before which time it is certain, that many depart this life: yet God forbid that they should be any thing at all endangered thereby; as it seemeth men were of olde perswaded, when so farre as well they could, they haue ministred <note place="margin">

By the thing it selfe, I meane that bold vsurpation aforesaid, when women or other Lay-people take vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them to baptize (in a Church established) when they conceiue need to require. For the opinion of that presupposed liberty, hath hatched another misvsage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, discomfortable to parents, vnseemly and dangerous vnto themselues: name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that when children are stil-borne, or dye before they are baptized, the women that are present, being fore-stalled with a preiudice already, that such children do not appertaine to the kingdom of God, send them or carry them away to be buried in some odde corner, as not meete to come to Christian buriall. A very vnaduised part, to make themselues so heauy Iudges on those silly Infants, whom they were neuer able to charge with any ill, not onely in deede or word outwardly, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so not so much as with any ill thought within. If it be compared with others, then what letteth, but that if they may minister Baptisme when they think there is some vrgent necessity, they may likewise vpon any such like praesupposed necessity, mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister the holy Communion likewise, take the pulpit, meddle with any inferiour Magistracy, yea and finger the Scepter too?

               </note> that to be fault, what we are to gather out of the same. His fault was, as these others do take it, that he did not await the Prophets comming, but began so farre to enter into his businesse before, whereas euen therein also he should haue stayed the Prophets comming, as he had before appointed; though as it now fell out, the Prophet had tarried altogether as long in a manner, as he had required the King to stay for him; and because the King in his answere, when he was reproued, giueth in nothing else in particular that he had done, but onely that, to make sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication to the Lord, he had offered that Burnt offering, therefore go they no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther neither, and so do leaue, as I do take it, a great pecce of their matter behinde them. Which that we may the better perceiue, we are to take in (as I do take it) all the Text of this Chapter going before: and, to that end, first to cleere it in one point of the translation; then, to consider of the whole matter therein contained. That one point of the translation that is first to bee cleared, is the first part of the <note place="margin">1. Sam. 13: 1. <hi>Iran. Vatab. Bibl. Angl.</hi> 1594.</note> first Verse of this Chapter, where it is saide, that <hi>Now Saule had bin King one yeare:</hi> which is not so to be taken, as though the Originall could yeelde no other Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation; but that such as did so interpret, thoght that to be most agreeable vnto it, though they knew others to bee otherwise perswaded therein. But this doo I thinke cannot be the meaning of the place; but rather, that the beginning of the first yeare of <hi>Saules</hi> raigne is noted thereby, as there be others that so do take it: <note place="margin">Tremel. Iun.</note> or, that when <hi>Saule</hi> came first to his kingdome, he was of a quiet, gentle, &amp; milde disposition, and as farre from any haughty or hard wayes, as a little sucking child, <note place="margin">Chald. Paraphr Conrad. Pell.</note> or a child of a yeare old, as others do giue the meaning of it. For either of these do very well agree with the Story or residue of the Text: but not the other, so far as I am able to gather, because that so it would fall out, that <hi>Samuell</hi> had adiour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the King to an assembly that should haue beene a tweluemonth after, and had willed him then also to stay on him there (at least seuen dayes) till he should come thither vnto him. Whereas notwithstanding <hi>Samuel</hi> himselfe perceiued, that <note place="margin">1. Sam. 12: 12.</note> they were so vrgent then for a King, vpon a present occasion then offered: <hi>Nabash</hi>
               <pb n="278" facs="tcp:7530:150"/> then comming against them, which could not haue brooked so large a delay. The matter in the first nine verses of this Chapter contained, is not onely of that his hast to get the Burnt-offering to bee made, but of diuers other thinges besides, which are, as I take it, a part of his fault likewise: though I graunt, there be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that seemeth to stand somewhat hard against it. So are wee now, first to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> set downe, what we take his fault to haue been: then, what we haue to say to that which doth seeme to stand somewhat hard against it. His fault it seemeth was (as before is said) not onely his not tarrying of <hi>Samuel</hi> in that his offering, but withal, that so he had prouoked the <hi>Philistims</hi> to come in vpon them, both him-selfe and his sonne <hi>Ionathan</hi> withall: himselfe by gathering those forces vnto him, and by <note place="margin">1. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>▪ and his sonne <hi>Ianathan,</hi> by encountering that gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison that he then dealt with. That which may seeme to stand some-what harde against this, resteth in two principall points: one, a place of the Text it selfe; ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther an interpretation onely. That place of the Text it selfe, is, that when <hi>Samu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el</hi> at his annointing had tolde him of certaine Tokens, he should finde in his way homeward, for his farther confirmation, and among others, that the Spirit of the Lord should come vpon him, he then bad him do as occasion should serue, &amp; told him that the Lord was with him. So it may seeme, that by vertue thereof, hee <note place="margin">1. Sam. 10: 7.</note> might now gather such forces together, and so stirre vp the people to armes as hee did: and that <hi>Ionathan</hi> (vnder him) might so assay that garrison also, as now he had done. But it seemeth, that that liberty was giuen him but in respect of that prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent occasion that was then so instant vpon them, the invasion of the <hi>Ammonites:</hi> and that the abiding of him that he did require at <hi>Gilgal,</hi> did necessarily imply with it, not to prouoke the <hi>Philistims,</hi> who yet were quiet; and by whose comming in, (when they were prouoked) he found himselfe as it were surprised, from staying on the Prophets comming. And how could these two in any good construction stand together, that <hi>Saule</hi> must tarry the time and place appointed, to be farther inuested in his kingdome by <hi>Samuel,</hi> before he might take vpon him as King (but only for that present occasion, so very vrgent as then it was:) and yet, in the meane season, vnprouoked might gather such forces vnto him, might so imploy certain of them, and so generally send the Alarum to al the people? These things indeed are apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to Princes: but not absolutely, vntil they be in ful possession. That which is but onely an interpretation, is another vnseasonable Praeterplu perfect-tense (as I do take it) and a sense accordingly framed, that by some of our best Expositers <note place="margin">

Sam. 13: 2.</note> there is vsed: making those forces that <hi>Saul</hi> had now gathered togither out of the rest, and then sending home the rest againe to bee none others but those, that of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> their owne accord (yet inwardly gouerned by God vnto it) gaue their attendance on him when they say, that by lot he was so chosen to be their King; and concey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing withall, that when <hi>Saule</hi> went against the <hi>Ammonites,</hi> he left those with <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nathan</hi> to attend the garrisons of the <hi>Philistims.</hi> But besides that that is without warrant, the Text it selfe seemeth rather to note, that these were others, &amp; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise <note place="margin">Ibid. 2.</note> employed also about the king or vnder his regiment, and in other places with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all. This being his fault, and then we being to see what wee are to gather out of the same, the matter is plaine enough of it selfe, that seeing hee was so readye, in these things himself to be doing, &amp; did not so praecisely await the time apointed, as he was by the Prophet inioyned; &amp; yet was so loath to take it vpon him before: by very good reason may we doubt, that we in such case are oftimes in our affairs ouer hasty also, &amp; do not so precisely heed the rules that are giuen vs, as we ought to do; especially in all such matters as whereunto our selues are so readily enclined. In the reproofe, that for this was giuen him, it appeareth, euen at the first, that it was very sharpe: &amp; yet who so looketh more specially into it, shall finde it much shar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, than otherwise it appeareth to be. It appeareth euen at the first to bee verie sharpe, not onely for that the words of the reproofe are so round as they are: but <note place="margin">Ibid. 13, 14.</note> also, because the losse of his kingdome is thereby likewise denounced vnto him. If we looke into it more specially, it doth then more plainly appear, partly because it was so long first, before hee would any thing at all take vppon him: and partlie,
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:7530:150"/> because when hee did some-what that way, hee had such prouocation thereto at hee had. Hee had great occasion to haue taken much vppon before, at his first returne from <hi>Ramah:</hi> but then much more, on his beeing at <hi>Mispeh.</hi> At <hi>Ramath</hi> he was both specially honoured at the Feast; and by the Prophet <hi>Samuell</hi>

At <hi>Mispeh</hi> hee was chosen King by <hi>Lot,</hi> euen he of all the thousands of <hi>Israell:</hi> as also, both of most of the people acknowledged; and of diuers of them attended. When now hee did take so much vpon him, as to make choyce of three thousand men, two thousand vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his owne regiment, and one vnder <hi>Ionathans;</hi> warned the people also, to betake <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> themselues to Armes; and at that time stayed the Prophet so long as he did, as his occasions were then: in reason wee might thinke him notably prouoked thereunto, not onely in that so many of the people came so readily at his commaund to attend him against the <hi>Ammonites,</hi> three hundred and thirty thousand; but also for that <note place="margin">Ibid. 11: 8.</note> both he had so great successe there against his Enemies that hee gaue them a great o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrow, and wan such fauour of all his Army, that there they acknowledged their <note place="margin">Ibid. 12.</note> alleagiance vnto him more than before. All which notwithstanding, medling so farre as now he did, before the Prophet came and fully possest him of his kingdome, albeit he had such cause to bee doing before, and that <hi>Samuell</hi> tarryed so long; and although his modesty and humility were such, that it was long before hee would bee seene, in that matter of his so great aduancement: the Prophet telleth him, hee hath doone foolishly (O the wonderfull depth of Gods seueritie;) he hath not kept the <note place="margin">Ibid. 13: 13, 14.</note> Commaundement of the Lorde his God; it must cost him no lesse than his Scepter and Crowne for thus farre transgrssing, euen the first charge that was giuen him. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther yet was hee any of the <hi>Leuites,</hi> more specially brought vp in the knowledge of God; but at the most, as a young Gentleman of an ordinary education: neyther were those daies themselues such, as that any speciall acquaintance with the wayes of God, might bee expected in men much liklier than hee. And yet euen for this one slip of his, in an estate that he would faine haue shunned, and when hee had so great reason (as we should thinke) to doe as he did, is he now irreparably of God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected. But a notable warning it is vnto vs, in all our waies to reuerence the holie direction of God; and neuer to make so bold there-with, as in any thing to goe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it; howe iustly soeuer our selues might conceiue wee were occasioned: and withall, a notable burne to all those profane waies of Popish deuotion, that, so they be doing, doe very little or nothing regard, what it is that God, by the direction of his holy word, would haue them to doe.</p>

In their want of prouision to such pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, we are not onely to marke, howe it was at that time with them: but then, to come to our selues likewise, and to see if we haue not beene in like case also. How it was at that time with them, is plaine enough in it selfe: namely, that the <hi>Philistims</hi> had so prouided, that the people of <hi>Israell</hi> neyther had any Weapons meete for the <note place="margin">Ibid. 19: 22.</note> Warre among them, as Swordes or Speares; neyther any Artificers to make them any. Insomuch that they were faine to goe downe to the <hi>Philistims,</hi> to beate out or mend euen their Instruments of Husbandry that were of Iron, as their Mattockes, Coulters, and Shares: and were themselues allowed but a File at home, to mend or sharpen any of them. And this they did with so speciall regard, that about this time when <hi>Saul</hi> numbred the people that drew vnto him, euen then, as it seemeth, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared this want, that none of all the company had either Sword or Speare, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the King himselfe and <hi>Ionathan</hi> his eldest Sonne: and yet the whole company was then as it seemeth but poore sixe hundred. That our selues haue beene in the like <note place="margin">Ibid. 15. 14▪ 2.</note> case also, vnder our late <hi>Philistims</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> is altogether as plaine as was the other. For they also had so prouided, that they had left no word of God among vs that we might be able to vnderstand, neither the Old-Testament, nor the New, neither the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Articles of our Faith, nor the Ten-Commaundements, nor the Lordes-Prayer: and had so clean taken away men of skil from among vs, that we were of necessity driuen to goe down to their Forges, euen to <hi>Dunse</hi> and <hi>Dorbell,</hi> for whatsoeuer such things we needed; the Clergy they left vs, being so weake to any such purpose, that scantlie might they be for those matters so much as in stead of a File vnto vs, and that but a very meane one too. Rare men also they were, and those but few, that in spirituall Weapons were any better prouided among vs. They haue told vs since, that they did it but onely for our good, that the Scriptures are hard and dangerous, and for that onely cause they tooke them away, that we should take no hurt by them. But if the question be set vpon those other <hi>Philistims,</hi> what the cause was why they did so carefully keep the Children of <hi>Israell</hi> from such Weapons, whether that the <hi>Israelites</hi> might take no hurt by them, or that themselues might more easily keepe them vnder the yoake of their bondage still: euen that onely I thinke would bee sufficient, to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure vs of the inward purpose and meaning of these our <hi>Philistims</hi> also. By <hi>Ionathan</hi> was occasioned, partly their comming in: but especially, that the <hi>Israelites</hi> so pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued on them, as soone after they did. Their comming in was partly occasioned by him, for that his Father hauing giuen him the charge of a thousand men, his fingers <note place="margin">Ibid. 3.</note> were itching, he could not be quiet, till hee had a little pulled the Feathers of one of the <hi>Philistims</hi> Garrisons among them. That soone after the <hi>Israelites</hi> had the heart &amp; stomack to pursue the <hi>Philictims</hi> so as they did, was likewise occasioned by him: being by some speciall and extraordinary motion resolued himselfe and his Seruant to begin the fray vppon the <hi>Philistims;</hi> and God so seconding him therein, that the <note place="margin">Ibid. 14: 1, 4-15.</note> maine Army of the <hi>Philistims,</hi> and those three bands, were all discouraged and fled, and so gaue occasion vnto the <hi>Israelites</hi> to come foorth and to follow. To finde out how it was heere on performed, heere it shall bee good, to part the maine businesse, from certaine particular accidents that came in withall. The maine businesse was, how they shifted with the <hi>Philistims</hi> now, wherein that God may haue his due, who onely it was that brought thinges so well about on behalfe of the <hi>Israelites,</hi> it shall bee good to note, in what tearmes the Children of <hi>Israell</hi> at that praesent stood, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they saw how they were occasioned to plucke vp their hearts and to follow after: and then, when they saw what occasion was giuen, how they did follow indeede.

               </gap> was carefull to haue doone▪ that seruice thoroughly; and wise to praeuent that which might haue defeated it cleane. The people fell to their victuals so greedily when they came at them, that by some of <note place="margin">Ibid. 32, 33.</note>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> the company they were reported to haue eaten the blood withall, plainly forbidden by the Lawe of God: and himselfe was like enough to haue beene the chiefe cause of making himselfe that businesse, by so strickt forbidding vnto them to take any victuals before. And yet because hee was so very loath that they shoulde therein <note place="margin">Ibid. 33, 34.</note> offend, it may not iustly bee denied vnto him, but that therein hee was very care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to haue the Lawe of GOD duly obserued: which also did otherwise partly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare in that there hee builded an Altar vnto the Lorde. At which time also the <note place="margin">Ibid. 35.</note> people gaue a very good testimony of their obedience to the kings commandement, in that they did so truely obey, being as it were offered vnto them as they went by: <note place="margin">Ibid. 25-27. Ibid. 28-30.</note> and none but <hi>Ionathas</hi> (who heard not of it) did meddle with it; nor hee but little, though he was of opinion, that it was some hinderance vnto the seruice that his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had so praclaimed. In those that belonged to another peece of seruice soone after intended, wee are first to consider what was that seruice: and then, what acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents they were that fell out thereupon. The seruice intended was to follow vpon the Enemy that night, and to make an hand vppon them the best that they coulde. Which when <hi>Saule</hi> had propounded, they all were willing, sauing that the <note place="margin">Ibid. 36, 37.</note> Priest wished the King first to enquire of the Lord: which when hee did, it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed not the Lorde to giue any answere thereto. The accidents that fell out there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uppon, were diuers: one, what the King himselfe conceiued thereon; others, what course hae tooke to doe such iustice, as he thought in that case was meet to be done. The King himselfe conceiued, that there was some speciall fault by some of them committed, because the Lord gaue no answere then vnto him: whereas notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding there might be other reasons conceiued, why the Lord gaue no answere now: For it may be the Lord did not like of any farther prosecuting of them, as yet: and then; in reason ought that to content him and the rest, that they did not finde the Lord to approue it; the law already hauing set downe generally, that wee ought to <note place="margin">Deut. 4: 2. 12: 32.</note> doe nothing but onely that which the Lord hath commanded. Againe, when first
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:7530:152"/> he heard there was some tumult and businesse in the enemies campe, though at the <note place="margin">1. Sam. 14: 16-19.</note> first he was then in hand to inquire of the Lord about that matter: yet perceiuing the tumult to waxe greater, and belike thinking it no time then to tarry, hee bad the Priest stay, and did not tarry to make inquirye. It may be therefore that he that would <note place="margin">Exod. 13: 1, 2. Mal. 1: 8, 13, 14.</note> euer be serued with the first and best of all that wee haue (and meete that he should) would haue nothing to do with the end of this action now, seeing he was not sought vnto in the beginning. A matter not much vnlike herevnto we afterward haue, that hath the like answere in effect: that whereas the people in the captiuitie had taken <note place="margin">Zac. 7: 1-6.</note> vp two fasting dayes of themselues, but after made conscience to breake them when the Temple was builded and the Land inhabited againe, vnlesse the Lord should first approue it, he told them in effect, that seeing it was but their owne doing at the first, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> he would haue no dealing with it now. Neuerthelesse it was not farre amisse, that so he conceiued (being as it is so cleare a matter, that euer it may be iustly doubted, being all so full of sinne as we are); and his errour therein, was no more but this, that although it were not vnlikely so to bee, yet had hee no warrant, that so it was. But <note place="margin">1. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 word">

As touching his inquiry, first, it was to find out the offender: then the offence which was committed. In searching to find out the offender, first he resolueth to vse the Lot: but then hee ioyneth prayer withall. In that he so vseth the <hi>Lot,</hi> therein againe we haue a commendable readines and indifferency in him, making his choice so to do it, and exempting neither his Son nor himselfe from the tryall thereof.

It seemeth indeed, that himselfe was chosen by Lot: but so would the Lord con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitme vnto him the annointing he had of the Prophet before. Most likely also that he knew the Land to bee diuided by Lot before: as also it may bee hee had read or heard, that when <hi>Achan</hi> had secretly sinned, he was in such sort found out and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished. But the Lord himselfe had so appointed for the diuision of the Land: and what course soeuer was held; both for the finding out of <hi>Achan,</hi> and for his owne e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection (both which may seeme to be by Lot also) certaine it is, by the plaine Text, it was of the Lord, or his appointment. And so oft as it is his owne appointment there is no doubt, but that himselfe will order the same accordingly: as also wee are after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward plainely told that so he doth. Againe, in this tryall, he did disaduantage him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe and his Sonne together very much in plaine sight, in that hee did not take such course as in that case was vsed, first beginning with the Tribes which were eleuen to one, and then to come first to the families of that Tribe that should be taken, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the seuerall persons that were of that family, both which are vncertaine what oddes they would yeeld: and so if needes he would put it to that kinde of tryall, yet by that order might he haue had many on whom the Lot might haue fallen in euery <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> of those degrees aforesaide; whereas in this course he neuer left but two parts only, all the people and them two at the first, then but himselfe and his Sonne at the second in which case needs must it fall, either on the one or on the other. His Prayer was, that God would direct the Lots aright: which whether God were disposed to do or <note place="margin">1. Sam. 24: 41</note> not, (or which seemeth the more likely of the two) whether God espying inconside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate dealing in him, were disposed to punish that, wee haue it not in plaine termes set downe; but onely thus much, that <hi>Ionathan</hi> was taken (as of necessity one of them <note place="margin">Ibid. 42.</note> must haue beene, there was no remedy). <hi>Ionathan</hi> being now detected for the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender as he did take it, he commeth to the other part of his inquiry, namely, what was the offence he had committed: and charging <hi>Ionathan</hi> to tell him the truth what he had done, thereby he found that he had in his hunger tasted a little wilde Honny as <note place="margin">Ibid. 43.</note> he went by, in pursuit of the enemy. In which confession or acknowledging of his
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:7530:152"/> fault, there be two principall poynts: one, that he plainely confesseth the matter; the other, implying, at least as it seemeth, more than he speaketh. In confessing the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter so plainely as he doth, it is somewhat strange, but that it seemeth the reuerence he had to his Father and to the Proclamation he made, doth make him yeeld that as a sinne, which otherwise was none. For it is no sinne, orderly to take meate when we are hungry; and it is noted before, that both he and the people fainted for want <note place="margin">Ibi. 24, 27▪30</note> of susteynance: and himselfe did not but orderly take it, because at the time when he tooke it, he knew not of any commaundement to the contrary; though being after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward aduertised of it, he now confesseth what he had done. That part of his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere that seemeth to imply more than he speaketh, is, when he addeth thereunto, that therefore he must dye: not in plaine termes contradicting his fathers mind ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; but yet in modest manner giuing him occasion to thinke better of it. And the thinges he may seeme to imply thereby the Text it selfe doth helpe vs to finde: one, that in his iudgement his father had not done so well, as the case was then, to giue <note place="margin">Ibid. 29. 30. Ibid. 27.</note> any such inhibition vnto them; the other, that himselfe, till afterward, did not know of it. An example so much more worthy the marking, as we are afterward to see, that the lesse <hi>Ionathan</hi> defended himselfe against his father: the better, it seemeth did God prouide for him by all the people. In his readinesse to doe such execution on his sonne as he had before protested, for whosoeuer it was that was the offender, wee haue one thing very commēdable: but some others, that seeme to argue some want in him then. That which was commendable in him, was that he had so speciall regard <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> to warlike discipline, that he would not spare his sonne therein. Those that seeme to argue some want in him then, were, that he seemed not to haue due regard, eyther <note place="margin">Ibid. 44</note> to the needlesnesse and inconueniency of his owne Prohibition: or, on <hi>Ionathans</hi> part, to his innocency in the cause it selfe; or by the blessing that by him God gaue vnto them in that peece of seruice. But as God would haue it (who is woont to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the innocent, and not alwayes to suffer men to runne so far as otherwise they would, in their owne vnaduised wayes) the people stood so fast with him, that <note place="margin">Ibid. 45, 46.</note>
               <hi>Ionathan</hi> tooke no hurt therby; especially for that it had pleased God to make him so speciall an instrument of that their diliuerance: and so <hi>Saul</hi> quietly returned, by all good likelyhood not long offended, that the people had so stayed him from precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating that his iudgement on his Sonne, in that his displeasure.</p>
            <p n="2">2 This peece of seruice being done on the suddain, and as occasion then was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> we are now to see, in what thinges he imployed himselfe at farther leysure, and more aduisement: and so may we finde, that some thinges he did, as it were of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe; and some other, by the speciall appointment of God. Such as he did, as it were, of himselfe, wee haue not set down but very briefly: and some of them, som-what doubtfully too. In those that are set downe but brieflie, something we haue about the conflicts that he praesently made: and something againe, about a kind of proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion he made for such other conflicts as might after ensue. As touching those that he presently made, some there are that haue the like report going on all: others, that doe something vary. Those that haue the like report, are all of forraine Enemies; but some of them somewhat farther off from them, as the <hi>Ammonites,</hi> and the King of <hi>Zobah,</hi> others neerer home, as the <hi>Edomites:</hi> and the like report that goeth of these, is, that <hi>Saule</hi> fought against them, and handled them like bad men, belike as <note place="margin">Ibid. 47.</note> noysome and grieuous enemies were to be handled. Those that haue their report som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing <note place="margin">Ibid. Ibid. 52.</note> varrying from the other, are those conflictes hee had with the <hi>Philistims,</hi> of whom it is not onely said as before of those others: but also, it is farther added, that <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> against them there was warre all his dayes. The prouision hee made for other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictes ensuing, was, that he made much of such men, as at any time hee found meete for the warres. Those that are somewhat doubtfull, are the conflicts he had with the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
               <hi>Ammonites</hi> and <hi>Amalekites:</hi> and the doubtfulnesse is, whether these bee no other <note place="margin">Ibid 47. 48. Ibid. 11: 11.</note> seruices but such as are other-wise noted; one of them before, the other, the next that immediatly after doth follow. For of those we may conceiue some doubt, es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially, of the latter of them, because others haue so conceiued: and then I see no <note place="margin">Trem. Iun.</note>
               <pb n="284" facs="tcp:7530:153"/> reason to the contrary, but that the selfe-same doubt may be as wel conceiued of the former too; because there is such a speciall discourse of such a peece of seruice before against the <hi>Ammonites,</hi> as immediately after against the <hi>Amalekites.</hi> And I doe see nothing to the contrary, but that all these that are so briefly named, may well bee <note place="margin">Ibid. 47.</note> others, than that of the <hi>Ammonites</hi> remembred before; and this of the <hi>Amalekites</hi> following after: especially, seeing it is plainely saide, that he warred against all his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies on euery side. So it seemeth to mee, that both those be taken as peculier conflicts that of himselfe he had with them as occasion serued, as he had with those others: and that they were besides those that otherwise are more specially described; the one before, the other after. For both of them had deserued ill of the <hi>Israelites,</hi>

Wherevpon it is not vnlikely but that <hi>Saul</hi> of himselfe might well be doing with these (as hauing in his mind to fight against all his enemies, of which sort these were none of the vnworthyest to bee remembred) before that God did specially send him against them, vtterly to destroy them. In which place, those also before named doe thinke very hardly of him too, when they are not able to charge him with ill, in any of the thinges that are heere rehearsed; as when after he imployed himselfe so much as he did in persecuting <hi>Dauid:</hi> a preiudice, in my minde, so much the more both vnaduised and vncharitable, as this place saith nothing of him but well; &amp; others there were before, who gathered much better of him then so, euen on the same place also, especially the middlemost of these, whose iudgements was, that all this time he did maruellous wel, &amp; afterward also, in some respect. By the speciall commandement of God was this expedition that next ensueth against the <hi>Amalekites:</hi> in which hee so offendeth the Lord againe, that now againe the losse of his kingdome is denounced vnto him, and much more grieuously then before. So are we in this to see, first what it was wherein he offended: then, what was denounced vnto him for the same. To finde out his offense, we are first to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> of the charge that was giuen him: then, how farre hee did discharge himselfe therein. In the charge that was giuen him we are first occasioned to consider of the person by whom the message was brought vnto him: then, to come to the mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage it selfe. The person by whom the message was brought him, was but a man no <note place="margin">1. Sam, 15: 1</note> more then himselfe: but yet knowne to be the seruant of God; and sent before to annoynt him King. As he therefore doth first require obedience of him, euen so are we to gather, that how meane soeuer the messenger be: yet if wee finde hee doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire but as the word of God doth direct him, we are to take heede, that we slip no part of the charge to vs committed. In the message it selfe, least the execution hee was to doe, might seeme vnto him to be somewhat too bloody, he first doth tell him the reason of it: then, what must be the execution. The reason of it was, that the Elders of the <hi>Amalekites</hi> (more than foure hundred yeeres before) had molested the <note place="margin">Ibid. 2.</note>
               <hi>Israelites</hi> the people of God, when being come out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> they were newly ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into the wildernesse. So grieuous a thing is it with God, if his people be by him molested; and though he beare with it long yet is it one time or other remembred: this example insinuating besides, that, as it is with vs, the higher we lift our hand to strike, the longer it is before it giueth the stroke it selfe, but striketh more surely when once it commeth; euen so, for the most part it is with God too, that the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger it is before that hee doe shew his displeasure against our sinne, the greater it is when once it falleth. The execution must be, to goe and destroy all that whole peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, man, woman, and child, together with their Cattle great and small: and to haue <note place="margin">Ibid. 3▪</note> no compassion on them. A wonderfull sentence to proceede from so mercifull and gracious a God: but thereby seruing so much the better, to shew that hee is seuere likewise; and that he vseth his great seuerity against those that are greeuous vnto his people. How far K. <hi>Saul</hi> did now discharge himselfe therin, to the end that we may more certainly find, we must first make no question of it, but that he was defectiue in it: but then we are to marke withal, how neere he came to his dutie therin. He was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectiue in it because hee and the people spared <hi>Agag</hi> the King, and the likelyest <note place="margin">Ibid. 8, 9</note> and best of their Cattle, and of other things also as it seemeth. Neuerthelesse, hee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
               <pb n="285" facs="tcp:7530:153"/> may be accounted to come somewhat neere, first for that he dealt so well with the <hi>Kenites</hi> who dwelt among them: then also, for that he did to the <hi>Amalekites.</hi> The <hi>Kenites</hi> he gently willed first to depart, because they and their elders had bin <note place="margin">Ibid. 6.</note> friendly vnto the <hi>Israelites;</hi> whereas otherwise it might easily be, that some of thē might fall by the sword among the rest: this also being the manner of God, neuer so to poure forth his wrath on the wicked, but that stil first he setteth those in safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, whom of his fauour he meaneth to saue. That which he did to the <hi>Amalekites</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ibid. 4, 5, 7, 9.</note> themselues, was, that he gathered conuenient forces, went against them, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed all the people with the edge of the sword, euen all the Countrey ouer as it seemeth: and all their Cattle and stuffe besides, that was of the meanest. For, <note place="margin">Ibid. 30. 1.</note> that shortly after we read of <hi>Amalekites</hi> yet remaining, in the spoyle of <hi>Ziglag,</hi> that may we rather take of those that by likely-hood fled out of the Country when the <hi>Israelites</hi> so farre preuailed, that they saw no hope to stande against them (as it is the manner of men in such case to do) than, as some doo take it, that <hi>Saule</hi> stroke <note place="margin">Trem.

Vnto that which was denounced vnto him for the same, there be some other factes appertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: so that first wee are to consider of that which is to him denounced; then, of those facts that belong vnto it. In that which is to him denounced, because it came from the Lord, therefore are we first to see what ground-worke it is that the Lord thereof hath laide: then, how the Prophet frameth his dealing accordingly. <note place="margin">1. Sam. 15: 10. 11.</note> The ground-worke that thereof the Lord laid, is that he giueth <hi>Samuel</hi> to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, that it repented him he had made <hi>Saul</hi> King (signifying thereby, that now he had greeuously offended, and that his determinate purpose was now to remoue him:) and the reason to be, for that heereby he had turned from him, and had not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> performed his commandements. The Prophet in framing his dealing according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, first bemoaneth the matter to God: then doth he goe and carry his heauie ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings to <hi>Saul.</hi> He bemoaneth the matter to God all that night, crying vnto the <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> Lord about it. A notable token, that if <hi>Samuel</hi> were a good man himselfe, <hi>Saule</hi> was not so il as many of vs take him, for that in such case <hi>Samuel</hi> would neuer haue lamented so much as he did, that God did so reiect him; and that his slippes were but such as God might finde in the best of vs all, if hee were disposed so to deale <note place="margin">1. Sam. 10: 22. Ibid. 11▪ 13. Ibid. 11: 7. 14: 47. Ibid. 14: 44. Ibid. 14: 52.</note> with vs: as also, his modesty in shunning the kingdom, his facility to forgiue those that were against him, his readinesse to make head against all their enemies, his speciall good regard that he had to military discipline, and to make much of such as were meete for seruice, were such things in him, as sildome were sound in other Princes. Comming towards <hi>Saul</hi> with his heauy tidinges, hee is for a while by <hi>Saul</hi> preuented, and held-off from doing his message: but by and by after, he doth readily discharge himselfe of it. He was held-off for a while, for that King <hi>Saule</hi> (hearing belike of the Prophets comming) came foorth a little to meete him: and <note place="margin">Ibid 25 12-15.</note> saluting him first when he came towards him, in very kinde and courteous manner, told him withal, that hee had rhoroughly done as the Lorde had bad him. But when <hi>Samuel</hi> then asked, whence that bleating of Sheepe, and lowing of Oxen was, that he then heard, he readly answered, that they were of the goodes of the <hi>Amalekites,</hi> but that the company thought good to reserue of the best of their cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, to offer in Sacrifice vnto the Lord, whom there he tearmed his God, meaning <note place="margin">Ibid. 16.</note> the Prophets (so insinuating that those were they that then they brought with them:) and added withall, that all the rest they had destroyed. This being said, the Prophet then being to discharge himselfe of his message, desireth leaue of the King to tel him, what the Lord that night had said vnto him concerning that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and that being obtained, he did set in hand to it: first but deliuering the mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage it selfe; but then winning the King to grant himselfe guilty. While he doth
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:7530:154"/> but delieur the message it selfe vnto the him, first hee putteth him in minde how God <note place="margin">Ibid. 17, 19.</note> out of his meane estate before, had now aduanced him to the height; and hauing called him thereunto, had nowe sent him on that late voyage: then hee asketh him, how it came to passe, that he did not obey the voyce of the Lord, but turned to the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> prey, and did wickedly in the fight of the Lord. He wan the King to graunt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe guilty by the communication that went betwixt them in those matters: and so are wee to see, first, what communication passed betwixt them for those matters; then, how the King did thereupon yeelde himselfe guilty, or that hee had indeede of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended. The communication that passed betwixt them for those matters, was some part of it the Kinges: and some the Prophets. The King sheweth, whereon he standeth, that in his iudgement he doth not deserue any such reproofe. First, for <note place="margin">Ibid. 20.</note> that himselfe had gone the way that the Lorde had sent him, and in token thereof, both had brought away the King himselfe, and had destroyed the rest of the people, and so, in his minde he had obeyed the voyce of the Lorde: then, for that it was but the people (not he) that tooke of the chiefe of those thinges that should haue been <note place="margin">Ibid. 21.</note> destroyed; and yet not they neyther, but to make Oblations thereof vnto the Lord, whom there againe hee tearmeth <hi>Samuels</hi> God. The Prophet sheweth him; first, how to finde his sinne: then also, his iudgement for it. His sinne hee sheweth him by comparison, giuing him to vnderstand, that praecisely to haue done as the Lorde <note place="margin">Ibid. 22.</note> had praescribed vnto him, had pleased the Lorde a great deale better, than all the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices they could offer vnto him: and, on the other side, to doe otherwise than God had enioyned (though themselues had no other meaning in it, than as they alleaged) <note place="margin">Ibid. 23.</note> was as bad before him, as was eyther Witch-craft, or Idolatry. His iudgement therefore (euen for sparing those that they spared, and though but to that ende ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) to be no lesse, than, because he thereby had cast away the word of the Lorde, <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> therefore the Lord did now cast away him also, from beeing King. Whereuppon <hi>Saul</hi> finding his sinne, dooth now plainely acknowledge the same, and sheweth that <note place="margin">Ibid. 24.</note> hee did it for feare of the people, rather obeying them than God: and withall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sireth <hi>Samuell,</hi> both to obtaine him pardon for it, and to come on forward with him <note place="margin">Ibid. 25.</note> to <hi>Gilgal</hi> where he was in hand now to worship. The actes that belonged heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, were some of them for this praesent: one, for a longer time ensuing. Those that were for this praesent, were some of them heere in the way as <hi>Samuell</hi> was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to <hi>Gilgal</hi> to the King, but that the King came foorth to meete him: others, at <hi>Gilgal</hi> it selfe. Such as were heere by the way, were betwixt <hi>Samuell</hi> and <hi>Saul: Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muell</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ibid. 26-31.</note> turning aside to leaue him, and giuing him some reason why so hee did: and <hi>Saul</hi> being so loath to part with him, that he tooke such hold on his Garment to stay him, that thereby he rent his garment, and so obtaining in the end, that the Prophet attended him to <hi>Gilgall,</hi> in the sight of the Elders and all the people. At <hi>Gilgal</hi> it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> selfe, one was done by <hi>Saul</hi> the King; another by <hi>Samuell</hi> the Prophet: both of them such, as might seeme rather to be wrong sorted. For one of them was the worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of God; and that had beene a seemely action for the Prophet: the other, the execution of <hi>Agag,</hi> which might haue becommed the King as well. But at this time it was the King, who worshipped: and the Prophet, who did the execution. In that the King worshipped, notwithstanding that he was so reprooued for that which <note place="margin">Ibid. 31.</note> he did, and had that sentence denounced against him, it is a very good token in him: whereas <hi>Kaine,</hi> on such occasion, turned a-side from the praesence of God; and <note place="margin">Gen. 4: 16.</note> fewe of the best of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

Otherwise, it had beene the likeliest for <hi>Samuell</hi> not to haue medled with it himselfe: to haue set <hi>Saul</hi> vnto it, so to haue amended something now, wherein he had so far offended before. And then had we neede also to take heede (so farre as to vs appertaineth) how wee vse any such Officers as we may see to be reiected of GOD: yea, or to put them in place at the first, till we see they are chosen of God. That one that was for a lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger time ensuing, was, that <hi>Samuell</hi> now gaue vp all attending of <hi>Saul</hi> (now that the <note place="margin">Ibid. 34, 35.</note> Lord had reiected him) going home, and comming vnto him no more so long as he liued: but yet notwithstanding still mourned for him (a token stil, that he tooke him not to be so bad a man, as many of vs sticke not to file him) though God neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse still aboad resolute in his reiection.</p>
            <p n="3">3 When the good spirit of God was taken from him, and an euill spirit was sent to vexe him, it was a pittifull course indeed, that thence-forward he held, euen to the end, closing vp his life also therin. So are we first to see, when that good spirit of God <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> was taken from him, and an euill sent to vex him: and then, what was his waies after. The time we find to haue beene, after that <hi>Dauid</hi> was appointed to succeed: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <note place="margin">1. Sam. 16: 14.</note> God first vsed the Ministery of the Prophet; but then wrought by himselfe, by &amp; by after. That which was done by the Ministery of the Prophet, was, that God first gaue order that so it should bee; then, that <hi>Samuell</hi> accordingly performed it vnto him. When God gaue order for that matter, he first reprooued <hi>Samuell</hi> for mourning so long for <hi>Saul,</hi> seeing he had cast him from regning ouer <hi>Israell:</hi> then he directeth him what to do for another. In that hee doth reproue him not simply for mourning <note place="margin">Ibid. 1.</note> for him, but that he mourned for him so long, and when he hath reiected him, it may wel teach vs, first that in such case we are allowed to mourne or sorrow: but then we are plainly taught withal, that finding it once to be the lords doing, that ought to stay our affections therein; at least in some reasonable time. The direction that hee gaue him for the other, was of two principal parts: first, for the substance of it; then for the manner of it. For the substance of it, he was to take an horne of oyle with him, and at <note place="margin">Ibid.</note>
               <hi>Bethlehem</hi> to annoint him one of the Sons of <hi>Ishay</hi> to succeed in the Kingdome. For the manner of it, there was no quaestion but for one point in it, which was for his safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in such an action: whereat when <hi>Samuell</hi> made some quaestion, God doth then di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect <note place="margin">Ibid. 2, 3.</note> him to make another arrant withall, vnder which that other businesse also may bee done without suspicion. In the performance of it some little difficulties went before: and then was the matter soone effected. Those difficulties were but onely the doubt of the Inhabitants conceiued of <hi>Samuels</hi> comming among them: &amp; that <hi>Ishay</hi> being to bring all his Sonnes before the Prophet, hee brought but the likeliest in his mind, vntill he was farther vrged vnto it. The doubt of his comming was soone clee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, <note place="margin">Ibid. 4, 5.</note> after that he told them he was come to sacrifice there: but therein may we note, that euen the sight of such as are of speciall note among vs, the neerer they drawe in such sort towardes vs, as if they were to haue some dealing with vs, vpon the sense of our owne guiltinesse, the more doe wee begin to startle. In that <hi>Ishay</hi> so rested on <note place="margin">Ibid. 6-12.</note> the likeliest, so did the Prophet himselfe likewise, till God kept him in suspense yet for another: and that is the manner of vs all, so to aesteeme of the likeliest in our minde, that oft-times wee cleane set by such as God himselfe hath chosen or most ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemeth. These difficulties beeing past, the party that should bee, was at length <note place="margin">Ibid. 12, 13.</note> brought in, and then God telling <hi>Samuell</hi> that that was he, he did then annoint him accordingly: and so returned homeward againe. The worke that was done by God <note place="margin">Ibid. 13, 14.</note> himselfe by and by after, was, that the good Spirit of God that departed from <hi>Saule,</hi> now came vpon <hi>Dauid,</hi> and from that day forward continued with him. What the waye, of <hi>Saul</hi> from this time were, for the most part we finde in the time of his life: but partly also euen in his death. Dealing but with the time of his life, the Story shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vs, that for a time he imploied himselfe reasonable wel in such thinges as to him appertained: but after, that he took a worse course, and held on that euen to his end.
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:7530:155"/> He imployed himselfe resonable well, both about his owne infirmity: and on behalfe of the people also.

               </gap>e thereby; then, as God had therein another meaning. As the King had no farther regard but to ease himselfe thereby, it was no more but this, that his seruants espying him now to be diuers times wrong, or out of <note place="margin">Ibid. 15-23.</note> tune by passionate fits, as they did perswade him, so did he readily yeeld to take <hi>Dauid</hi> vnto him, as one that was skilfull to handle an Instrument, so to ease him in those his passions: leauing behind them a much better course, both himselfe in not seeking to haue vsed it first, and his Seruantes that they did not mooue him first of all to haue sought vnto God, and to haue humbled himselfe vnto him; and then to haue vsed such ordinary meanes as God had ordained, eyther this, or any other whatsoeuer. As God had therein another meaning, it seemeth to bee, to make this a meane to bring <hi>Dauid</hi> to farther knowledge among them, and to make the king himselfe beholding vnto him. In that which he did on behalfe of the people, wee are likewise to consider of it, first as but that thing was intended by him: but then, as God had a farther mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in it. As but that thing was intended by him, according as the <hi>Philistims</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ibid. 17: 1-3.</note> praesumed to come into the Land in hostile manner: so he went downe with his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces too, to make reststance, and to stop their passage. As God had a further mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in it, it was to bring <hi>Dauid</hi> (who hauing attended <hi>Saule</hi> for a time, was nowe gone home, and there againe kept his Fathers Sheepe) both to the knowledge of the <note place="margin">Ibid. 15.</note> whole Land, and to make them all beholding vnto him: that as hee had already or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained him to such a purpose, so now would he (but as it were by degrees) bring him forth towards it, or to bee in a readinesse for it. But this Story would bee a little more specially considered, both for the matter that now we are in: and for another <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> hereunto appertaining. For the matter that now we are in, that wee may the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter see howe farre it pleased God to aduance <hi>Dauids</hi> credite thereby, it is needfull more specially to marke what was the distresse that the King and the people at that time were in: then what was the helpe, that it pleased God by <hi>Dauid</hi> to giue them. Their distresse was, not so much the Army or maine force of the <hi>Philistims</hi> at this time: as the feare that they were in, and the reproach they were put vnto, by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance and challenge of <hi>Goliah</hi> their Champion, none of them daring to vndertake him, he was in reason so great an ouer-match for any of them. For with their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my <note place="margin">Ibid. 1.</note> they made but little entrance into the Land: and, as it seemeth, had no other mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning (to speake of) but to man out that Champion of theirs, or to maintaine that his challenge against the <hi>Israelites.</hi> For he was of <hi>Gath,</hi> one of the Citties of the <hi>Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stims:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ibid. 4. Ibid. 1. <hi>Adrichom.</hi> Ibid 4-11, 24. Ibid. 33.</note> and the place where they pitched their Army, was neere vnto it. But their Champion, being a man of out-growne stature, and of strength (as by his furniture it appeareth) correspondent thereunto, &amp; envred to the wars, euen from his youth, did so offer the challenge vnto them, with so great brags, and with wordes of despight, that both the King himselfe, and the stoutest Captaines and Souldiers of all his Army besides, were afraid of him, and were so farre from vndertaking to cumbate with him, that they durst not abide the sight of him: and yet had the King (as it seemeth, by report of diuers of the Army) made offer before, of grear rewards, and his Daughter <note place="margin">Ibid. 25. 27, 30</note> in marriage, to him that should kill him; and to make that whole Family of his, free in <hi>Israell,</hi> from such tribute or impositions as were layde vpon others. In the help that it pleased God by <hi>Dauid</hi> to giue them, it shall bee good to consider of it, first generally: then, of some particulars besides. Generally, it was, that <hi>Dauid</hi> being <note place="margin">Ibid. 17-54.</note> sent to see his Bretheren, who were there in the Army vnder <hi>Saule,</hi> his Spirite so rose against the Champion of the <hi>Philistims,</hi> to heare his proude and despightfull speeches, that he could not abide them; without any Warre-like Weapon encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered with him; cleane beyonde the expectation of all, praeuailed against him: and got the whole Army a faire day against all the rest of the <hi>Philistims.</hi> The parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars were, some before the Cumbate: and some, after. Before the Cumbate, <hi>Dauid</hi> coulde no sooner talke of vndertaking it, in the hearing of his elder Brother <note place="margin">Ibid. 26-28.</note>
               <hi>Eliab,</hi> but that <hi>Eliab</hi> did rate him for it, &amp; condemned him of insolent pride therein:
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:7530:155"/> as none of vs also can at any time set in hand with any speciall seruice of God, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> any way transcendeth the course of the Worlde, but that wee are like to be in such sort censured, euen by our elder Bretheren also. When <hi>Saule</hi> saw the readinesse of <hi>Dauid,</hi> first hee discouraged him, at al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> meddle with that interprize: but then, when he saw him resolute in it, hee endeuo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ed to set him foorth, or helpe him for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward accordingly. When hee did discourage him to meddle with it in respect of the oddes that was betwixt them in ordinary account, <hi>Dauid</hi> then calling to minde <note place="margin">Ibid. 33-37.</note> that the Lord had already wrought extraordinarily by him twice, once against a Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, another time against a Beare, hee gathered thereby, that so the Lorde will assist him now also against that out-growne Champion of theirs: and so should we of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer fauours, in diuers cases raise vp our selues to conceiue good hope (in the way of our calling) of Gods ready help, though otherwise it be some difficult seruice. When he endeauored to set him foorth, or to helpe him forward accordingly, it was with his Armor; but when <hi>Dauid</hi> assayed how he could go therwith, he found it too cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bersome <note place="margin">Ibid. 37-40.</note> for him, and therefore put it off againe, and betooke himselfe to his sling: and so may wee see that it is not oft-times the power of Princes whereby the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell is most aduanced; but euen that weaker instrument of the word, God working there-with by his mighty power. After the cumbat, we find that <hi>Saule</hi> had cleane forgotten him: but <hi>Ionathan</hi> was otherwise affected towardes him. In that <hi>Saul</hi> had so cleane forgotten him, hauing beene in his seruice before, so neere about his person, and to his good liking then, it may well bee a token of the brittlenesse of the fauour of the greater sort towardes the meaner. But some heereuppon haue <note place="margin">Tremel. Iun.</note> thought, that this cumbayting with <hi>Goliah,</hi> was before his attendaunce on the King with his Instrument: not considering, as it seemeth, that after this, hee was not suffered to returne againe, but imployed in seruice against the Enemy; nor, that <note place="margin">Ibid. 18. 215.</note> it had been much absurder that <hi>Dauid</hi> should haue beene forgotten after this publike seruice in the field, than in that his private seruice to the King in his Chamber, or that after this, he euer returned to keepe his Fathers sheepe againe. The affection of <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nathan</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ibid. 16: 19. 17: 15. Ibid. 18: 1, 3, 4.</note> towards him was such, that he loued him as himselfe, became a sworne Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vnto him, and by and by put off his own best raiment and furniture, and bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the same on <hi>Dauid:</hi> God giuing him now a faithfull friende euen in the House of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
               <hi>Saule</hi> himselfe, whence ere long much affliction was to arise vnto him. That other matter heereunto appertaining, is that this Story may be (for diuers thinges in it) a Figure of Christ; namely, that as it was with the <hi>Israelites,</hi> that they had not one Man in all the Army, able to encounter <hi>Goliah,</hi> that by him they might bee all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quited, till God to that purpose did send in <hi>Dauid:</hi> euen so was it with vs also, that albeit God himselfe were willing, that if wee had any one among vs, that could aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere the Iustice of God for vs, then should we by him bee discharged, yet had wee none, neyther could wee make one among vs all, till himselfe sent in his onely begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Sonne among vs, for vs to satisfie his aeternall Iustice, and so to worke redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for vs.</p>
            <p n="4">4 The worse course that after hee tooke, and held on the same, euen to the end, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> was, that now he bent himselfe against <hi>Dauid,</hi> and did his endeuour to ouer-lay him the best that he could. Concerning which, we are first to see, what may seeme to be the occasion of it: then, in what manner it was performed. The occasion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of may seeme to be the praesent disposition of King <hi>Saul:</hi> and, some outward thinges besides. The praesent disposition of King <hi>Saul,</hi> ill enough in it selfe by the common corruption of all, was now so much the worse, by that ill Spirite sent of the Lorde, <note place="margin">Ibid. 16: 14. 18: 12.</note> that so often vexed him now. Those outward thinges besides, were, that it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed GOD, especiallie to preserue and prosper <hi>Dauid</hi> in all his wayes; and, that the people thereuppon had him in such reckoning as they had: as namely, in the vanquishing of <hi>Goliah,</hi> that as it pleased GOD to vouchsafe him that fauour; so the people thereuppon ascribed more a great deale to <hi>Dauid,</hi> than they did <note place="margin">Ibi 17: 49-51. Ibid. 18: 6-9, 16, 29, 30.</note> vnto <hi>Saule,</hi> whereat the King euen at that praesent shewed himselfe to bee much offended, and to haue an especiall Eye to him so much the more afterward also.
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:7530:156"/> The manner wherein he did performe it, was first more secret: but then, more open. At such time as it was more secret, he would first haue slaine him by his owne hands <note place="margin">Ibid. 10, 11.</note> twice: then, by the enemy, and therefore gaue him charge of a thousand men; and <hi>Michal</hi> his yonger daughter in marriage, for an hundred foreskins of the <hi>Philistims.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ibid. 12-16. Ibid. 17-30</note> When such close dealing would not serue, then he fell to doe it openly, and so eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly withal, that he chased him out of the Land thrice: in the two former of which <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> returned soone into the Land againe; but not the last of them, tel <hi>Saul</hi> was slaine. In the former therefore of the first two of them we are to consider, first of that which <hi>Saul</hi> did against him, then, how <hi>Dauid</hi> for a time went out of the Land to saue him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe. That which <hi>Saul</hi> did against him, was, that he bare himselfe very hard, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly against him: but against one other also of speciall reckoning for his sake. Hee bare himselfe so very hard against him, that first hee set on others to kill him: then, when that fayled, he would afterward himselfe haue done it. Those others that hee <note place="margin">Ibid. 19: 1-7</note> sent to kill him were his sonne, and all his seruants: but <hi>Ionathan,</hi> first admonishing <hi>Dauid</hi> of it, and willing him to take good heede to himselfe, then so dealt with his father on <hi>Dauids</hi> behalfe, that <hi>Saul</hi> was then pacified, forethought himselfe of his bad meaning towards him, by plaine oath put his sonne out of iealousie that he would not doe it, and for a certaine time after did accordingly vse himselfe towards him. He would afteward himselfe haue done it twice: once, vpon good successe that <hi>Dauid</hi> had against the enemies; an other time, by opportunity of a feast. The good suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse▪ that <hi>Dauid</hi> had against the enemies, was, that he gaue the <hi>Philistims</hi> a very <note place="margin">Ibid. S. Ibid 9. 10.</note> great ouerthrow: whereupon <hi>Saul</hi> (the euill spirit then being vpon him) was on a time secretly minded to slay <hi>Dauid,</hi> as hee was handling his Instrument before him, but that he warily auoyded the same, presently gat home, and went thense likewise vnto some place of better safety; and when hee saw that <hi>Dauid</hi> had so escaped, hee sent presently after, had good hope for a time to haue sped, but by the helpe of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ibid. 11-17.</note> his daughter <hi>Dauids</hi> wife, was againe defeated, both at <hi>Dauids</hi> house, and at <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mah</hi> to when himselfe went thither. The opportunity he conceiued he might haue <note place="margin">Ibid. 18. 24.</note> at a feast, soone after ensuing, was, when by course, <hi>Dauid</hi> was to fit with the King at the table: but <hi>Dauid</hi> foreseeing that likewise, by the meanes and helpe of <hi>Ionathan</hi> escaped that also. That one other of speciall reckoning against whom he bare him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe <note place="margin">Ibid. 20: 1-29</note> so hard for his sake, was <hi>Ionathan</hi> his son: with whom he was so far offended, on<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly for excusing <hi>Dauids</hi> absence, that presently hee did reuile him sharpely for it; and <note place="margin">Ibid. 30-33.</note> tolde him that hee should neuer haue the kingdome in quietnesse, so long as <hi>Dauid</hi> liued; but then, when <hi>Ionathan</hi> did farther plead the innocency of <hi>Dauid,</hi> he tooke it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> so impaciently that he should so doe, that he cast his speare at him, and so it seemeth, in that his perturbation, he would haue slaine him. But <hi>Dauid</hi> hauing escaped the danger so narrowly as he had, thought not good now to abiet in the Land, and so departed: in which part of his Story, there is one thing so mistaken by some, that it had neede to bee more specially considered on: and so are wee f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>st to consider of the maine Story, therein; then, of that particular that is so mistaken by others. The maine Story for this matter is no more but this, that <hi>Dauid</hi> to auoyde the handes of <hi>Saul</hi> did flee vnto <hi>Achish</hi> one of the Kings of the <hi>Philistims:</hi> yet not to himselfe as it seemeth by the Story, because the King had him first brought vnto him by his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, <note place="margin">1. Sam. 21: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>0-15. 22: 1.</note> but hoping belike by some meanes that hee had, to liue vnespyed there. But when he perceiued that certaine of them knew him, then he fained to be as a man di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracted, or out of his wits, and so escaping that danger, returned into <hi>Iurie</hi> againe. The particular that was heerein mistaken, is therefore the rather to be considered, for that certaine of the enemies of the Gospell since haue thence taken one of their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments for that late deuise of theirs of Transubstantiation. For whereas <hi>Augustine</hi> red, <note place="margin">Augustine.</note> that <hi>Dauid</hi> at this time was carryed in his owne hands towards the King, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferreth thereon, that that could not be true in <hi>Dauid</hi> himselfe: but that, whereas <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> was a figure of Christ, in him it was fulfilled at his last Supper, himselfe giuing his body and blood to his Desciples, and so then made with his owne handes deliuery of himselfe vnto them. But now the truth is, both that the Father was deceaued in the Text it selfe (as also the vulgar Translation is, that hee sunke downe or fell in their
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:7530:156"/> handes); and himselfe dooth shortly after qualifie the hardnesse of his speech that it was (not simply) but after a sort, that Christ did so diliuer himselfe vnto his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples. In the latter likewise, we are first to consider of his Story in the Land, being now returned: then, of his departure againe. His Story in the Land at this time is but small, being no more but this, that being now returned, and for his strength be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking himselfe to a Caue at <hi>Adullam,</hi> there repayred diuers vnto him, to the number <note place="margin">Ibid. 22: 1, 2.</note> of foure hundred in all: part, of his kindred and fathers house; the residue, such as were in trouble or debt, or some way or other discontented. A right patterne of the Congregation or militant Church of Christ heere: neuer being any other, but ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther such as are of his of-spring by regeneration, or that high Linage from aboue: or <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> such as are in danger of Law, or ouerwhelmed with debt, or some way or other di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stressed heere. But as now at the first <hi>Dauid</hi> had but these fewe, and those of such quality, as in good respect he myght well be ashamed of many of them, to haue any such in his retinue; yet after he came to enioy the whole Kingdom, &amp; to be attended by al the greatest &amp; most honorable personages: so haue we partly seene, and are to wayt for a farther accōplishment of it, in Christ himselfe, that though his retinue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted but of mean thinges at the first, yet since haue many of greatest reckoning sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted both themselues and theirs vnto his Scepter, and is likewise to haue al powers in heauen and earth subiect vnto him. When now he fled out of the Land againe, we haue not set downe by what occasion it was in particular: but the whole Story doth lead vs to gather, that it was for his safety; and at this time it was to the Land of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ab,</hi> whereunto he for his safety repayred. Where also we haue no more but this, that <note place="margin">Ibid. 3-<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="5">5 When after he left his Countrey agayne, and neuer returned so long as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
               <hi>Saule</hi> liued, wee are in like manner as afore to see, first what was his Story in the Lande: then, in what sort hee left it agayne. His Story in the Lande at this time was much: partly while <hi>Saul</hi> vnderstanding he was now in the Land, neuerthelesse could not yet tell where he might haue him; but most of all so oft as hee could get more speciall intelligence where hee was to bee had. When <hi>Saul</hi> did now vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand that hee was in the Land, but yet knew not where to haue him, one Story wee haue that sheweth how eagarly <hi>Saul</hi> was bent against him: another, how <hi>Dauid</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding did not keepe himselfe so close, but that he was ready ynough to come forth to the ayde of such as were distressed. That which sheweth how eagerly <hi>Saul</hi> was bent agaynst hym, is partly in wordes: but cheifly in deedes. In wordes hee made a set complaynt to all his attendants about him, that hys Sonne <hi>Ionathan</hi> had made a couenant with <hi>Dauid,</hi> and had stirred hym vp agaynst him: and that none of <note place="margin">Ibid. 6-8.</note>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> them were sorry for him, but kept their counsell, as if they looked for speciall preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at the handes of <hi>Dauid,</hi> and so in effect conspyred agaynst him. His deedes that followed, proceeded of a speciall information then made vnto him; so first of that speciall information; then of those his needes ensuing. That information was made by <hi>Doeg</hi> an <hi>Edomite,</hi> against <hi>Ahimelek</hi> the High Priest, and it was no more <note place="margin">Ibid. 9. 10.</note> but truth as it seemeth: but yet so framed as might seeme to import very treasonable meaning in him. His deedes that followed heereupon, were so very tart and bitter, that they giue vs iust occasion to looke farther into that matter, than this praesent Story deliuereth vnto vs: so that first we are to consider of it, so far as this Story doth lead vs; and then to see, what we are farther to think of this matter. Going but so far as this Story doth leade vs, we finde the occasion was but small: but his displeasure very great. The occasion was, that <hi>Dauid</hi> comming to <hi>Ahimelek</hi> in some want, hee not knowing, that now he was in the displeasure, did something supply the wants that he had. The occasion of <hi>Dauids</hi> comming vnto him now, was, that <hi>Ionathan</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording <note place="margin">Ibid. 34-43.</note> to his promise and couenant before, made true and faithfull relation to <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid,</hi> how deepely his father was offended with him, so that indeede hee meant to slay
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:7530:157"/> him: and so shewing himselfe desirous, that the couenant they had made betwixt them might euer stand he dismissed him now, and wished him to shift for himselfe so well as he could. So the want that <hi>Dauid</hi> was in, when he came to <hi>Ahimilek,</hi> was, that <note place="margin">Ibid. 21: 3, 8.</note> by the reason of this his sodaine departure, he and his smal company came without vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuals, and himselfe without weapon also. In <hi>Ahimeleks</hi> supplying these wants of <hi>Dauid,</hi> we are first to consider, what it was that so he did: and then, of another mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter implyed therein. That which so he did, was most of it about the releeuing of him in his hunger: but part of it also, in that he did furnish him with a Weapon. To releeue his hunger when <hi>Dauid</hi> desired some sustenance for him and his, the Priest hauing nothing else at that praesent, gaue them of the Shewe-Bread which was not lawfull for any to eate, but onely for the Priestes. Whereuppon, when by occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion <note place="margin">Mat. 12: 4.</note> Christ doth afterward alleage this Fact of <hi>Dauid,</hi> though most men take it (so farre as yet I haue founde) as in defence of his Disciples, by that Facte of <hi>Dauid</hi>

That other that is but implyed therein, is, that there was in those dayes but small regard vnto the Ministery, when as this <hi>Ahimelek</hi> the High-Priest, and so in chiefe place of all the Ministery, was so little prouided for, that nowe hee <note place="margin">

To furnrsh him with a Weapon, he let him haue the Sword of <hi>Goliah</hi> being laide vp there, the <note place="margin">1.

But if we marke what followed very soone after, vnto <hi>Ahimelek</hi> and all his company of Priestes there, and to the whole Cittie besides, wee may very well doubt, that it was <note place="margin">1. Sam. 22: 9-19.</note> a greater matter with God than themselues did take it, or others since haue thought it to bee, that <hi>Ahimelek</hi> was so ready to impart the Shewe-Bread to <hi>Dauid</hi> and his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> company, and now to yeelde this Sword vnto him, though in this place the Text doe not so charge them: especially, seeing that first vnder the Law such thinges were so strictly forbidden, and one of the kindes so seuerely punished in <hi>Achan;</hi> then, vnder the Gospell Christ himselfe saith, for the former of them, that it was not lawfull for them so to haue do one.

<pb n="293" facs="tcp:7530:157"/> and therefore likely enough to bee partiall on his Maisters behalfe; and the same <note place="margin">1. Sam. 21: 7. 22: 9.

Both which notwithstanding, the King tooke this so maruellous ill at the hands of <hi>Ahimelek</hi> the <note place="margin">Ibid. 16-20.</note> High-Priest, that he did not onely put him to death, but for his sake fourescore and foure Priestes moe, together with the residue (one onely excepted that made an es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape) of all their Family, Man, Woman, and Childe, with all their Cattle great and small: his rage being so great therein, that euen his owne Seruants would not be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutioners thereof, though he had giuen it in charge vnto them; sauing that <hi>Doeg</hi> the Accuser himselfe, did as barbarously performe the execution, as the King had in the depth of rigour giuen it in charge. That which wee haue farther to thinke of this matter, is partly a farther charge laid to <hi>Ahimelek</hi> than yet we read of: but most of it as touching the seueritie of this his heauy iudgement against him and the rest of his Family. That farther charge that was laid to <hi>Ahimelek,</hi> was, that hee asked coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell of the Lord for <hi>Dauid:</hi> a thing that <hi>Doeg</hi> laid to his charge, and <hi>Ahimelek</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe <note place="margin">Ibid. 10. Ibid. 15.</note> did not deny. A good token (if it were so indeed) first, on <hi>Dauids</hi> part, both that in his trouble he sought to the Lorde, and that hee had no ill heart to the King, when he was but of such intention as wherein hee sought to haue his direction from God: then, on <hi>Saules,</hi> that eyther he needed not to be offended with <hi>Dauid</hi> for this, or else that now himselfe had no good heart towards God, when he could not take it well, that his aduise should be taken therein. As touching the seuerity of this hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uy iudgement against him and the rest of his Family, it shall bee good for vs to note <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> two things therin: one, that such things were before denounced; the other, whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it was that God did take occasion so to deale. In that they were before denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, <note place="margin">1. Sam. 2: 27-36 3: 11-14.

How <hi>Dauid</hi> notwithstanding did not keep himselfe so close, but that hee was ready enough to come forth to the ayde of such as were distressed, the Storie of of <hi>Keilah</hi> is witnesse sufficient. But therein we haue not onely that Story it selfe: but another accident withall to that place belonging. In that Story it selfe, wee haue, not onelie how ready <hi>Dauid</hi> was to help them: but withall, how little help he might look for at their hands. He was so ready to help thē, that so soon as he heard they were distressed <note place="margin">1. Sam. 23:-5.</note> (which was, for that the <hi>Philistims</hi> did besiedge them, and had them, it seemeth, at the aduantage, because God himselfe doth tearm that his helping of thē to be the sauing of that Citty) he but inquired of the Lord (first for his own resolution, &amp; then again <note place="margin">Ibid. 2.</note> for the better resolution of his company, because some of them made some doubt of it) &amp; then went against them, made a great slaughter of them, &amp; brought away much Cattle with them. In that he might look for little help at their hands againe, it shall be good for vs to consider, not only how the same appeareth: but also whereupon it may seeme to be grounded. It plainely appeareth in that when <hi>Saule</hi> heard he was <note place="margin">Ibid. 7-12.</note> there, and being a glad man of it, that hee had him (as hee tooke it) inclosed vp in a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> Citty to his best aduantage, came to surprise him, and <hi>Dauid</hi> inquiring of the Lorde, whether <hi>Saul</hi> would indeede come downe against him, and if hee did, whether the Gouernors of the Citty would deliuer him into his hands. The Lord did plainely an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>,
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:7530:158"/> that <hi>Saul</hi> would come downe against him, and that the Gouernors would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer him into his hands. So the Seruants of God must be content to do good vnto others, though there be no meaning in those others againe to requite it. That they would not stand to him against their King, it may very well be without any vnthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes in them, both for that in duty they might not, and in power they were not able to stand against him: &amp; so, if they had made that attempt, they could not but haue wrapped themselues and <hi>Dauid</hi> withall into ineuitable destruction, and the same ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry iustly deserued. A place so much the meeter to bee noted, for that it is the manner of most men, when they haue made others beholding vnto them, then to looke that for it they should stand with them, farther than in duty they ought, or on behalfe of them and theirs it were meete that they should: or otherwise to thinke very hardly of them, and to account them very vnthankfull; as there be that thought <note place="margin">

At this time <hi>Saule</hi> began to vnderstand where <hi>Dauid</hi> was to bee had, and so did hee diuers times after: but wherea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

First, therefore at this time hearing that hee was now <note place="margin">Ibid. 7, 8.</note> at <hi>Keilah,</hi> hee gathered his forces together, and hastned thither-ward, vppon great hope to surprize him there: but <hi>Dauid</hi> inquiring of the Lord, vnderstood what dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger <note place="margin">Ibid. 9-13.</note> was towardes him, and so by flight in time escaped (his company being then en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased two hundred mo, and so now six hundred in all) of whose flight from thence when <hi>Saul</hi> was aduertised, he also then gaue ouer that iourney. Where <hi>Dauid</hi> was after, and how busily <hi>Saul</hi> imployed himselfe to get him; we haue first set downe ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally: and more specially after. Generally, it is saide that <hi>Dauid</hi> thence-for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward shifted for himselfe and his company, now in one place, now in another, so wel <note place="margin">Ibid. 13, 14.</note> as he could; and that <hi>Saul</hi> did seeke him euery day: but that God did not deliuer <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> him into his handes. More specially wee finde, that <hi>Dauid</hi> was three seuerall times discouered to <hi>Saul,</hi> in those by-places of woodes and Wasts wherein he walked and hid himselfe; and that <hi>Saul,</hi> euer as he got intelligence of him, tooke the aduantage of it so well as he could, and endeauoured to get him: yet that successe or issue of his desires was no better than this, for the first time hee did but faile of his purpose, but did not bring himselfe in daunger withall; the other two he brought his owne per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son into speciall danger thereby. In the first of those when himselfe as yet came in no danger, <hi>Dauid</hi> first had one speciall comfort: and then was exercised with harde and bad dealing. The speciall comfort that first he had, was that <hi>Ionathan Saules</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ibid 16-18.</note> eldest Son did yet abide so fast vnto <hi>Dauid,</hi> notwithstanding his father was so grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous vnto him, that he came secretly where <hi>Dauid</hi> was, bad him bee of good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and renewed the couenant with him. The hard and bad dealing wherewith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all he was exercised immediately after, was first the vnkindnesse of the <hi>Ziphims,</hi> who who also were of the Tribe of <hi>Iudah,</hi> and so of one and the selfe-same Tribe with <note place="margin">Ibid. 19, 20, 24.</note>
               <hi>Dauid,</hi> and yet notwithstanding not onely tolde him where he was, but offered also to deliuer him into his hands (a reasonable good patterne how vntrusty the best that are may sometimes finde their owne Kindred to be:) then, that hot pursute of <hi>Saule</hi> thereupon against him, hauing but the edge of an hill betwixt them, and so eagerly following vpon him, that in the meane season he suffered the <hi>Philistims</hi> to breake in <note place="margin">Ibid. 21-23. 25-28.</note> vpon them, by whom notwithstanding he was soone after withdrawne (full sore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like against his will) when hee had almost compassed <hi>Dauid</hi> and his men cleane a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, &amp; so shut them vp in the iawes of death. In those other two, wherin he brought his owne person in danger, we haue some other story enterlaced, appertaining as it seemeth vnto the meane time betwixt them; &amp; yet are so noted by the circumstance of the time, that they seeme rather to hang as appendants vnto the former, than to haue any relation at all to the latter: and so are wee first to consider, of the former of these; then, of those Storyes that ensue there-vppon. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer <note place="margin">Ibid. 24: 1. <hi>Chr: Adricho.</hi>
               </note> of these, was at <hi>Engeddie,</hi> in the East side of <hi>Iudah,</hi> neere vnto the Dead sea, at which time when <hi>Saule</hi> perceiued how daungerously hee had falne <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> into the hands of <hi>Dauid,</hi> and that <hi>Dauid</hi> neuerthelesse had spared him, he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
<pb facs="tcp:7530:158"/> so touched with it, that he condemned himself therein, and sought to haue a league of <hi>Dauid.</hi> So are we first to consider of that his pursuite in hostile man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: <note place="margin">Ibid. 2, 3.</note> then, of that his relenting after. His pursuite in hostile manner we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 word">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> he relented thereon. To find in what sort <hi>Dauid</hi> dealt with him, we are likewise first to see, how he fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Dauids</hi> curtesie: and then, when <hi>Dauid</hi> had him within his danger, how he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaned himselfe towards him. <hi>Dauid</hi> and his men to escape the eye of <hi>Saul,</hi> had entered into a great Caue, and were in the inmost parts of it: at which time <hi>Saule</hi> comming that way, and turned into the mouth of that Caue to doo his easement: <note place="margin">Ibid. 4.</note> and so fell into the hands of <hi>Dauid,</hi> hee and his men espying him there. In the demeanor of <hi>Dauid</hi> towards him, wee are first to consider what it was: then how he acquainted <hi>Saule</hi> himselfe with it. His demeanor towards him was at the first indeede somewhat doubtfull: but afterward very good. When it was but doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, because it was by the solicitation or aduise of others, therefore are wee first to see what aduise it was that others did giue him: then, how farre-forth <hi>Dauid</hi> did <note place="margin">Ibid. 5.</note> put it in practise. The aduice that others did him, was in effect, that the Lorde had now brought him within his daunger: and therefore that hee was to take the aduantage of it. So diuers account, that the Lord oft-times doth bring thinges to their hands for them to take the opportunity of them, when as indeede it is but onely for their tryall. How farre <hi>Dauid</hi> did put it in practise, wee cannot certainly <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> tell, because we know not with what minde hee went vnto him. But sure it is, that thereupon he drew towards him, though in the end he did no more but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cut off the lap of his garment that belike he had laide by, and quickely repented <note place="margin">Ibid. 6.</note> him of that also: as indeede it was not to bee iustified, whensoeuer it should bee rightly examined. And so the children of God carry that reuerence and true alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> to their Superiors, that though by infirmity sometime they slip: yet other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise do they make more conscience at a lap of their garment, than manie of those that God hath placed in great authority, euen at the heart-bloud of those their <note place="margin">Ibid. 7, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

That part of it which was very good, was, that when he returned to his men againe, both he was himselfe very resolute, that in no wise he might lay his hands on the Lords annoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: <note place="margin">Ibid. 9-14.</note> and disswaded them also for attempting any such matter against him. To acquaint <hi>Saule</hi> with it also, he went forth of the Caue immediately after <hi>Saul,</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led vpon him, did his obeysance, and then opened his minde vnto him: the effect of which was, that now he might haue good testimony, that he was not so ill min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded towards him as others bare him in hand that hee was, when as hauing him in <note place="margin">Ibid. 15, 16</note> the Caue he laid no hands in him, but onely cut off the lap of his garment, to be a witnesse, what he might haue done to him then, if he had beene so disposed; and withall, to shew him the vnseemelinesse of that his pursute, that the King of <hi>Israel</hi> in that great power of his, should bend himselfe against him in that weakenes that then he was in. In that relenting of <hi>Saule</hi> after his minde was so changed now (a good experiment, what dutifull and gentle dealing may do, euen with those, that <note place="margin">Ibid. 17-23.</note> most of all others are out of temper) that yeelding himselfe faulty, hee iustified <hi>Dauid,</hi> and sought to haue a league of him (which also he had) as making no doubt by this good dealing, but that he should come to the kingdome indeede: al which notwithstanding, when <hi>Saule</hi> departed, <hi>Dauid</hi> yet still stood on his guard. The Stories ensuing are of two sorts; one, concerning all the whole people generally; the others, concerning <hi>Dauid</hi> more specially. That which concerneth all the <note place="margin">Ibi. 25. 1. 28: 3</note> whole people generally, is, that now it pleased God to take away from them by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall death the Prophet <hi>Samuell:</hi> for whom all <hi>Israell</hi> assembled together and mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,

He brought himselfe in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> danger by giuing so churlish an answere vnto <hi>Dauids</hi> Messengers as hee did: and so are we first to see, in what sort <hi>Dauid</hi> sent vnto him; then, what was the answere he gaue them. <hi>Dauid</hi> beeing in those parts not farre off from him, and vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <note place="margin">Idid. 2-6, 8.</note> that then he had a Sheepe-shearing, and conceiuing thereon, that as hee was a great wealthy man, so he would haue good store of prouision against that time (as it seemeth the manner was) sent vnto him in very good and curteous manner, to spare <note place="margin">Ibid. 7, 11. 2, Sam. 13: 23.</note> vnto him and his company some part of his prouision, such as himselfe should thinke good to bestow vpon them: putting him in minde withall, how little he was endam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maged <note place="margin">Ibid. 7, 8.</note> by any of his company, when they lay where his goods were; as hoping, that their good dealing with him then, would be so much better requited now. In the answer that was giuen, wee are to consider, what the aunswere it selfe was: and, in what sort <hi>Dauid</hi> did take it. The answere it selfe that <hi>Nabal</hi> gaue, was very bad: both contemptuous to the person of <hi>Dauid;</hi> and vtterly denying him to haue any <note place="margin">Ibid. 9-11.</note> thing thence. <hi>Dauid</hi> also tooke it so very ill, that praesently hee armed foure hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred of his men, and was fully purposed, that night vtterly to destroy both him &amp; his: <note place="margin">Ibid. 12, 13, 21, 22.</note> a speciall example, both that a churlish vnthankfulnesse woundeth sore; and that <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> was a man much subiect vnto his infirmity, who would haue beene so grieuously auenged on so priuate an iniury as that. In that <hi>Nabal</hi> escaped the perrill of it, it was but with men, as it seemeth: and not so with God. A thing to bee noted of vs also, that we may oft-times escape the handes of men: and yet may not therefore hope to be freede from the iudgements of God. With men he escaped it, in that praesently after there was such course taken, as whereby <hi>Dauid</hi> was pacified: and so are we to see what course it was that now was taken; then, how <hi>Dauid</hi> was pacified with it. The course that nowe was taken to that purpose, was by <hi>Abigail, Nabals</hi> Wife, vppon the intelligence that shee had by one of her Seruants. For one of the Seruants tolde her, not onely howe vncurtuously <hi>Nabal</hi> his Maister had vsed <hi>Dauids</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ibid. 14-17.</note> Messengers; &amp; how good cause there was to haue them vsed otherwise: but also ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uised her to bethink herselfe how to help it, as making no quaestion, but that other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise it would bee auenged; and their Mayster was so vntractable, that there was no dealing with him. Heereupon <hi>Abigail,</hi> beeing a rare Woman, both for other or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments <note place="margin">Ibid. 3.</note> of Nature, and for wisedome too, made hast to make vp that default of her <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="L"/> Husbands the best that she could: both by sending a liberall praesent before her, and <note place="margin">Ibid. 18-20. Ibid. 23-31.</note> then, following herselfe immediatly after, by her own demeanour towards <hi>Dauid,</hi> &amp; by the wise course of her speech, that she had with him. Wherein one thing especially is worthy the marking, how wisely she cōmendeth vnto him, the keeping of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science cleane frō sin now, against the time that afterward he should sit on the Thron <note place="margin">Ibid. 30, 31.</note> of his Kingdome. In which likewise she vseth one speciall phrase not to be omitted: namely, that it wil be no grief to him afterward to remember, that he did not preserue <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> himself, or as <hi>Dauid</hi> by &amp; by after vseth the like, that his own hand did not saue him: a phrase, or a kind of speech that affordeth much good matter, to al those, that so litle <note place="margin">Ibid. 33.</note> rest on the prouidence of God, that in all such matters they euer chuse rather to be theyr owne Caruers. <hi>Dauid</hi> also was so pacified therewith, that he praysed God, &amp; <note place="margin">Ibid. 32-35.</note> thanked hir that had mollified his minde in that matter: and now altogether remitted vnto her, the rigour of that his intended purpose. That hee did not escape it with God, may partly appeare the next morning: but especially a few dayes after. The next morning it did partly appeare, for that he was strucken with so great a feare so <note place="margin">Ibid. 36, 37.</note> soone as he vnderstood by his Wife, in what danger he was the night before, both he and all his to haue beene slaughtered: though yet at that praesent hee were passing
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:7530:159"/> merry. The feare of which danger the lesse that now hee was able to beare, the more may it bee a good document to vs, that whereas there is an hard heart voide of compassion towards those that neede, or but so vnthankfull towards those that haue deserued well, there is no little sound comfort towards God, that it is lesse maruell if such things do strike them with so speciall a feare. Those few daies after were but ten, at which time the Lord so stroke him, that then he died: a smaller time to enioy <note place="margin">Ibid. 38.</note> those things, whereof he was so loath to part with any portion to <hi>Dauid,</hi> than he was aware of; but yet a meete pattern of that skantling of time that God in his iustice now and then apportioneth to those that are so vnseasonably so very straight laced. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="M"/> his wedlocke, whereas heere in this place we haue mention of diuers Wiues of his at once, we are first to consider of them all generally: then of the Story of eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one more specially. Of them all generally no more but this, that <hi>Dauid</hi> was not <note place="margin">Ibid. 42-44.</note> so well aduised of the institution or ordinance of Wedlocke, neither yet of his duty therein, but that fowly he steined himselfe with that one point of corruption of those daies: so dangerous is any kind of corruption (whereunto we incline by course of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) when once it hath taken roote in many. More specially the Story goeth, first of such as he enioyed: then, of one that was taken from him. Those that he enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, were two: this <hi>Abigaell</hi> that now wee speake of; and <hi>Ahinoam.</hi> As touching <note place="margin">Ibid. 39. 40</note>
               <hi>Abigaill,</hi> we haue something to note on <hi>Dauids</hi> part: and something on hers. On <hi>Dauids</hi> part, that hauing seene her person before, and hauing had experience of her wisedome then, hee reioyceth now that his hand was not against her husband, and withall doth take her to be his wife: on her part, that though she were very wise, and did much abase her selfe vnto him, yet she yeelded to bee a wife vnto him, whom be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like <note place="margin">Ibid. 41, 42.</note> she knew to haue another before. Of <hi>Ahinoam</hi> we haue no more in effect, but that <hi>Abigail</hi> and shee together were Wiues vnto <hi>Dauid.</hi> She that was taken from <note place="margin">Ibid. 43.</note> him was <hi>Micol</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Saul,</hi> whom <hi>Saul,</hi> in this his displeasure against <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ibid. 44.</note> tooke away from him, and bestowed on another, one <hi>Phalty.</hi> In which case, though <hi>Saul</hi> be not of that reckoning with vs (especially after the good Spirit of God was taken from him, and an ill spirit sent to vex him) that any will thinke his exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple warrantable: yet it may be that some may conceiue so of <hi>Dauids,</hi> that as when his Wife was giuen to another, he tooke a supplie, so might they thinke it lawfull for them to do; which notwithstanding they can neuer find to be of any vndoubted war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant vnto them. The latter of them was in the Wildernesse of <hi>Ziph,</hi> where againe he was so ouertaken, that againe hee iustifieth <hi>Dauid,</hi> and condemneth himselfe to haue done maruelous ill: protesting withall, that thenceforward he would neuer doe so againe. So that in this also we are to see, first how hee pursued vpon him in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stile manner: then how he came to a better mind after. That now he pursued him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="N"/> in hostile manner, we haue first set downe, who set him on: then, in what sort he did it. Those that set him on were the <hi>Ziphims</hi> his old friendes, of the same Tribe as I said, but false vnto him, once before, and now againe: these came vnto <hi>Saul,</hi> and <note place="margin">1. Sam. 26: 1.</note> let him vnderstand were <hi>Dauid</hi> was. Whereupon <hi>Saul,</hi> notwithstanding that hee <note place="margin">Ibid. 2, 3.</note> seemed to haue reconciled himselfe to <hi>Dauid</hi> before: yet now hoping to haue the aduantage against him, hee maketh towardes him apace with his three thousand choyce men, to see if yet he may surprise him. Hee came to a better mind notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing <note place="margin">Ibid. 4-16, 17, 18-20, 22-24.</note> when he saw that againe he was at vnwares fallen into the hands of <hi>Dauid:</hi> and that he neuerthelesse againe had spared him. He fell into his handes againe in his owne Camp, himselfe and his company being so fast a sleepe, that <hi>Dauid,</hi> and one other with him came in among them, euen to the place where the King himselfe lay: and though they might easily haue slaine him, and the other would haue done it, yet <hi>Dauid</hi> would in no wise suffer it, but onely tooke such tokens with them as might suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently witnesse they had beene there, and then, both reproued his chiefe Captaine for keeping his watch so ill as he did, and acquainted the King himselfe with the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger hee had beene in, himselfe crauing no better at the hands of God, than heerein <hi>Saul</hi> had found at his. <hi>Saul</hi> therefore perceiuing this to be so indeede, againe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged <note place="margin">Ibid. 17, 21 25.</note> his owne bad dealing against him, and that <hi>Dauid</hi> should vndoubtedly prosper, and so departed.</p>

The occasion of his departing now, was his owne doubtfulnesse, that some time or other he should fall into the hands of <hi>Saul;</hi> and therefore that it was best for him to depart: as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede <note place="margin">1.

So he departeth, he &amp; his 600. men with him: and they went vnto <hi>Achis</hi> k. of <hi>Gath,</hi> one of the Princes of the <hi>Philistims.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ibid. 2. 3.</note> As touching his Story vntill the time hee returned againe, because his returne was <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> not, till (after the death of <hi>Saul)</hi> he did returne vnto the kingdome, at which time the maine Story must go on him as King, whereas yet it goeth onely on <hi>Saule,</hi> and so must do vntill his death; we are now to consider, but of so much of the Storie of <hi>Dauid,</hi> as commeth within the life of <hi>Saule,</hi> being all that time among the <hi>Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stims,</hi> and vnder <hi>Achis</hi> aforesaid, first, for a while, he and his company being in the selfe-same Citty where the King himselfe resided; but shortly after, in another which the King bestowed vpon him. While he was in the Citty where the King himselfe resided, we haue little other story of him, but only in what sort they were there: and how he obtained another place for him and his company, so to auoid the immoderate pestering of the Citty where the King himselfe remained. They were there, euery man himselfe and his family; and so, <hi>Dauid</hi> himselfe, he and his <note place="margin">Ibid. 3.</note> two wiues with him. In the obtaining of that other place for him and his, first we haue his motion for that matter: then, how the same was graunted vnto him. His motion was, that so he and his might be lesse troublesome to the King in that prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall <note place="margin">Ibid. 5.</note> Citty of his: but by that which followeth it is not vnlikely, but that it was some part of his meaning to haue some farther liberty also, than so neere to the King, he might safely vse.

The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort that then hee gaue him besides, was first but in hope onely, by the assurance that then was giuen him: but shortly after, in the fruition of the thing it selfe. The comfort that was giuen him in hope, was, that by the Lord hee was allowed to <note place="margin">Ibid. 8.</note> follow on them, that had doone him this displeasure: and was assured withall, that he should ouer-take them, and recouer all againe. In that that <hi>Dauid</hi> was to come to the fruition of the thing it selfe, there be other things concurring withall: so that first wee are to consider of the thing it selfe, or that which respecteth the substance of it; and then to come to those other thinges that concurre there-with. The thing it selfe, or that which respecteth the substance of it, is, that whereas the <hi>Ammalekites,</hi> in that absence of <hi>Dauid,</hi> had inuaded and burnt the Citty, and had taken away all with them: he soone recouered all againe, so that nothing at all was wanting to any <note place="margin">Ibid. 9-20.</note> of them. Of those other things that concurre there-with, one of them is of the selfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>same time with the main businesse it selfe: but the others varry. That which is of the selfe-same time with the maine busines it selfe, is, that whereas the <hi>Ammalekites</hi> had spoyled many other places besides <hi>Ziklag,</hi> and had gotten a great booty together, <hi>Dauid</hi> now did not only recouer all his owne and his mens, but withall, whatsoeuer <note place="margin">Ibid. 16-20.</note> they had gotten from all other places besides, and brought it away with them (toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with their owne) vnder the name of <hi>Dauids</hi> prey. Of those that varry, one goeth before: others follow. That which goeth before, is, that although <hi>Dauid</hi> had a fayre promise of God for the matter, yet was he so far from neglecting the ordinary meanes that might lead or help thereunto, that finding by the way a young man that was but <note place="margin">Ibid. 11-16.</note> seruant to one of the <hi>Amalekites,</hi> whom his Maister left sick behind, now almost aff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Howbeit con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering what hauock he had made, on so small occasion, of the Lords Priests before; hee was but iustly required, that the Lord would not aunswere him now: and it may be a faire Lesson to many of vs (all Christendome ouer) that if wee so proceede to destroy the Ministery, as of long wee haue done, by with-drawing their needefull maintenance from them, wee also may haue the selfesame iudgement laid vppon vs. His pittifull ende, for the most part, wee haue described heere: but part of it in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place ensuing. So farre as it is described heere, the Issue of this conflict did not onely fall on the persons of those that had the woorse: but on many of theyr Cittyes besides. As touching that which befell theyr persons, whereas when these battels ioyned, hee and his were slaine in the fielde, seeing the Enemies were not content with his death, but wreaked theyr anger further on some of their dead bodyes besides, wee also are not onely to consider of his fall in the Fielde: but of that which befell him afterward also. In that his fall in the fielde, some-thing we finde common to himselfe and others: and some-thing proper to himselfe alone. Common to himselfe and others it was, that the <hi>Israelites</hi> had the worse, <hi>Saule,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ibid. 31▪ 1-3.</note> his three Sonnes, and all his Familie (to speake off) and many of the people were slaine: and, as it seemeth by the order of the Text (speaking of the flight of all, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that it speaketh of the fall of any) and by the circumstance of the place (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause their fall was in Mount <hi>Gilboa,</hi> from which they were before descended) they were all slaine, not in the face of the Enemye, but first turned to flight. Propper vnto <hi>Saule</hi> it was, that beeing wounded, hee would haue had his Armour-Bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer <note place="margin">Ibid. 4-6.</note> to haue slaine him out-right, which when hee refused, hee did endeauour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to doe it, and when that fayled likewise then (as the party himselfe confessed) <note place="margin">2. Sa. 1▪ 6-10.</note>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> hee desired another (who by occasion came by) to dispatch him out-right, so to rid him out of his paine: and that his Armour-Bearer, seeing his Lord and Mayster so to dye, made away himselfe likewise, so to dye with him. In that which after befell him, when the Enemy had wreaked his mallice vppon him, it pleased GOD so to touch the hearts of some, that they had some speciall regard vnto him. The <note place="margin">Ibid. 8-10.</note> Enemy to wreake his mallice vppon him (when the next day, going to spoyle those that were slaine, they found the bodyes of <hi>Saule</hi> and his Sonnes among the rest) both stript of his Armour, and cut off his head, and sent them home in token of <note place="margin">1.

As tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching their Story, the diuision that wee speake off, was first in the dayes of him that next succeeded; though soone after made vp againe: but then, not long after that, many of them eft-soones doing it; and neuer after returning againe.

Howe it was that certaine of them diuided themselues, wee are to know, that it was but for a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> time; and that then they grew together one people again: and so we are first to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider of that time; then, of their vniting againe. Considering but of that time, it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth that <hi>Dauid</hi> perceiued such a thing towards, and that he did seeke to praeuent it: but yet that his endeuor sorted to no effect therein. It seemeth that he did see such a thing towards, &amp; that he did seeke to praeuent it, in that by occasion hearing how the Inhabitants of <hi>Iabesh-Gilead</hi> had so well remembred their duty to <hi>Saul,</hi> he sent vnto them to thank them for it, and to let them vnderstand it should bee remembred: and <note place="margin">Ibid. 21 4-7.</note> by that occasion, he giueth them to vnderstand withall, that the house of <hi>Iudah</hi> had made him K. ouer them, and thence seemeth to raise som comfort vnto them, though their former Master, the late King, was now gone. Whether he had any such meaning therein or not, we cannot tell; knowing notwithstanding that in such case our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon infirmity is ready enough to yeelde such fruits: but whether he did meane it or not, sure we are, it did him no good; &amp; God doth often with-hold such earthly helps from those that are his, to teach them, euer, and in all thinges, to depend vpon him. The better to see, how that his endeuour (if so it were) sorted it selfe to no effect, wee need but to mark the diuision it selfe: concerning which we haue something said on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of that part of the people, who diuided themselues from the rest: and somewhat a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine that concerneth them both. Of that part of the people that diuided it selfe from the rest, it is saide, that <hi>Abner,</hi> the Generall or chiefe Captaine of <hi>Saule</hi> did set vp <note place="margin">Ibid. 12-16.</note>
               <hi>Ishboseth</hi> one of <hi>Saules</hi> Sonne, to be King ouer all the rest of the people: and that he raigned ouer those, seauen yeares and sixe months. Which fact of his now (which it may be, was no more, but to keep his owne place still, which hee was not so like to doe vnder another) may well be a great part of the occasion of that long and perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall diuision that afterward followed, in that he thus opened this gap first: and then God knoweth, for what dissention, disorder, wrath, and bloud (which afterward by that occasion fell out among them) he may be made answerable for it, in the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God. That which concerneth them both, is first but one particular: then, a relation of them both generally. The particular is, that <hi>Abner</hi> comming with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of <hi>Ishboseth</hi> to the poole of <hi>Gibeon,</hi> &amp; there meeting certain of the forces of <hi>Dauid</hi> also vnder the hand of <hi>Ioab,</hi> glorying belike in his greater forces, vrged <hi>Ioab</hi> to let some of his company to come and buckle with some of his, &amp; to make proofe of their valour, and so to make some pastime to sit downe and behold the combate.

Attempted it was (besides that of <hi>Dauids</hi> before in his message to them of <hi>Iabesh-Gilead,</hi> wherein it seemeth, as before is noted, that he was not without some such meaning) both by <hi>Abner,</hi> and <hi>Dauid</hi> together: but <hi>Abner</hi> making that offer vnto him; and <hi>Dauid</hi> going no farther therein, but onely yeelding his acceptance of it, or at least giuing no nay or refusall vnto it. In the offer that <hi>Abner</hi> made vnto <hi>Dauid</hi> for that matter, because the occasion whereon he did it is also noted, we are first to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="3 letters">

How he wrought vpon this occasion we may better per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, if first we marke how he resolued at that present then how hee did performe it after. He tooke that his reproofe so<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>l that presently he resolued, told <hi>Ishbosheth</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ibid. 8-10.</note> to his face, and bound it with a greeuous Oath, that as God had appointed <hi>Dauid</hi> to raigne (which hitherto notwithstanding he had neglected, but now can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to make it a ground-worke for the execution of his owne griefe and rancour against his Lord:) so would he now go about to performe, and not rest vntill hee had done it indeed. To performe it after, first he sent to <hi>Dauid</hi> about it: and then went himselfe also. When he sent about it, we are not onely to consider what his message was: but also, in what sort it was entertained of <hi>Dauid.</hi> His message was, <note place="margin">Ibid. 13.</note> that <hi>Dauid</hi> of right was to haue the whole kingdome: and that he, if <hi>Dauid</hi> would enter into couenant with him (belike to forgiue him that which was past, &amp; thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forward to esteeme of him as he should now shew himselfe towardes him) would now doe his faithfull endeuour to turne the whole people vnto him, and had no doubt but soone to performe it. As this message was entertained of <hi>Dauid,</hi> he did not onely respect the offer that now was made to him, but another matter besides. As touching the offer that now was made vnto him, he promiseth to do as <hi>Abner</hi> had mooued. The other matter besides, is a matter of speciall note, as it may bee <note place="margin">Ibid. 13.</note> to diuers applyed: and so are we to see, first what the matter it selfe is; then, howe it may be applyed to others. In the matter it selfe we likewise haue deliuered vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:7530:163"/> vs, first what it was that <hi>Dauid</hi> required: then, howe it was yeelded vnto him. That which hee desired was to haue his Wife <hi>Michal</hi> againe: to which <note place="margin">Ibid. Ibid. 14.</note> ende both hee gaue a speciall charge to <hi>Abner,</hi> not to come to him without her; and sent Messengers to <hi>Ishbosheth</hi> besides to send her vnto him. His de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund was so readily yeelded unto him, that <hi>Ishbosbeth</hi> sent and tooke her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way <note place="margin">Ibid. 15.</note> from the party to whom <hi>Saul</hi> had giuen her, in despight of <hi>Dauid</hi> to whom hee had giuen her before: and when <hi>Abner</hi> came vnto <hi>Dauid,</hi> he brought her with him. <note place="margin">Ibid. 16.</note>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> Wherein whatsoeuer it was that <hi>Dauid</hi> respected, whether by taking againe the Daughter of <hi>Saul</hi> to be more gracious to all that party, or that being before married vnto her he would not now breake Wedlocke with her or both together: that <hi>Ishbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth</hi> did so readily yeeld vnto it, though it may bee hee thought it no wisedome to keepe her, least <hi>Dauid</hi> should make it an occasion against him; yet may it likewise be, that he had that regard to equity, that albeit <hi>Dauid</hi> was his enemy, he would not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding affoord him his right. That which others may doe well to apply to themselues, is, partly out of <hi>Ishbosheth:</hi> but most out of <hi>Dauid.</hi> Of <hi>Ishbosheth</hi> they may doe well to learne, to haue none so mortall an enemy vnto them, no not in the case of a Kingdome, but that euer they affoord them that which is right. Of <hi>Dauid</hi> a couple: one, as she was the Daughter of <hi>Saul;</hi> the other as she was married to him before. As she was <hi>Sauls</hi> Daughter, it was likely to make the party of <hi>Saul</hi> more to affect him: and then, though God had made him great promises, yet in him may wee see, that it is not good to neglect such good and lawfull meanes, if God doe at any time giue them vnto vs. As shee was his wife before, though another had had her since, yet <hi>Dauid</hi> gaue not such place to his iealousie, that therefore hee would now break of wedlocke with her: much lesse was of mind, that now he might haue no fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship with her, but that therein he should sinne, because she was by another pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. A needfull lesson too, both for such as are more irefull and reuenging in such case among vs: and for such as are so nicely conceited. When hee went himselfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it, wee haue declared what course hee tooke: and to what effect it came in the end. The course that he tooke, was, that first he dealt with the <hi>Israelites</hi> at home: and then went to <hi>Dauid</hi> himselfe. As touching the <hi>Israelites</hi> hee did not onely <note place="margin">Ibid. 17-19.</note> deale with them all generaly, but with the Tribe of <hi>Beniamin</hi> more specially, because they by <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Ishbosheth</hi> were yet possessed of the Crowne, and so did most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne them: and his dealing with them all was, to induce them to make <hi>Dauid</hi> their King, wherein it seemeth he much praeuailed. Comming then to <hi>Dauid,</hi> hee found <note place="margin">Ibid. 20.</note> him likewise so ready in that case to receing him to fauour, and to giue him and his such entertainment, as that the matter (it seemeth) was to both their likings quickly agreed vpon: insomuch that <hi>Abner</hi> soone returned againe to goe and effect it, as <note place="margin">Ibid. 21.</note>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> they had agreed. The effect whereunto it came in the end was such, that it may make their agreement and purpose suspected; and yet notwithstanding there might bee o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cause of it too: but whatsoeuer was the cause of it, it was grieuous to <hi>Dauid</hi> that so it failed. So are we first to consider of that failing of it: then, of <hi>Dauids</hi> sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row thereon. In that failing of it likewise, it shall be good to see how farre it failed: and, what may seeme to be the occasion of it. It fayled so farre, that it was altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther broken or defeated cleane: <hi>Abner</hi> neuer reaching home to contriue it, whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer in particular it was. For being peaceably dismissed by <hi>Dauid,</hi> and with speciall <note place="margin">Ibi. 22-27, 30.</note> fauour, it seemeth <hi>Ioab,</hi> new come home and hearing of it, told the King he had done very ill to send him away, sent for him againe, and (by the helpe of <hi>Abishay</hi> his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) treacherously slew him. The occasion of it, so farre as is set downe vnto vs, was for that <hi>Abner</hi> had before slayne <hi>Hasael</hi> another of his bretheren: but that was in the field in open hostility. And so it may bee, that <hi>Abner</hi> had some meaning now to deliuet the Kingdome to <hi>Dauid</hi> by some ill dealing with <hi>Ishbosheth</hi> his Maister (nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was there any likelihood, that he could otherwise doe it) such as whereby God did not like to bring <hi>Dauid</hi> vnto the Kingdome, and therefore would not prosper them in it. The sorrowe of <hi>Dauid</hi> was such, that himselfe mourned for him, and <note place="margin">Ibid. 28-39.</note> made his seruants do so likewise, as for a Prince of speciall worth vnto him: and gaue so good testimony, that he did it vnfeinedly indeed, that all the people were resolued,

In that they dealt so Treacherously with him, though on their parts it were exceeding great Villanie so to deale: yet on his part it was but the iust iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, to be so treacherously oppressed by those, whom before he did so iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously oppose against so great and sacred a right; being (as they were) not onely his people by vsurpation, but also two of his Captaines by his own speciall appointment. <note place="margin">Ibid. 2.</note> The reward they had for it, was nothing neere to their expectation; but yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing such as was more due vnto them: iustly executed by death of him, for whose <note place="margin">Ibid. 9-12</note> sake so treacherously they slew their owne Lord and Maister. The circumstances are two: one, of the time; another, of the person. That which is of the time, is of the Raigne of him that now for the time had beene in place, who is saide to haue raig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned but two yeares, and yet that <hi>Dauid</hi> was kept from that part of the Kingdome seauen yeares and six months. Whereof, although there be diuers other opinions, yet it seemeth most likely, that <hi>Ishbosheth</hi> was not at the first set vppe to raigne, but some reasonable time after; and that the rest of the people came not in immediatly after the slaughter of <hi>Ishbosheth</hi> neither. That <hi>Ishbosheth</hi> was set vp soone after that <hi>Dauid</hi> began to solicite (as it seemed) the Inhabitants of <hi>Iabesh-Gilead</hi> (as before we heard) to draw them vnto him, seemeth to bee very agreeable vnto the Text: but then it seemeth withall, that it was some good time after, that <hi>Dauid</hi> came to <hi>Hebron</hi> first, and there by them was annointed King; as if <hi>Dauid</hi> expected them some good time (or at least had no dealing with them) but afterward by that occasion sent vnto them. So likewise it may probably bee, that the residue of the people came not in to <hi>Dauid</hi> immediatly after that <hi>Ishbosheth</hi> was taken away, but that then or shortly after, some of them began to be dropping vnto him, and so increased, till at length they came al, yet not but in some good processe of time. Both which coniectures seeme to be groū<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in this, that <hi>Ishbosheth</hi> reigned but two yeares, and yet that <hi>Dauid</hi> was not made King ouer them all, vntill that he after the death of <hi>Saul</hi> had raigned in <hi>Hebron</hi> sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen yeares and better.

In that more plentifull experience thereof which after they had, by course of the Story we find, that for a time he imployed himselfe as the praesent occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion required, and himselfe thought good: but afterwards as his function or calling was, and God appointed. He imployed himselfe as the praesent occasion required and himselfe thought good, first against the enemy: then, about Religion. The e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy at that time was the <hi>Philistims:</hi> who twice came in against <hi>Dauid;</hi> and were by him twice ouerthrowne. But the effect of this ouerthrow did not rest or die onely with them: but did reach to others also. So that first we are to confider of it, as it did but rest with them: and then as it did reach vnto others. As it did but rest with them, yet as they made two inuasions, and so were twice ouerthrowne: so are wee, seuerally to consider of either of them. In the former of them, wee haue not onely that Story it selfe: but also another besides, that seemeth to belong thereunto. The Story it self is, first of the <hi>Philistims</hi> comming in: then, of their ouerthrow there. That <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> which is of their comming in, is first of the ocasion of it: then how they tooke the occasion offered. The occasion of it was, for that they heard that <hi>Dauid</hi> was now annoynted King of all <hi>Israell:</hi> not much regarding them all belike, so long as they <note place="margin">2. Sam. 5: 17. 1. Chro. 14: 8.</note> stoode diuided; nor <hi>Dauids</hi> valour neither, so long as hee was but a petit King, ouer the Tribe of <hi>Iudah</hi> onely. But now that the whole people of <hi>Israell</hi> grew together in one, and that vnder the gouernment of <hi>Dauid,</hi> they might well conceiue, that they had neeede to see vnto it, if they could finde that they were able, yet to crop them at their pleasure. And so the enemies of the Gospell, though they seeme for a time not to regard the forces that are for it, so long as they are diuided or weake: yet if at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny time they grow vnited, and so to be stronger, then haue they a mind if ability faile not, to fall a cropping, and to take them short betime. The better to take to their best aduantage, the occasion offered, all the <hi>Philistims</hi> came downe together: being <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> otherwise fiue Princes of them, and fiue seuerall Segniories; but now vniting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues all together, against those two Kingdomes of the people of God, newly vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. They came also with such confidence, that both they would seeke out <hi>Dauid</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ibid. 2. Sam 5: 18. 1. Chr. 14: 9.</note> (whom neuerthelesse they found soone enough to their purpose) &amp; did spread them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues all ouer a valley there. As touching their ouerthrow, it seemeth that first <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> had a care of the safety of his owne person: but then, it is plaine, that he bent him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe against them, and praeuailed. Hee seemed to haue a care of his owne person, in that so soone as he heard of their comming in, he went into a Fort or hould. He <note place="margin">2. Sam. 5: 17. 1. Chr. 11: 15.</note> bent himselfe notwithstanding against them, first by his seeking vnto God: then, by dealing with the enemy himselfe. His seeking to God was, whether he should goe <note place="margin">2. Sam. 5: 19. 1. Chr. 14: 10</note> and giue them battell: and whether God would so deliuer them into his handes. Whereunto hauing answere that hee should go, and that God would certainely deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer them into his handes, he accordingly went and preuailed against them, so plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">Ibid. 20, 21. 11, 12</note> and so thoroughly withall, that he thought it conuenient to leaue the place a name correspondent to the glory of him that so brake his enemies there: and whereas they had brought their Gods or Images with them, and left them there, those also hee burnt in the fire. In that other Story besides that seemeth to belong vnto this, wee are first to consider of the Story it selfe: then how it seemeth to bee as a member ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaining to this. The Story it selfe is, that <hi>Dauid</hi> thirsting and wishing for a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle <note place="margin">1. Chro. 11: 19-19.</note>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> water of the Well at <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> three of his company thereupon went thither, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding the <hi>Philistims</hi> then lay there, &amp; venturing their liues, as it were a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand to one, brought him water from thence: which notwithstanding he could not
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:7530:165"/> find in hir hart to drink when he had it, because it was gotten with so great hazard of their liues that did fetch it. A speciall good warming to many of vs, that make no conscience to feed and cloath our selues with that, which we haue not but by the bloud of others. That this story appertaineth into the other, &amp; is as it were a mēber of it may sufficiently apear by the description of the place &amp; time, where &amp; when it was done: <hi>Dauid</hi> being in the fort of <hi>Adullam</hi> (the same place whereunto he went <note place="margin">Ibid. 15, 16.</note> first for his safety) and the <hi>Philistims</hi> camping the selfe same time at <hi>Bathlehem</hi> also.

When hee employed himselfe about Religion, it was for the aduancement of it: wherein notwithstanding as there was somthing which he was allowed to do; so was there something againe, which was plainly forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den vnto him. That also which he was allowed to do, was not (by a default there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in) at the first receiued: but (the default being once amended) after it was. That which he was allowed to do, though it were not at the first receiued, was the brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of the Arke vnto <hi>Ierusalem:</hi> and so haue we therein to consider, first howe it was attempted and defeated; then, how it was againe attempted and performed. When it was first attempted, but not performed, we are to consider in what sort it was attempted: and how it came to passe it was not performed. Vnto the maner of attempting of it, there be two principall points appertaining: one, what consul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation was vsed before; the other, how they did set in hand with their businesse af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.

In that neuerthelesse they missed so farre, that all came to nothing in the end, we are to see, what it was wherein they missed: and how the whole solemnity was interrupted thereby.

In that <hi>Dauid</hi> did so take <note place="margin">2. Sa. 6: 8-10. 1. Chr. 13: 11-13.</note> it, and so left off for that time, he did not onely wisely on his owne behalfe, so to stay when he saw that God was offended, least he incurred some heauier displeasure: but withall he hath giuen a good example to others, not to run on in any rash or vnadui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed attempts of theirs, if at any time they be so crossed therein, as that well they may doubt (and that may they do, when their businesse is not of any sufficient warrant) that God is against them therein. When this businesse was againe attempted, and performed, we are in like sort to mark, how it was now attempted by them: and how it was withal performed. Attempted it was in better manner now then before: &amp; yet notwithstanding one good part of the action could not auoyd, but that needs it must be called in question. It was attempted in better manner now than before, bicause <hi>Dauid</hi> did now first learne what was to be done, before he set in hand to doe it. For now in the meane season he had learned, that none but the <hi>Leuites</hi> were to carry the <note place="margin">1. Chro. 15: 2.</note> Arke of God. And when he did set in hand with it afresh, we read of some prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for it before: then that they set in hand with the businesse it selfe. The preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for it before, was the place that <hi>Dauid</hi> prouided, and the Tent that he pitched for <note place="margin">1. Chr. 15. 1.</note> it. When hee set in hand with the businesse it selfe, first, we haue noted, what was the occasion of it: then in what manner he did it. The occasion of it was, that word was brought vnto <hi>Dauid,</hi> that the Lord had blessed <hi>Obed-Edom,</hi> and all that he had, <note place="margin">2. Sa. 6: 11, 12. 1. Chr. 13: 14.</note> since the time that the <hi>Arke</hi> had beene with him: which notwithstanding was but three monthes in all. A comfortable token, if not an vndoubted assurance, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer could rightly entertain the Gospell of Iesus Christ (the Arke of his testimony) <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> in such sort as he ought, he also and his should be blessed therby. His manner of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, was according as now he had learned, and much more carefull than before: <note place="margin">1. Chr. 15: 15.</note> both of bringing it into Ierusalem; and in that which he did thereabout, when hee had it there. To bring it to Ierusalem, he gathered all Israell togither againe: and by the way, both offered sacrifice, and vsed such tokens of speciall reioicing as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; <note place="margin">Ibid. 2. Sa. 6: 12-15. 1. Chr. 15: 4-14. 25-29.</note> especially <hi>Dauid</hi> himselfe, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>uer now and then, leaping and dauncing for ioy, euen into the Citty, and to that part of it where the Arke it selfe was to be placed. When he had it there, he did not onely for that present offer great Sacrifices, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stributed liberall portions to euery one of the people: but also for the time to come <note place="margin">2. Sa. 6: 17-19 1. Chr 16: 1-3. 1. Chr. 15: 16-24. 16▪ 4 42.</note> thence forward, he tooke very good order, to haue the Arke by the Priests and Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uites euer attended. That part of the action that could not auoyd but that needes it must be called in question, was, that speciall reioycing of <hi>Dauid:</hi> but yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing by himselfe defended. It was called in question, and very hardlie (euen scornfully) censured by <hi>Michal</hi> his wife, the daughter of <hi>Saul:</hi> who not conceiuing, <note place="margin">2. Sa. 6: 16-20. 1. Chr. 15. 29.</note> how a rare and extraordinary zeale might make strange motions in a man, and yet of no base quality withall, could take it none otherwise, but that he in lightnesse and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of mind, did that, which pure zeale, it seemeth rather, had wrought foorth in him, and had mede him so far to forget, to sustaine or beare vp a Princelike Maiestie among his people. For such a thing we finde in Christ himselfe, when he draue out <note place="margin">Iohn. 2. 14-16▪</note> the buyers and sellers out of the Temple: his Disciples maruelling (as it seemeth) that therein he grew so very hot, till they remembred such a place of the <hi>Psalmes,</hi> as <note place="margin">Ibid. 17.</note> put them in mind, that an extraordinary and speciall zeale, might readily put a man out of the wonted tenor or course of his wayes. The defence that <hi>Dauid</hi> vsed therin, was much confirmed by God himselfe: and so are we first to note, what was the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence that therin he vsed: then, how we may find it confirmed by God. The defence that therein he vsed, tendeth not only to iustifie that which he had don, because God <note place="margin">2. Sa. 6: 21, 22.</note>
               <pb n="311" facs="tcp:7530:166"/> had giuen him great cause so to reioyce, and therein to abase himselfe much more than yet he had done, and so he would: but something also to touch her, in that her Father and all his House was reiected, and hee placed there in his steede.

Forbidden vnto him it was, that shortly after hee would haue built a Temple to God: a purpose (to see too) so good in it selfe, and so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable generally withall men, that therein it shall be good more specially to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, how likely it was, that his would haue beene accepted; and in what sort it was refused. Likely it was, that his purpose would haue beene accepted, first in it selfe: then as it had other faire and likely commendation besides. In it selfe, the purpose was likely to be well accepted, as a token that he was desirous that God should dwel among them: and whereas he had but a Tent before, while the people were in theyr trauaile, and the people had houses now, who likewise had but Tentes before, it was in reason seemely and meete, that hee also now had an house among them. Those other faire and likely commendations it had besides, were two: one, arising from <hi>Dauid</hi> himselfe; the other, from the Prophet <hi>Nathan.</hi> That which arose from <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> himselfe, was, that he had a good mind in it, as appeareth by the words that hee vttered thereon: shewing thereby, that he had respect to the glory of God; and that <note place="margin">2.

That which arose from the Prophet <hi>Nathan,</hi> was, that he did like well of his purpose, and bad him do all that was in his <note place="margin">2. Sam. 7: 3. 1.

It was not therefore simply refused as a thing euill in it selfe, but in such sort as that <hi>Dauid</hi> counted, that the Lord dealt very graciously with him. First therefore of the refusall: then how well <hi>Dauid</hi> himselfe did take it. The refusal of it was not grieuous it selfe: and mingled besides with special comfort. It was not grieuous it self either in the matter: or in the maner of deliuery.

Which refusal may teach vs also, that whatsoeuer God himselfe doth not require, that is no matter for any of his people, to trouble their heads about: &amp; that, as such as haue shed bloud, are not meete men to build an house vnto the Lord; so if they be but men of war, that businesse were meet first to be finished, before the other might wel be dealt in. In the manner of deliuery, it was not grieuous neither, because it was refused the next day, before that <hi>Dauid</hi> had any time to set in hand with it, or <note place="margin">2. Sam. 7: 4, 5. 1 Chr. 17: 3. 4.</note> much to settle himselfe vnto it: and because the message was sent him by the Prophet a man of sufficient credit vnto him. That speciall comfort where-with it was mingled besides, was the signification of so speciall fauours of God, which was then imparted vnto him: both for himselfe; and for his posterity. For himselfe, that as God had bin <note place="margin">2. Sa. 7: 8-12. 1.

Where, if we marke, God hath laid forth what his imployments must be, both towards his owne people, and towards the enemy: towards his owne <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> people, to be their King and gouernor; and towards the enemy, euer to be working vpon him, at home and abroad, vntill he be cleane subdued.

Ais peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able estate is first set downe but very briefely: but some thinges thereof, a little after, some-thing more largely. Briefely it is saide, that hee raigned ouer all <hi>Israell,</hi> and <note place="margin">2. Sam. 8: 15. 1. Chr. 18: 14.</note> did execute iudgement and Iustice, to all his people. Those things that are set downe more largely, are two, and both of them works of thankfulnes, vnto certaine friends of his deceased: one, to <hi>Ionathan</hi> the Son of <hi>Saule,</hi> but a very faithfull friend to him; the other, to <hi>Nahash</hi> the late K. of the <hi>Ammonites.</hi> To <hi>Ionathan</hi> he bare so thankfull <note place="margin">2. Sa. 9: 1-13.</note> an hart, that he enquired for some of <hi>Sauls</hi> line, to whom he might shew some special fauour for <hi>Ionathans</hi> sake: and when by aspeciall seruant of <hi>Saul,</hi> he had come to the knowledge of <hi>Miphibosheth</hi> the son of <hi>Ionathan,</hi> he both restored him to the lands of <hi>Saul;</hi> and though he were but a lame man of both his feet, and so not so meete for a Princes Table, yet he allowed him at his owne boord for all his life long. And Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Princes haue found that friendship in Iesus Christ, and daily yet doe, that they ought to haue a speciall regard vnto the Ministery he hath left behinde him; and not to omit for some infirmity in them, at least to restore them to their ancient right, such as their Praedecessors iustly enioyed before; and not to abhor their company neither. <hi>Miphibosheth</hi> also, though hee were but a Cripple, yet was he a better Ornament at <hi>Dauids</hi> Table, than many other more personable men were able to bee, considering whereuppon it was that <hi>Dauid</hi> had him there: and the matter is plaine enough in it selfe, how it might be to that other applied. That which he did for <hi>Nahash</hi> his sake, the late King of the <hi>Ammonites,</hi> was not so well taken, as it was meant by him, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> so bred much businesse after: but such notwithstanding, as many of vs may fitly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to our selues. So are wee first to consider of the Story it selfe: and then to see how it may be to vs applyed. In the Story it selfe we are likewise to see, first, what it was that <hi>Dauid</hi> did: then, what businesse thereon ensued. That which <hi>Dauid</hi> did, was, that in friendship he would send Ambassadours to the new King <hi>Hanun,</hi> to comfort <note place="margin">2. Sa. 10: 1, 2. 1. Chr. 19: 1, 2.</note> him for the death of his Father. The businesse that ensued thereon, was, that they dealt very badly with <hi>Dauid</hi> againe: and that they were sharply punnished for it. Those that dealt so badly with him, were, first, the Princes of the <hi>Ammonites:</hi> then, <hi>Hanun</hi> the King himselfe. The Princes of the <hi>Ammonites</hi> put into the eare of the young King, that <hi>Dauid</hi> did not maane that friendship that he praetended: but vnder <note place="margin">2. Sam. 10▪ 3. 1.

The King vppon this their bad suggestion, giuing credite vnto them, did put them to a shamefull and vile disgrace, <note place="margin">2. Sam. 10: 4▪ 1.

<pb n="313" facs="tcp:7530:167"/> and curtayling their Garmentes by the middle, euen to their secrets; and so sending them away in a scorne.

How it may be to vs applyed, may soone be seene, first for the offence: then also, for the punishment of it. The offence with vs, is, that when Iesus Christ doth send vnto vs Ambassadours, in very peaceable and louing manner, especially now in these daies of the Gospell, wee already haue dealt much like with them, and dayly yet deale, as the <hi>Ammonites</hi> then did with those of <hi>Dauids:</hi> abasing theyr persons to the scornefull attempt of others, and controling their iust and needfull liuinges; and that so farre, that shame it is to see, to what pouerty and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse many of them are thereby brought. And as with them, it was first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gunne by the Princes, and after prosecuted by the King: so it is to bee doubted, that there were of our great men also, that could so ill abide, that those Seruaunts of GOD were so well prouided for as before they were, and yet no better than of right they ought (for of others wee speake not) that they were a great part of the cause, that they haue beene so abased and fleesed, as since they haue beene. But then our Princes may well bee discharged, that they haue not doone it in hatred of him that dooth send them: though for those also, it may bee doubted, that for theyr benefite they haue suffered themselues sometimes to be ouer-ruled therein; at least for the benefite of diuers of those that did attend them, or any way were in fauour with them. As for the punishment (God be thanked for it) we haue yet escaped rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably well: a day being already appointed, in which he will iudge the World by Fire. But well may wee doubt, that the Sonne of <hi>Dauid,</hi> Iesus Christ, may well haue some straine of his Father therein; detesting sinne, and giuen to Iustice, incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably more than <hi>Dauid</hi> was: and then, without quaestion it will bee hard to aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere it there. That many great houses also are since ouerthrowne, and none of that Line to inhaerit the Crowne, though there may bee other causes besides, yet may it prooue hard, to find any greater in eyther of them. There were good thinges in him (euen before God) who was first induced so to deale with his Cleargy here: and God likewise did vouchsafe him this fauour, that all his Children successiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly came to the Crowne. The like course hath beene continued since, vnder both <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> those that were of sounder profession: and, as it were, without intermission, but only in the daies of the middle-most of them, who though otherwise shee was not of so sound a profession, as either her Brother before, or her Sister after, yet may it seeme, that shee was as farre before them in speciall regard not to diminish the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Religion generally: as they were before her in the more speciall professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it. Howsoeuer it were, they all offended, eyther in the one, or in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: and as two of them tarryed but a short time among vs; so the other left no

               </gap>g Adultery and Murther together: in both which, considering of eyther of them a-part by themselues, we haue in particular diuers thinges worthy the marking. In his Adultery, first, how hee sell into it: then, how foule the fault was, by some other circumstances thereunto appertaining. It is plaine, that he fell into it, by want of good gouernment in himselfe: and first, as it seemeth, for that hee left ouer-much liberty and roome to the passion of lust to spring vp in him; then for that hee yeelded so much vnto it when it was sprung vp. It seemeth he left ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> liberty to the passion of lust to spring vp in him, by sequestring him-selfe from all good imploymentes so farre, that in the after-noone hee could take his bed, and <note place="margin">2. Sa. 11: 1, 2.</note> rest him there: his forces being then against the <hi>Ammonites,</hi> and he remaining at <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem.</hi> It may be indeede, hee had iust occasion so to doe; and that hee did it but moderately: but because such euill did followe on it, it may rather bee doubted, that himselfe was faulty therein. In that he yeelded so much to his passion when it was sprung vp, we haue noted vnto vs, first how it sprang vp: then, how he did yeeld vnto it. It sprang vp in him, partly by the vnaduised or inconsiderate doing of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other: and partly, by his owne folly concurring therewith. That inconsiderate do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">Ibid. 2, 3.</note> of another, was, that <hi>Vriahs</hi> Wife so washed or bathed her selfe, though (belike) but in her owne priuate, yet not so warily, but that <hi>Dauid</hi> from the roofe of his house, did espy her so washing. His owne follie concurring with that fact of hers, was, <note place="margin">Ibid. 3, 4.</note> that she fed his eyes with the view of her nakednesse and beauty, and so kindled such a lust in him, that he inquired of her, sent for her vnto him, and had the vnlawfull vse of her body. The circumstances that made this fact of his the fouler, are two: one, the consideration of the partie to whom this wrong was done; the other, that hee did it not so secretly, but that he made certaine of his owne, halfe-priuy vnto it. The party was an <hi>Hittite,</hi> one of the former people of the Land; but his Subiect nowe, <note place="margin">Ibid. 3, 11, 13.</note> occupyed in his Warres abroad; and, as it seemeth, and as he is accounted by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, the same that was one of his speciall Captaines. As hee was an <hi>Hittite,</hi> hee <note place="margin">2. Sam. 23: 39. <hi>Lyr. Ib. in lit. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Those that were sent for her, in reason might very wel suspect what was the matter; and so far by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe were made priuy vnto it: who likewise might bee offended at it, finding there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pet Martyr, Ibid. in vers.</hi> 4.</note> that hee was another manner of man, than they had otherwise thought him to haue beene. In the murther that he committed because it was done (and yet but in vaine) to hide his other sinne of Adultery, therefore haue wee set downe vnto vs, first, how he laboured otherwise to hide it: then, when otherwise he could not, how <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> he attempted that way to doe it. When he attempted otherwise to doe it, first, wee haue the occasion noted: then, in what manner hee did it. The occasion was, that <note place="margin">2. Sam. 11: 5.</note>
               <hi>Bethsabe</hi> sent him word, that she had conceiued; so that now the matter was like to come forth, if some remedy were not prouided: wherein if she had any ill meaning
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:7530:168"/> against her Husband, it is betwixt God and her; but sure it is, that such as are false to their Husbands, oft-times haue, and so might she haue also in this. The manner wherein he would haue done it, was to deuise, how it might be reputed her husbands: but because he failed therein, we are more specially to consider, first, how he attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it; then, how neuerthelesse he failed in it. He attempted it, by sending for her <note place="margin">Ibid. 11: 6.</note> Husband home from the Campe, as if he would vnderstand of him how things went there: and hauing talked with him (for a shew) a while of those matters, hee dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist <note place="margin">Ibid. 7, 8.</note> him home, and bad him rest and refresh himselfe there for the time; and when he perceiued that he went not home then, against the next night he vsed an inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate <note place="margin">Ibid. 12, 13.</note> meane to bring him vnto it. He failed in it, by a rare and straunge perswasion that <hi>Ʋriah</hi> had, God (as it seemeth) purposely crossing <hi>Dauid</hi> thereby: namely, that seeing the Arke of the Lorde was but in a Tent, and that <hi>Ioab</hi> the Generall, and all <note place="margin">Ibid. 9-11.</note> the Hoast lay in the fieldes, hee would not goe to his owne house to refreshe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe there, but take such part as the others did. A rare example, and sildome pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised, much lesse matched, by those that professe themselues to bee Souldiors, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the standard of Iesus Christ: as if <hi>Ioab</hi> therein should be much more happy then Christ himselfe; he hauing of his small Companies one, and Christ of many multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes none. When this way would not serue the turne, then he resolued on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, pitifully destroying a rare honest man, to hide his foule and loathsome sinne; <note place="margin">Ibid. 14-25</note> and that in such sort (ouershaddowing all with colours) as if there were no God in Heauen to discipher it out: and yet notwithstanding had so little hold of himselfe in that his impotent and vnbrideled lust, that the daies of her mourning for her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band <note place="margin">Ibid. 26, 27.</note> were no sooner past, but that he sent for her, and made her his wife: and so made it reasonable plaine, what was the body of all his other shaddowes before. A notable patterne, to how great iniquity men may fall, if they take not heed: and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> how obdurate they may bee therein, so long as GOD doth not vouchsafe them some speciall feeling. The trouble that befell him for this, is▪ first but denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced vnto him: but afterward executed on him. Why it was but denounced vnto him; first, there is as it were a way made thereunto: and then are those iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments themselues denounced. The way that is made thereunto, is, by charging him with his sinne, or conuincing him of it: at which time, because it was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged by <hi>Dauid,</hi> therefore are wee first to see, howe hee was conuinced of it; then, how it was acknowledged by him. Hee was conuinced of it, by the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable that <hi>Nathan</hi> the Prophet (beeing sent of the Lord, being now offended with <note place="margin">Ibid. 11: 27, 12: 1.</note> him for this his sin) did put vnto him: a parable of great force, to conuince vs also, in most of the thinges wherein wee offend. The parable was of a rich and poore man <note place="margin">Ibid, 12: 1-4</note> dwelling together, the rich man hauing great plenty of Cattle, both great and small, the poore man hauing but one poore I ambe, bought with his Mony, and nourished vp in his house: neuerthelesse, that the rich man hauing occasion to giue entertaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to a stranger that came vnto him, could not finde in his heart to take any of his owne, but tooke that poore mans sheep and dressed it to entertain his Guest withall. As also it is the manner of vs, not to hold our selues contented with the plenty that God hath giuen vs, but still to extend our desires farther, and sometimes to the poore store of those that are in meanest estate of all: as in those liuings that of right belong to the Cleargy, we haue a cleere and plaine example, very often invaded by others, and for the most part, by those that otherwise are best prouided; and lightly vnder this pretence, that otherwise they cannot keepe house. It was acknowledged by <hi>Dauid,</hi> first in this figure that was propounded: then shortly after, in the thinge it <note place="margin">Ibid. 5-9, 13</note> selfe. So was hee by degrees induced vnto it: and so must wee, otherwise likely neuer to yeeld, be we neuer so plainely conuinced. The iudgements that were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced against him, as at this time they were but denounced: so were they after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward executed also. As now they were but only denounced, they were mitigated or alayed with mercy: and so are wee seuerally to consider of both. In the denun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation of the Iudgementes likewise, wee haue the Iudgementes themselues, and the reason<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> thereof giuen. The Iudgementes themselues, were some of them threatened vnto him before hee professed any Repentaunce: and one of them
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:7530:169"/> after. Those that were threatned vnto him before he professed any repentance, are two: one, that the sword should ueuer depart from his house, all the daies of his life: <note place="margin">Ibid. 10. Ibid. 11.</note> the other, that GOD would raise euill vnto him out of his owne House; and one branch of it to be, an open &amp; shamelesse abuse of his wiues. And though these would bee heauy enough in themselues, going no farther but onely vnto the substaunce of them; yet is there such a manner of executing of them threatned withall, as dooth make them much more heauy: namely, that they should be openly done, a thing not onely irksome in it selfe to any offender, but so much the more grieuous to him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <note place="margin">Ibid. 12.</note> he was so careful as hee was, to haue kept his dooings from other mens eies. That other of them that was denounced vnto him after that he did professe repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, was that ouer and besides the others, the Childe whom so hee had gotten of <hi>Ʋriahs</hi> Wife, should certainely dye. The reasons giuen of those his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, are two, namely, that so dooing hee despised the LORD, and made the <note place="margin">Ibid. 14.</note> enemies to blaspheme: accounting (belike) that to bee despising of him, when <note place="margin">Ibid 10, 16.</note> that which GOD had giuen him, would not content him, but that hee would transgresse his worde for more; and that therefore the Enemies were made to blaspheme, because in that peece of seruice (the <hi>Ammonites,</hi> it seemeth, are meant, who then had hostility with them) they had by his so ordering the matter, praeuailed against them. In that these his iudgments were mitigated or alayed with mercy, wee haue specially noted, whereupon he was assured of any such fauour: and, what was the mercy or fauour assured vnto him. It was vpon the acknowledging of his sinne: and so are we, first to find that we do acknowledge our sinnes, before we make bold <note place="margin">Ibid. 13.</note> to looke for any such fauour towards vs. The mercy or fauour assured vnto him, was, <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> that the Lord likewise had pardoned that sinne vnto him, so that hee should not dye for it, or that he would not cast him off therefore: but yet directing him withal to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <note place="margin">Ibid. 14.</note> his offence to be such, as that those iudgements were so needfull chasticements for him, as that he was not to looke to escape them. Out of which our selues had <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> neede to gather, that though we be neuer so much the Children of God, yet if wee offend we may not look to escape chasticement here: and withall that God may and dooth fully forgiue the sinnes of those that are his, as touching aeternall wrath in the World to come; and yet in this World chastice them too, as to his wisedome from time to time, shall seeme most meet. When those iudgements came to be executed on him, we find that which was last denounced; first to be executed: and the cariage of <hi>Dauid</hi> to be such therein, as giueth good instruction to all. The execution of it <note place="margin">Ibid 15.</note> was, that <hi>Nathan</hi> being departed, the Lord strucke the Child that <hi>Ʋriahs</hi> Wife had borne him, so that it sickned, and a sennight after died. At which time the carriage <note place="margin">Ibid. 16-23.</note> of <hi>Dauid</hi> was such, that while the Child was sicke, <hi>Dauid</hi> gaue himselfe to fasting and Prayer: earnestly sorrowing for the Childe; and desiring God to giue it recouery, if so it might stand with his good pleasure. But when the Childe was dead (contrary to the expectation of his attendants) he then gaue ouer, and cheered himselfe; called for meate, and fell vnto it. A very good patterne, both to conuince of disorderly dealing to the contrary vsage: and to teach others, how to carry themselues in all such cases. As touching the others, namely, that the Sword should not depart from his house, and that, of his owne, trouble should arise vnto him, and both these not in secret manner, but in the open light of the Sun, we finde the same accomplished in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede by two of his Sons: <hi>Ammon</hi> the one; and <hi>Absolom</hi> the other. For <hi>Ammon</hi> fell into a vile and vnnaturall loue towards one of his own Sisters, by subtilty got her <note place="margin">2. Sa. 13▪ 1-19.</note> within his danger, by force tooke his beastly pleasure of her, and hating her extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after, sent her away with great despight, euen forcibly thrusting her out of his prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence. But so requited he his Fathers Adultery in another mans house, with abho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable Incest in his owne. The Story of <hi>Absolom</hi> is much the larger, being as he was more styrring of Nature, euer opposing himselfe against some: first, indeede, but against his aequals onely; but then against his Father and Soueraigne. His aequals we may account to be, his Brother <hi>Ammon:</hi> and his Fathers Generall of all his Anny, or chiefe Captaine, <hi>Ioab.</hi> His Brother <hi>Ammon,</hi> as we heard, had defloured by force his Sister <hi>Thamar,</hi> but halfe-Sister to him, and whole Sister to <hi>Absolom.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ibid. 20-28.</note>
               <pb n="317" facs="tcp:7530:169"/>
               <hi>Absolom</hi> therefore hating his Brother extreamely for it, but yet dissembling till hee could get some fit opportunity, in the end, inviting him to a Feast, treacherously and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> cruelly slew him; and himselfe for a time fled thereuppon: leauing not onely sorrow to his Father for the losse of his Sonne; but a good patterne withal, how inordinate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly priuate men will oft-times auenge out-raies committed, when Princes or Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates (on some priuate respect) forbeare to do it, by orderly Iustice. And if such a slip in <hi>Dauid</hi> (when also it was his owne Son, on whom Iustice was to be done) was thus corrected, it may be a good warning to others, to stand so much the cleerer in al such cases. That which hee did against <hi>Ioab</hi> was nothing so grieuous; but yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding much more, than he had deserued at his hands: and yet withall, both a reasonable good proofe of his bad and dangerous Nature; and a iust requitall to <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ab,</hi> who had endeauoured (not seeing his misdemeanor punnished first) to reconcile so vngracious an Imp to his Father againe. First therefore, how <hi>Ioab</hi> laboured his reconciliation: then, how he was requited for it. When he laboured it, he first had noted <hi>Dauid</hi> himselfe to be inclinable thereunto: &amp; thereupon began to set in hand <note place="margin">Ibid. 39. 14: 1.</note> with it. In that <hi>Dauid</hi> was so inclinable thereunto, it is an example of the loue of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents towards their Children, though they bee euill, or haue prouoked them much: and a good argument of the loue of God to bee much greater towardes vs, though we our selues be very much offensiue to him. Though thereupon he had good heart to set in hand with it, yet hee vseth the best meanes hee can, both in deuising what course should be held therein: and prouiding a fit Instrument to bee Actor in it. The course he deuised, was, to haue such a like thing to bee propounded vnto the King, wherennto he was like more readily to giue his consent: and that his consent, so gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen in that, he might the rather be concluded in the other. So the deuice was, that <note place="margin">Ibid. 14: 2-24.</note> a Woman should come vnto him, feigning her selfe to be a Widow, to haue left by her Husband two Sonnes onely, that falling out, the one of them slewe the other, that he that remained, was now earnestly required to be deliuered, to be put to death for slaying his Brother, that so shee should bee destitute of them both, and that her Husbands stocke should be extinct among the people, he leauing no other Issue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde him: therefore, that it would please the King, to vouchsafe his protection vnto that Sonne of hers that remained, as not slaying his Brother, but in such case as wherein by the Lawe of God it was not necessary that hee must dye; and therefore that the King might pardon it vnto him. <hi>Ioab</hi> therefore prouiding a Woman fit for such purpose, and so instructing her before, and she handling the matter accordingly, it fell out as he desired: <hi>Dauid</hi> yeelding himselfe now to be reconciled to <hi>Absolom</hi> again, though he suspected it to be the deuice of <hi>Ioab,</hi> and afterward found it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> and so allowing him to returne, euen to Hierusalem, but not to come in his sight as yet. How <hi>Ioab</hi> was for this requited, it followeth soone after. For the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spyring and restlesse nature of <hi>Absolom</hi> could not there stay, but needes must hee bee <note place="margin">Ibid. 28-33.</note> receiued into farther fauour: for the which cause sending for <hi>Ioab</hi> twice, and hee not comming thereon vnto him, hee sendeth his Seruants to burne vp a fielde of Corne that there he had neere vnto him. Whereuppon <hi>Ioab</hi> comming vnto him, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding his desire, he set in hand to obtaine that also, and did obtaine it; so that <hi>Absolom</hi> now was restored to his former fauour with his Father againe.</p>
            <p n="5">5 How hee bent himselfe against his Father and Soueraigne, is a matter of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> greater importance, wherein, after a sort, hee passed himselfe. For the businesse and trouble that he made his Father in his vngracious life, endured somewhat longer than himselfe, and was not extinct till after his death: and so may we account that which remained, to bee as it were an appurtenance vnto his owne Pageants going before. So to speake of his owne doinges first, they were of such Nature, that it pleased GOD notably to exercise and chasten his Father there-with: but yet hee praeserued him in the meane season; and fully acquited him thereof in the ende. Beeing of such Nature as might prooue so good and speciall an exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise and Chasticement to his Father, howsoeuer it was hee wrought against him, hee must needes bee a bad and a gracelesse Childe: a matter to bee so much
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:7530:170"/> the more regarded, for that otherwise he is noted to be so goodly a man for person <note place="margin">bid. 25. 27.</note> &amp; beauty, and to haue had comfortable Issue besides. But so it is diuers times seene, that very much euill is found in the goodliest persons that are: and that althogh the regard of their Issue should in such thinges bee a bridle vnto them, yet doth it little praeuaile with many. The working he had against his Father, was first but in secret: but afterward very open and plaine. While it was but in secret, he tooke vpon him more than any of the sonnes either of <hi>Saul</hi> or of <hi>Dauid</hi> (that we reade of) had done before, and busily sought to creepe into credit with the people. He tooke vpon him more than others, in that hee got him Chariots and Horses, and a Gard of fifty men <note place="margin">Ibid. 15: 1</note> to run before him. Hee sought to creepe into credit with the people, by behauing <note place="margin">Ibid. 2-6.</note> himselfe popularly, praetending a speciall care of all their affaires, and imparting cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous salutations to all. When hee meant to breake forth into open Rebellion, and to shew himselfe in his coulours, he thought good to get him out of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> where his being then was, and to be somewhat farther from his Father and from the Court: and then set in hand with his businesse. So vnder praetense of going to performe a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> vow he had made when he was in banishment, hee got without suspicion to <hi>Hebron:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ibid. 7-9, 11, 12.</note> and by the same praetense got many thither besides, such as he hoped would conceiue well of the course he had in hand. Being gotten thither, first he began his businesse there: then, forthwith he went to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> there to follow further vpon it, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready hee had begun it. At <hi>Hebron</hi> he so dealt with his confederates by priuy Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers, that it then appeared to be a strong packe that he had made: himselfe then <note place="margin">Ibid. 10-12.</note> making open claime to the Kingdome; and the people repairing fast vnto him. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong whom some there were whom he specially invited thither vnto that praetended feast of his: two huudred of the inhabitants of <hi>Ierusalem;</hi> and <hi>Achitophel,</hi> one of <hi>Dauids</hi> Counsellers. Those of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> hee called with him▪ belike but as it were <note place="margin">Ibid. 11.</note> for a stale: that being once noyced, that so many of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> were with him▪ o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers might be the readier to come in too. For the Text doth beare them witnesse that they knew not of it before. <hi>Achitophel</hi> likewise it seemeth he was desirous to <note place="margin">Ibi. 12. 16: 23.</note> haue, for the great opinion that was conceiued of the sharpnesse and depth of his iudgement, in giuing aduise; and so it was both with <hi>Dauid</hi> before, and with <hi>Abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lom</hi> after: who accordingly came, and ioyned with him. At <hi>Ierusalem</hi> (whither it seemeth, they presently sped themselues, to surprize the King ere he should be aware: <note place="margin">Ibi. 16: 15, 20.</note> for, hee being already fled, <hi>Achitophel</hi> would haue followed after, in hope to haue gotten him the selfe same might) laying their heads together what was to be done, they resolued on the course they would hould, for two principall matters: one, that the people who tooke <hi>Absoloms</hi> part neede not to doubt any reconciliation betwixt the Father and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>he Sonne, so to make them faster to <hi>Absolom;</hi> the other, how they might best persue the King, being (as he was) fled from <hi>Ierusalem</hi> already, and they not knowing as yet where to haue him. For the former of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>se, the aduise of <hi>Achi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tophel</hi> onely was taken: namely, that whereas <hi>Dauid</hi> had left certaine Concubines of <note place="margin">Ibid. 15▪ 16.</note> his to keepe his house in his absence, <hi>Absolom</hi> should go and take the vse of their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies <note place="margin">Ibi. 16: 21, 22.</note> in so open and shamelesse manner, that the people might be out of doubt, that he had don his Father that vilany indeede; and so not likely euer to be reconciled again. A very good patterne how naughty matters once taken in hand, must often haue ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> odious and vnnaturall villanies committed too, to helpe them forward, or to prop vp their proper bodies, least praesently they ruinate themselues or come to the ground.

               <note place="margin">Ibid. 17: 1-4.</note> taken, it had beene very likely that <hi>Dauid</hi> indeede had beene deuoured thereby. But then <hi>Chusay</hi> (being a secret friend vnto <hi>Dauid)</hi> aduised them rather to take <note place="margin">Ibid. 5-13.</note> more time, shewing how so they might worke so surely, that hee could in no wife es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape them: and that the other which <hi>Achitophel</hi> moued, stoode ouermuch on doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full hazard.

But now hauing seene what <note place="margin">Ibid. 23.</note> was intended against him, we are likewise to see, howe it pleased God to preserue him: first, that he was not surprized <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>
               <hi>Ierusalem;</hi> then, that he was not that night ouertaken in the way as he fled. That hee was not surprized in <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> these were two meanes whereby it pleased God to preserue him: one, the intelligence that was brought him, when the conspiracy brake out at <hi>Hebron;</hi> the other, his present flight thereupon. In that he had so ready worde of it, when first it began, it is rather to be altogether and wholy imputed vnto the meere prouidence of God, <note place="margin">Ibid. 15: 13.</note> than any thing at all to <hi>Dauids</hi> watchfulnesse, who was so affectionate vnto his son, that it is most likely, hee neuer suspected any such thing by him: and it sheweth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> withall, that <hi>Absolom</hi> was in this case nothing so wary, in such sort to haue kept the Citty, as that no word might haue been carried out of it to the hinderance of their businesse, as <hi>Iehu</hi> afterward in the like case was; though he had time to haue cast <note place="margin">2. King. 9: 15.</note> for it before, and <hi>Iehn</hi> did it euen then on the sudden. In his flight we are to consider that it pleased God that way to preserue him: and then, in what manner it was. That God woulde but that way preserue him, it is plaine, that God was disposed much to humble him thereby: all flight beeing in it selfe so dishonourable; but in this no lesse, than the King to flee from the face of his subiect, and the father from the face of his childe. As touching the manner of it, his flight was, so farre as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth to this part of the story, till hee was gotten ouer <hi>Iordan;</hi> so hauing two principall parts, first to <hi>Bahurim;</hi> then, ouer <hi>Iordan.

Vnto which place wee haue appertaining diuers particular stories; but none in his passage then ouer <hi>Iordan.</hi> As he went to <hi>Bahurim,</hi> besides the addressing himselfe to his iourney at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> hee was most of all occupied in parting with friends till he came to the top of Mount <hi>Oliuet:</hi> but after that, he had certaine occurrents of another kind. Addressing himself to his way, he vsed speede (both he and the company he had about him) leauing the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stody <note place="margin">2. Sam. 15: 14-18.

Whether a figure heerein of Christ, or not I cannot say: but Christ followed the selfesame way in sorrow after, he and his Apostles together; that <hi>Dauid</hi> and his company, weeping, and sorrowing, thus traced before. Of those friends that hee was to part withall, one there was that would in no wise leaue him: but others there were, that did. He that would in no wise leaue him was <hi>Ittay</hi> a stranger, hauing sixe hundered men vnder his charge: <note place="margin">Ibid. 19-22.</note> who, as it seemeth, came of good-will but a little before to see the King, and that therfore the King was sorry he should light on so troublesom a time, and thereupon desired him now to returne; which notwithstanding he constantly refused to doo. A matter worth the marking also, that whereas his owne people▪ yea and his sonne <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> whom himselfe did so dearely affect, so vnnaturally bent themselues against him, God gaue him so faithfull an heart in this stranger, that, to die for it, hee would not forsake him, nor by any entreaty of the King himselfe, leaue him in the case that now he was in. The Priests and <hi>Chusay</hi> were the others, that, beeing dismissed did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly take their leaues of him.

Being now past the top of mount <hi>Olinet,</hi> wee are first to see what was done by the way: then, what was done at <hi>Bahurim,</hi> where he made some little aboad. By the way, he was haunted with two false Varlets, both appertaining before to the house of <hi>Saul: Ziba,</hi> and <hi>Shimey.

               <note place="margin">Ibid. 16: 1-4.</note> as making a ready way to his owne aduancement: and so cuningly handled <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi>

An example of greater credulity without further tryall, than were to be wished in any so rare a man as he. <hi>Shimey</hi> sought for naught at his hands, but onely to disgorge, as it seemeth (hauing then gotten the aduantage of the place) <note place="margin">Ibid. 5-13.</note> his long hidden malice against him, and the vile conceit he had taken of him, as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching his comming vnto his Kingdome: railing vpon him about the same, exceeding fouly; and accompanying his wordes with actuall behauiour correspondent. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch that there were of <hi>Dauids</hi> company, that would gladly haue gone, to haue beene reuenged of him, but that <hi>Dauid</hi> would not suffer them.

            <p n="6">6 How it pleased God, hauing praeserued <hi>Dauid</hi> hitherto fully to acquite him of this businesse in the end, that wee may the better find, wee are first to consider, to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> how strong an head it grew against him: then, how it pleased God, neuerthelesse to rid him of it. It grew to so strong an head against him, that when <hi>Dauid</hi> had giuen place vnto them, not onely getting him ouer <hi>Iordan,</hi> but there also leauing them two partes of three, of that part of the Countrey that was on the other side: yet needes would they follow him, and by force ouerlay him there. In what number they came against him, it is not set downe particularly: but it is said generally, that all the men of <hi>Israell</hi> came with <hi>Absolom</hi> ouer <hi>Iordan,</hi> that hee made <hi>Amasa</hi> his Generall ouer <note place="margin">Ibid. 24-26.</note> his Army, &amp; pitched in <hi>Gilead,</hi> South, as it seemeth, from the Citty <hi>Manahim</hi> where <hi>Dauid</hi> was, in the most Northerly part of <hi>Gilead.</hi> At which time neyther can we tell what company had repaired to <hi>Dauid.</hi> But first there were certaine principall men <note place="margin">Ibid. 27-29. 19: 32.</note> in those partes (one of the <hi>Ammonites,</hi> and two of the <hi>Israelites)</hi> that did helpe to maintaine him and his company there; and he had so many, that he made three bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels <note place="margin">Ibi. 18: 1-4, 6.</note>

<pb n="321" facs="tcp:7530:171"/> his forces themselues went forth to giue battaile vnto the others. And as in these comforts, in the meane season, it pleased God to giue him good hope of riddance now, so did hee a little after performe it: making a faire riddance of his enimies; and so framing the hearts of the people, that soone after they sought vnto him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. In the ouerthrowe of his enemies, though God vouchsafed him speciall fauour: yet himselfe, by his immoderate affections, had almost missed of the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of it.

The appurtenance that followed, after this Pageant of <hi>Abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loms</hi> going before, was that other businesse that fell out immediately after, when much of the people reuolted afresh <hi>Dauid</hi> againe. Concerning which, because it dependeth vpon some part of the Story of <hi>Dauids</hi> returne to <hi>Ierusalem</hi> again, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are we first to consider of that part of his returne: and then to take this other in the place where it selfe ariseth. <hi>Dauid</hi> therefore now bethinking himself of his returne, and fearing that his owne Tribe (which was the Tribe of <hi>Iudah)</hi> woulde come somewhat short, because of those aforesaide reasonings which he had hearde <note place="margin">Ibid. 11-13</note> the <hi>Israelites</hi> had of him before, sent vnto <hi>Zadok</hi> and <hi>Abiathar</hi> the Priests, both to put the Tribe of <hi>Iudah,</hi> that they were not slacke in that point of duty: and to assure <hi>Amasa,</hi> the sate Generall of <hi>Absoloms</hi> forces, of speciall fauour at his handes also. Which dealing of his tooke such effect, that first the whole Tribe of <hi>Iudah</hi> yeelded <note place="margin">Ibid. 14. Ibid. 20: 4, 5.</note> to receiue him againe, and sent him word to addresse himselfe homeward: <hi>Amasa</hi> also it seemeth, was thereby won vnto him, for that a little after we finde that hee was in speciall credit with <hi>Dauid.</hi> Not much vnlike vnto it, it is, that in these daies of the Gospell, Christ doth admonish the people of Christendom (that are neerest to him by profession) by the Ministry of his Priests, to take heede that they be not slacke, now to receiue him againe, comming (as he doth) in his worde vnto them,
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:7530:172"/> least they bee praeuented by others, which could not bee but vnto great dishonour to them. It may bee also, that hee hath some such speciall dealing with cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine principall Leaders of the <hi>Turkes</hi> and Heathen, as may bring in many of them and much people them in such sort, as that first wee may see them to bee in speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all place with him, before that euer wee heare of their comming in vnto him. By this meanes the Tribe of <hi>Iudah</hi> (and some others with them) came so speedily in (God grant to these others such readinesse also) that they both came to the King before he came ouer <hi>Iordan,</hi> and praeuented the <hi>Israelites</hi> therein: the most of them indeede to do this point of duty; but some of them hauing another errant besides. Those that came to do this point of duty indeede, were the Tribe of <hi>Iudah;</hi> specially <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> stirred vp therunto from the King himselfe, though but by the Ministery of the Priests: <note place="margin">Ibi. 19: 15, 17.</note> but yet accompanied with halfe of the children of <hi>Israell</hi> (such belike as had taken <note place="margin">Ibid. 40.</note> part with him against <hi>Absolom,</hi> and so were with the King before) one of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany being of speciall reckoning besides. Those that had some other arrant were <hi>Shimey,</hi> certainely for the one; and <hi>Ziba,</hi> it seemeth, for the other: the former of <note place="margin">Ibid. 16, 17.</note> them bringing a thousand men with him, of his owne Tribe the Ttibe of <hi>Beniamin:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ibid. 17.</note> the other also something ruffling it, as it seemeth, with his fifteene Sons and twenty Seruants. For <hi>Shimey</hi> came to begge pardon for his life, for that hee had so rayled on the King before, which also he did and obtained: and <hi>Ziba</hi> it seemeth, with that <note place="margin">Ibid. 18-23.</note> officiousnesse of his, would retaine that fauour with the King, which before hee had naughtily gotten, by accusing his Maister falsely vnto him. That one man of the <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites,</hi> which was of speciall reckoning besides, was <hi>Barzillai,</hi> one of the Tribe of <hi>Gad,</hi> who had done much for the King in this his distresse, and now with the rest at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended him ouer <hi>Iordan</hi> also. Of this man wee haue two thinges specially noted: one, of his age; another of his good moderation. Of his age it is sayd, that he was a very old man, and yet but fourscore yeares old: whereby wee may see, that it is not so cleere (as wee are commonly perswaded) that in the former ages before vs, men <note place="margin">Ibid. 32.</note> liued longer than they do now generally: when as at that time fourscore yeares were counted so great an age. His moderation was such, that though hee had deserued very well of the King, and the King accordingly would haue had him to the Court, <note place="margin">Ibid. 32-39.</note> to requite his good-will with kindly cherishing of him there: yet beeing of those yeares he did wisely refuse it, as a thing more meete for him then, to learne to dye at home, than to begin at the Court so freshly (as it were) to liue againe. A iust and needfull reproofe vnto the dotage of many of vs, that haue so greene tops in so rotten stockes, as with vs oft-times it is seene. The King being thus brought ouer <hi>Iordan</hi> went thence to <hi>Gilgal:</hi> attended thither by the Tribe of <hi>Iudah,</hi> and by halfe of the <note place="margin">Ibid. 40.</note>
               <hi>Israelites</hi> besides. At whih time and place began the broyle that now wee speake off: concerning which we are to see, first how it was begun; then, how it was ended againe. It was begun, partly by all the whole company generally: then, by one of them more specially. Of all the whole company the <hi>Israelites</hi> first expostulated with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> the King and their brethren of the Tribe of <hi>Iudah,</hi> that they praeuented them in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">Ibid. 41, 43.</note> home the King, before they had made them priuy vnto it, that so they might haue done it with the generall consent of all, and none to haue beene more forward therein than their fellowes: especially they being the greater part, &amp; so hauing more interest in the King than the others. The Tribe of <hi>Iudah</hi> did stand vpon their nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer affinity, as well as they might: but then they added more fiercenesse of speach <note place="margin">Ibid. 42, 43.</note> then they needed, or was wisedome for them to haue done; especially, hauing, as they had, the better end of the cause it selfe. That one man to whom the beginning of it may bee more specially imputed, was <hi>Sheba,</hi> of the Tribe of <hi>Beniamin,</hi> a man of speciall reckoning with the rest, as it seemeth, but factious withall: who blowing the trumpet, and stirring vppe the people to renounce <hi>Dauid</hi> and to depart to their <note place="margin">Ibid. 20: 1, 2.</note> tents againe, so praeuailed he with all the whole multitude of the <hi>Israelites,</hi> that they all followed him, and left the Tribe of <hi>Iudah</hi> onely remaining with <hi>Dauid.</hi> So that now those also, it seemeth, that before tooke part with <hi>Dauid,</hi> did cleane giue him ouer, and went with the rest: insomuch that now the <hi>Beniamites</hi> also (it seemeth) left him, who were wont to cleaue to the house of <hi>Dauid</hi> before. For <hi>Sheba</hi> the Ring-leader
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:7530:172"/> was of that Tribe, and so the likelier to draw them away: and the whole mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of the <hi>Israelites,</hi> before accounting but of ten partes onely, doe in a manner <note place="margin">Ibid. 19: 43</note> plainely grant, that <hi>Beniamin</hi> was with <hi>Iudah</hi> then. But now the Text saith (and <note place="margin">Ibid. 20: 2. <hi>

So haue we heare a speciall example of the great brittlenesse and muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility that is in man: one sort of thē reasoning a little before, that <hi>Dauid</hi> ought to be <note place="margin">Ibid. 19: 9, 10.</note> their K. and so concluding against themselues, but vpon a trifling occasion forsaking him nowe; the residue of them venturing their liues with <hi>Dauid</hi> before against all their Bretheren, and now reuolting with that one man onely (and he but a bad one) <note place="margin">Ibid. 20: 1.</note> vpon no vrgent necessity at all. Neuerthelesse this great storme was reasonable ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily ouer-blowne; and yet it shall be good to note the manner of it: the most of the Story thereunto appertaining, shewing but in what sort it was suppressed or quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched againe; but part of it deliuering another accident that fell out in the dooing of it. That part of the Storie that goeth no farther but onely to shew howe it was suppressed, dooth first shewe what time was taken vnto it: then, in what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> it was accomplished. The time was so taken, that neyther did <hi>Dauid</hi> foorth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with make after him at that praesent: neyther yet did hee put it off any long time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. If praesently hee had doone it, it had not beene vnlike, but that much blood had beene shed about it, in that hot blood wherein they were then: and therefore wee read, that hee went to Hierusalem first, before hee did any thing against them; <note place="margin">Ibid. 3.</note> but by likely-hoode hee sped himselfe thither without delay, as also the Tent ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth no mention of any thing that fell out in the way. But comming to Hierusalem <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> he did but first shut vppe those Concubines of his with whom <hi>Absolom</hi> had laine, so to continue to the day of theyr death (a matter of no long nor busie dispatch) but that praesently he tooke order for the other: first willing <hi>Amasa</hi> (who in the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse <note place="margin">Ibid. 4, 5.</note> of <hi>Absolom</hi> was against him, and the Generall of all his forces) to assemble his Forces of the Tribe of <hi>Iudah</hi> in three dayes, and himselfe then to repaire vnto him againe; then, when <hi>Amasa</hi> came not at the time appointed, and doubting least <note place="margin">Ibid. 6.</note>
               <hi>Sheba</hi> by drift of time should grow harder to be dealt withall, appointing <hi>Abishay, Ioabs</hi> Brother, to take such as were ready at hand, and to followe vppon that Rebell to cut him off, before hee grewe to farther strength. So it seemeth, that <hi>Dauid</hi> could so ill brooke <hi>Ioab</hi> nowe for <hi>Absoloms</hi> sake, that as yet hee could not commit <note place="margin">Ibid. 7.</note> the charge vnto him. So <hi>Abishay</hi> went for-ward, and with him all such (belike) as were then ready. For wee read, that both <hi>Amasa,</hi> and <hi>Ioab</hi> too, were in this expedition: but it seemeth, that <hi>Amasa</hi> came in with those that he had gotten some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what after, and yet but a little; and that <hi>Ioab</hi> himselfe (for his companyes went with his Brother) went now as voluntary, eyther to helpe forward the seruice it selfe or to recouer his fauour with <hi>Dauid</hi> againe. Nowe <hi>Sheba</hi> whom they sought, was not found of them till they came to <hi>Abell,</hi> a Citty in the Tribe of <hi>Nepthalim,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most <note place="margin">Ibid. 14: <hi>Chr.

But finding him there, they praesently besiedged <note place="margin">Ibid. 14, 15.</note> the Cittie, and in such sort fell to their businesse, that the Inhabitantes perceiued they might looke for no mercy nor fauour to themselues nor theyr Citty, vnlesse they tooke some order with them to theyr contentment. A certaine Woman <note place="margin">Ibid. 16-19.</note> therefore comming to the Wals, put <hi>Ioab</hi> in minde, with what moderation such as warred vppon any Citty should by the Lawe of GOD prosecute the same. For <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> though <hi>Abishay</hi> were appointed by the King: yet <hi>Ioab,</hi> it seemeth, as he was indeed better knowne, and of greatest reckoning in Martiall affaires, so was hee most ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted of heere. Whereas now therefore they came in such heat against the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell, that they besiedged the Citty, and began to ruinate or ouer-throw the Walles, before they had any way assayed, whether they would in peaceable manner yeelde their demaund: they amend that course now, and promise to proceede no farther in <note place="margin">Ibid. 20, 21.</note> hostile manner against them, if they will deliuer the Rebell vnto them.

               <pb n="324" facs="tcp:7530:173"/> cut off the head of <hi>Sheba,</hi> and cast it ouer the Wall to <hi>Ioab:</hi> and he likewise hauing so dispatched his businesse, blew the retrait, and so departed. That other accident that fell out in the doing of this, was, that by the way as they were going in this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition, <hi>Ioab,</hi> perceiuing belike, that <hi>Amasa</hi> now was like to be in such place with <hi>Dauid,</hi> as wherein he was before, treacherously slew him by the way. The subtilty <note place="margin">Ibid. 8-10.</note> whereby he sought to compasse it, was, as it seemeth, of purpose to haue such a wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon about him then, as easily would fall out of the Sheath, that so walking with <hi>Amasa,</hi> when his Weapon should seem by chance to fall out, he might take oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to speed <hi>Amasa</hi> with it before he was ware, as also hee did: whereas if he had at any time but offered to haue drawn it, as in such case men commonly do, it is not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely but that <hi>Amasa</hi> thereupon would haue espyed it, and so haue stood to his own defence. But yet that this accident should not any thing hinder the seruice, by the peoples staying about that, hee did not forget euen then to take order: which also <note place="margin">Ibid. 11-13.</note> was accordingly obserued.</p>
            <p n="7">7 Those others wherein <hi>Dauids</hi> offence was not so apparant, but that in the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Iudgement of men it were likely enough to haue gone vntouched, were two: one, a want of a peece of Iustice; another, a kinde of glorying in the multitude of his people. In the former of which wee are to consider, what fault it was that <hi>Dauid</hi> made: and, how it pleased GOD to take it. To finde out the fault that hee made, we are first to consider what it was that he did: then, what respects or considerations <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> there were, that might seeme much to excuse him, or to lessen the fault vnto him. That which hee did, was but of omission, or not doing a thing that was to be done: namely, that whereas <hi>Saul</hi> had destroyed certaine of the <hi>Gibeonites,</hi> on zeale to the <note place="margin">Ibid. 21: 1, 2.</note> people, or to please them; <hi>Dauid</hi> yet (all the time of his raigne hitherto) had doone no Iustice for the punnishment of it. Those considerations that might seeme to excuse <hi>Dauid,</hi> or much to lessen the fault vnto him, were of two sorts: one of the time; others, of the thing it selfe. That one of the time, was, that it was done long before <hi>Dauids</hi> time: and then both he might bee ignorant of it; and, if he did know it, yet might he probably thinke, that he stood not charged with the punnishment of it. Those others that are of the thing it selfe, are two; one, arising of the considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of those that should be auenged; the other, of the consideration of those on whom they were to bee auenged. Those that were to bee auenged, were none of the people of <hi>Israell</hi> themselues, but onely a people that dwelt among them: such <note place="margin">Ibid. 2. Ios 10: 2.</note> as by the generall direction that God had giuen his people before, should haue been cleane destroyed with the rest of the <hi>Cannanites</hi> (of which race they were) sauing that <hi>Iosuah</hi> and the rest of the Elders of <hi>Israell</hi> had long since made peace with them; <note place="margin">Ios. 9: 3-15.</note> yet not otherwise but as with Strangers, and circumuented by their subtile dissimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Those on whom they were to be auenged, were the Issue of <hi>Saul:</hi> on whom hee might not doe any Iustice, especially such as might tend to take away their liues, but that it might probably be thought, that he did but pick a quarrel against them, to make his own estate more sure, by taking the line of the other away. Neuerthelesse it pleased the lord in such sort to take it, that both he plagued the whol land with dearth <note place="margin">1. Sa. 21: 1-14.</note> three yeares together, and yet neuer told them all that while (that we read of) what the cause was why he was so offended with them: and when <hi>Dauid</hi> at the length in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of the Lord, what the cause should be (which also was not till the three years end: a good patterne, how long it is, in our distresse, before that euer we seek to the Lord; and if it were so long with <hi>Dauid,</hi> then is it like to be longer with vs) he would not then with-draw his hand, vntill the fault were first amended. A good example to all to take heede both of dealing hardly with any, though they be not neere vnto <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> vs; or but to be of such an humour towardes them, as that it pleaseth vs well when they are hardly dealt with: and of breaking faith with any of those to whom wee haue giuen it, though otherwise our selues may conceiue, that some way or other they are vnwoorthy. More specially also, a faire warning it is, to moderate those profane courses of many that in these dayes are ouer-much vsed, dayly more and more decaying the Ministery: a Function and people, that in many good respectes, ought to be of much better account with vs; than those <hi>Gibeonites</hi> needed to haue
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:7530:173"/> beene with them. That which I noted to bee of glorying in the multitude of his people, hath another speciall Story appertaining: so that first wee are to consider of this his glorying; then, of that other that hangeth on it. In his glorying there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wee are first to consider, what was the fault that now hee made: then▪ what was the displeasure of GOD against him for it. In the fault that hee made, wee haue first set downe the occasion of it: then, the fault it selfe. The occasion of it was, that the LORD was againe offended with <hi>Israell:</hi> whereby we may see, that <note place="margin">2 Sam. 24: 1.</note> the offences or slidinges of Princes, are some-times occasioned by the sinne of the people. In the fault it selfe wee haue likewise set downe in this, how hee was inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced or tempted vnto it: then, how he did accordingly yeeld. He was tempted vnto it <note place="margin">Ibid. &amp;. 1. Chr. 21: 1.</note> by Sathan: who oft-times vseth the euill that is in vs to our own ouerthrow; though wee also haue in our selues matter enough for all kinde of temptation, though hee neuer meddle to helpe vs forward. Vnto which temptation <hi>Dauid</hi> did so fully yeeld, that he did not onely set <hi>Ioab</hi> and, the Gouernours of the people a worke, to <note place="margin">2. Sa. 24: 3, 4. 1. Chr. 21: 2 4.</note> goe forth-with and number the people throughout the whole Land: but also, when <hi>Ioab</hi> was afraid it would turne ill to the King, and therefore endeuoured to disswade him from it, was so very peremtory notwithstanding therein, that <hi>Ioab</hi> and the others (though full sore against their wils) were faine to doe it. At which time it was found, that they came to the summe of able men meete for the Warres (notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <note place="margin">1.

What was the displeasure of God against him for it, that we may the better find, we are to consider, that <hi>Dauid</hi> was in such case then, as that we may easily conceiue, that God would not be offended with him, and yet that he was: then, how far the same proceeded against him. <hi>Dauid</hi> was in such case then, as that wee might easily conceiue that God would not be offended with him, because himselfe was sorry for it immediatly after: &amp; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, <note place="margin">2. Sa. 24: 10. 1. Chr. 21: 8.</note> both confessed it plainely; and did aske forgiuenesse of it. The course that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthelesse God tooke against him, was, that hee would in no wise altogether spare him for it; but yet gaue him his choyce, whether he should chastice him with the selfe same scourge that was then on the Land: or that hee would take his choice of a cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of others. The scourge that was then on the Land, was that famine wee heard off before: which now had been on the Land three yeares already, and a good pecce of the fourth, as it seemeth, for that iustice was not done to the <hi>Gibeonites.</hi> Whereunto now should be added for this, three yeares mo: so to make vp seauen in all.

Chro. 21: 13, 14</note> two whereof he might take his choyce likewise, were, eyther three monthes to fly before his enemies: or three daies Pestilence throughout the Land. Whereupon when <hi>Dauid</hi> made choyce of the Pestilence rather, so to fall in the hands of God, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than into the hands of men, there dyed thereof in three dayes, threescore and ten thousands throughout the land. That other Story that hangeth on this, is, how it was found, that Ierusalem was the place spoken of before, that the Lord would make choice of it, to put his name there, and whether his people had to bring their Obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions <note place="margin">Deut. 12: 5-7.</note> and sacrifices: the knowledge whereof seemeth to be farther imparted to <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid,</hi> than now we haue any Scripture for it. First therefore wee are to see, what wee haue extant to induce him vnto it: then, how hee, for that matter, resolueth. That which we finde extant now, which he had then to induce him vnto it, resteth in two principall pointes: one, the direction hee had from the Prophet; the other, the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse he had from God. In the direction hee had from the Prophet, wee haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered vnto vs, first vppon what occasion it was: then, what was the direction
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:7530:174"/> it selfe. The occasion was, that the Angell of Gods wrath, who had now already destroyed those threescore and ten thousand by the pestilence, among the people, <note place="margin">2. Sam. 24: 16, 17. 1▪ Chro. 21: 15-17.</note> was now sent by God himselfe to <hi>Ierusalem</hi> also, to make the like destruction there: yet that the Lord had compassion, and stayed him; when <hi>Dauid</hi> acknowledged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to be the offender, and desired God to spare them and lay it on him. The di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection it selfe that heereupon <hi>Gad</hi> the Prophet gaue vnto <hi>Dauid;</hi> was, as the Angell <note place="margin">2. Sa 24: 18. 1. Chro. 21: 25, 18.</note> bad him do in the name of the Lord: namely to go and erect an Alter vnto the Lord, in the threshing flower of <hi>Araunab</hi> or <hi>Ornan</hi> the <hi>Iebusite,</hi> where the Angel then was. In the successe that <hi>Dauid</hi> had from God, we are are first to see, how he followed the direction giuen him, wherein he had the successe we speake off: then, the successe he had therein. His direction hee followed so well, that praesently hee went about it: <note place="margin">2. Sam. 24: 19-25 1. Chro. 21: 19-26.</note> and although the <hi>Iebusite</hi> would freely haue giuen him the ground it selfe and Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices too, yet <hi>Dauid</hi> would not so, but would first giue him the valew threof, and so did; and then built his Alter there, and offered Sacrifices thereon. The successe that he had therein, was, that the Lord did graciously accept of his offerings at that <note place="margin">1. Chr. 21: 26. Leuit 9: 24 2. Sa. 24: 25. 1. Chr. 21: 27. 1. Chr. 22: 1-4.</note> praesant, sending fire from heauen to receiue them, as he did when the Tabernacle was first erected: and was so appeased towardes the whole Land, that thencefor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the plague likewise ceased. The resolution of <hi>Dauid</hi> heereupon was, that that place was the house of the Lord, or the place where he would be worshipped, or where the Temple was to bee builded: and so accordingly hee forthwith set in hand to make prouision. That little businesse that was occasioned by another, was that <hi>Adoniah,</hi> one of <hi>Dauids</hi> Sonnes, and as it seemeth the eldest of them now (of <note place="margin">1. King. 1: 5-49.</note> those that were left) with the aduise and helpe of <hi>Ioab Dauids</hi> chiefe Captaine, and <hi>Abiathar</hi> the Priestes, when <hi>Dauid</hi> was laid and not like to continue, without the consent or priuity of <hi>Dauid,</hi> began to vsurpe the Kingdome vnto him: but when <hi>Dauid</hi> heard of it, hee appointed <hi>Salomon</hi> to bee annoynted King forthwith; and so did praesently ouerthrow the vsurpation of the other. In which Story it is not amisse more specially to note, first that <hi>Adoniah</hi> from his youth was so tenderly affected by <note place="margin">Ibid. 6.</note> his Father, that he could neuer find in his heart to displease him; and therefore lesse maruell, that now he could thus requite him againe: then, that there is so diuers a placing of certaine persons in this action, as if it were according to their regard of them, which is most like, thence also may we gather some peece of instruction. For in <hi>Adoniahs</hi> vsurpation, and with <hi>Adoniah</hi> himselfe, <hi>Ioab</hi> hath the first place, before <note place="margin">Ibid. 7. <hi>Geneal. Christ. Tab.</hi> 6.</note>
               <hi>Abiathar</hi> who ioyned with him also, and was then, as it is noted, the High-Priest: and so it may become vsurpers well, to regard Captaines or Martiall men most; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> which also is for the most part practised by all politician worldlings besides. But in the end it had the successe according. One the other side, when <hi>Dauid</hi> would more orderly place <hi>Salomon</hi> in the Kingdome, he first placeth both <hi>Zadok</hi> the Priest, <note place="margin">Ibid. 32.</note> and <hi>Nathan</hi> the Prophet, before <hi>Benaiah</hi> then to be as in <hi>Ioabs</hi> roome: so placing them both before the Captaine; and betwixt these two also, <hi>Zadok,</hi> though but one of the ordinary Priests then, before <hi>Nathan</hi> a speciall Prophet. And though <hi>Benaiah</hi> was of so speciall reckoning, that the Text it selfe doth set him elsewhere, <note place="margin">Ibid. 8.</note> before the Prophet and others of speciall account: yet there also doth it place <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dok</hi> before him, though, <hi>Abiathar</hi> being the High Priest then, he could bee but of the second ranke of the Priests.</p>
            <p n="8">8 These troubles of <hi>Dauid</hi> being thus ouer-blowne, and God vouchsafing him a little calme wherein to close vp his life in the end, we are now to see the Story <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> of it. But whereas it is the most vsuall manner of History, first to lay downe the chiefe and principall matters thereof appertaining (and those according to the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Story, so neere as their owne iudgement doth serue them) and then to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member such others also, as might not so well come in before; seeing that heere we haue, in diuers thinges, the like order obserued, it shall be good the same be accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly followed: and so, first to consider of such thinges as we haue in this part of his Story, that belonged to a former time; then, of those that did appertaine to that present. Of those that belonged to a former time, some of them were such as
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:7530:174"/> did most concerne the whole estate: and some againe but particulars onely, at least in comparison of the others. Of those likewise that concerned the whole, some did most respect the Ciuill estate: others, the Ecclesiasticall rather. Those that did most respect the Ciuill estate, were some of them for times that were troublesome: others, for peaceable. For troublesome times hee had in a readinesse for euery month in the <note place="margin">1 Chr. 27: 1-15. 2. Sa. 23▪8-39.</note> yeare, a seuerall Army of soure and twenty thousand men: and Captaines or Leaders for them of special reckoning to such a purpose. Concerning whom, whereas they are specially named, &amp; the total sum of them so gathered in the end, that it is not so ready to be perceiued how the particulars and total agree, but that there be diuers opinions thereof, it seemeth to mee we may best take them, as already some of good reckoning <note place="margin">

Such as wee gather of certaine of them doe all concerne <hi>Dauid</hi> one way or other: most of them indeede, to his commendation; but one of them, to his iust reproofe.

In those that respected the Ecclesiasticall estate rather, we are first to consider of the maine parts of the things themselues: and then of one particular thereunto appertaining. The maine partes of the things themselues were that whereas now he vnderstood, that shortly a Temple should bee builded, and the <note place="margin">2. Sa. 7: 12, 13. 1. Chr. 22: 9, 10 Ibid. 5.</note> same in rare and sumptuous manner, and such as (for the beauty of it) should bee of speciall note to all the Countries round about: he did in like manner thinke it meete, that there should bee some such order taken for the Ministration or Seruice there to be done, as should be sutable to the excellencie of the place it selfe. For the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of it, God had taken order before, at the first erecting of the Tabernacle in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> the Wildernesse: but since that time one great part of the <hi>Leuites</hi> businesse became <note place="margin">1. Chr. 23: 26.</note> voyde, which was the carrying of the Tabernacle with them (too and fro as they had to iourney) and all the implements thereunto appertaining. For now they had rest, and did not trauell, but had a setled habitation: and so should the Temple bee fixed <note place="margin">2. Sam. 7: 10. 1. Chr. 23: 25.</note> too. So that the <hi>Leuites</hi> were now deliuered from all those burthens: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore might be otherwise imployed, as the most honourable, and the best dispatch of the Seruice of God should then require. <hi>Dauid</hi> therefore aduising himselfe of some conuenient order now, and conferring with the Prophets, <hi>Gad</hi> and <hi>Nathan</hi> therein, or those Prophets comminig vnto him with such direction from the Lord (for after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward it is plainely said, that the order now taken, was of the Lord, and by the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery <note place="margin">2. Chr. 29: 25.</note> of those two Prophets) gathering together the Princes of <hi>Israell,</hi> and the Priestes, he caused all the <hi>Leuites</hi> to be numbred from thirty yeare old and vp-ward: <note place="margin">1 Chr. 23: 2-5.</note> and finding the number of them to amount to thirte and eyght thousand, he appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted foure and twenty thousand of them, to the chiefe and principall seruice of the Temple that should be; and of the other foureteene thousand remaining, foure thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand of them hee appointed to adorne and helpe forward that Seruice by Musicke, both by voyce and Instruments too, and other foure thousand to be Porters and Kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, to see to the safty of them all, and of al things vnto the Temple belonging. And to the end that all these should performe their parts the better, euery one as his Lot should fall, or as otherwise hee should bee appointed, whereas yet there were of the whole summe sixe thousand remaining, those hee appointed to be ouer-seers, and to <note place="margin">Ibid. 4</note> iudge and determine such matters as shoulde fall out among them. Hauing thus made a generall distribution of all, then come they to the seuerall braunches: and first to those that were to bee occupyed in the Seruice within; then, to those others that were to keepe their watch abroad. Those that were to bee occupyed in the seruice within, were of two sorts: one company of them, as it were, about the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of their businesse; another, about the manner of doing. The substance of their businesse was, to make oblation and sacrifices, to burne Incense, and such like, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> as by the Law was before appointed: withall which, by the nature of them, and with <note place="margin">Ibid. 28, 29, 31, 32.</note> euery of them, there was to goe, eyther an acknowledging of their owne guilty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and Prayer thereon; or the remembrance of some fauour of God, and thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing withall. But at this time it seemeth, it was farther appointed, that euery Morning and Euening there should be some set Thankesgiuing and praising of the <note place="margin">Ibid. 30.</note> Lord, and for all his fauours and mercies towards them. The manner of dooing these thinges afore-said, was to ioyne Musicke withall. Vnto the former of these were the Priestes appointed; and the Singers vnto the other: but to eyther of them did appertaine other attendants; especially vnto the Priestes, who could neuer per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme their dutie but by the good help of those that did attend them, and often nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:7530:175"/> very many. First therefore, as touching the Priests, whereas there were found of <hi>Eleazar</hi> and <hi>Ithamar,</hi> those two Sonnes of <hi>Aaron</hi> that remained, sixteene Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies <note place="margin">Ibid. 4: 1-19.</note> of the former, and eyght of the latter, and so foure and twenty in all: now he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stributeth or diuideth them all into foure and twenty courses; and euery of them to take their place therein by Lot. So that, whereas they had twelue moneths in the yeare, and these were foure and twenty seuerall Families of the Priestes, none of them were eyther excluded from that dignity of seruing in the house of the Lord, or anything at all burthened with it: comming to their course but twice in the yeare if they tooke but a sennight at once, and but once, if they tooke a fortnight.

Then as touching the Singers, or those that had the charge to furnish out the Seruice with Instrument and voyce, as euer should be most seemely and meete, those also were diuided into foure and twenty courses or Families: a dozen of them, and their attendants, appertaining <note place="margin">Ibid. 25: 1▪31.

For albeit, that twelue of euery course bee onely noted, and yet they were foure thousand in all, seeing that twelue times foure and twenty make but two hundred eighty and eyght, needes must there be many attendants besides, vnto euery of these appertaining.

The other espyed before, that by that reckoning there was one too many: and therefore putteth two of them in one, without any likely-hood of warrant that I doe finde, eyther in the Originall it selfe, or in any other thereon. To shew therefore how the reckoning may better bee gathered by the Text it selfe, we are to note, that for the first seauen, the Sonnes of <hi>Meshlemiah</hi> (whom <hi>Sigonius,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> without any warrant also that I doe finde, calleth <hi>Selemia)</hi> and of the last foure, the Sonnes of <hi>Hosah,</hi> there is no quaestion: the Text it selfe keeping account of them. So that all the quaestion lyeth betwixt the next eyght, the Sonnes of <hi>Obed-Edom,</hi> and the sixe that follow immediatly after, the Sonnes of <hi>Shemaiah,</hi> the eldest Sonne of <hi>Obed-Edom:</hi> the eyght beeing numbred by the Text likewise; <note place="margin">1.

Now because the eyght are numbred, it is easily conceiued that they must all stand: and because the sixe are not, it seemeth that might be some part of the cause that <hi>Bertram</hi> made lesse conscience to put two of those in one. But if we looke well vnto it, we may soone perceiue, that <hi>Shemaiah</hi> is the Man (the eldest Son of <hi>Obed-Edom)</hi> that must in this reckoning be left out, all those his six Sons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken in. Neyther may that be any derogation to him, when the leauing out of his owne person is so richly recompenced in sixe of his Sonnes taken in, in his roome: no more than <hi>Ioseph</hi> himselfe was iniured, when himselfe is neuer accounted one of twelue (in the recitall of the Tribes) when his two sons <hi>Ephraim</hi> &amp; <hi>Manasses</hi> are taken in for him. So the seauen of <hi>Meshelemiah,</hi> the other seauen of <hi>Obed-Edom,</hi> the sixe of <hi>Shemaiah,</hi> and the foure of <hi>Hosah,</hi> as they do iustly make vp the number aforesaide: so are they the persons that by the warrant of the Text it selfe, and plaine demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> are meetest for it. That one particular heereunto appertaining, is, whereas <note place="margin">1. Chr. 23: 3.</note> first it is said, that <hi>Dauid</hi> to this end tooke the number of the <hi>Leuites</hi> from the age of thirty yeares &amp; vpward; and afterward twice, that he tooke them at the age of twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty <note place="margin">Ibid. 24, 27.</note>
               <pb n="330" facs="tcp:7530:176"/> and aboue: as it is plaine, that both these waies hee tooke account of them, and that he had some speciall cause to moue him thereto; so it seemeth to mee the reason is good that is conceiued thereof by <hi>Innius</hi> himselfe, far better then, than when hee ioyned with <hi>Tremellius</hi> therein. For he conceiueth, that the <hi>Leuites</hi> especially were Catechized or taught euen from their yongth such thinges as belonged vnto the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery: <note place="margin">In 1. Chr. 23: 26.</note> but yet, that all that while they were accounted, but at vnder age, or chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. But that from that time forward they were taken vnto the publique ministra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: yet for the next fiue yeares but onely to the contemplation or behoulding of it, at fiue and twenty to some inferior seruice vnder others, and not to take farther vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them till they were thirty.</p>
            <p n="9">9 Those that are but perticulars onely, at least in comparison of these more <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> generall matters going before, did some of them concerne in a manner, them all: and some againe did most respect <hi>Dauid</hi> himselfe. Those that concerned them all in a manner, are those battles that there are noted they had with the Giants: concerning which, seeing they are the last of this kind that we reade of, and wee haue set downe withall, that when God had deliuered him out of the handes of all his enemies, hee then gaue speciall thankes vnto God, it shall be good, when we haue considered of these battels; then to consider somewhat of that same his thanksgiuing also. As touching the battels, one there is, wherein <hi>Dauid</hi> himselfe was in person; but we doe not reade that hee was in the others. In that wherein himselfe was in person, hee <note place="margin">2. Sam. 21: 15-17</note> was also in great danger to haue beene slaine, by the Giant himselfe: but it pleased God to send him helpe by one of his Captaines, who stept in betwixt, and slue the Giant. Howbeit his people were so touched with that his danger, that then they tooke order, that himselfe should be no more in the field in his owne Person: as also it seemeth, that at that time his yeares were such, that according to the ordinary course of Souldiers he was to be priuileged by them. In the others, three other Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants were likewise slaine by <hi>Dauids</hi> men, in euery of them one, by a seuerall person: <note place="margin">2. Sam. 21: 18-22. 1. Chr. 20: 4-8:</note> two of which battels were fought neere vnto <hi>Gezer,</hi> in the Southwest side of the Tribe of <hi>Ephraim,</hi> not farre from the <hi>Philistims</hi> Land; and the other at <hi>Gath,</hi> in the land it selfe. As touching that thanksgiuing of his it is not onely notable in it selfe, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
               <note place="margin">2. Sa. 22: 1. 51.</note> ascribing, it wholy to God that he was preserued from all those dangers, and that his enemies were so brought vnder on euery side: but also, he did commit it to writing, to remaine of record, to Godes glory in him, and to the instruction and comfort of Gods people in the ages ensuing; God hauing giuen that successe vnto his godly care therein, that now we haue it in two seuerall places recorded, here first originally, then <note place="margin">Psal. 18: 1-50.</note> among his Psalms afterward also. Such as most respected <hi>Dauid</hi> himselfe, were either of such as belonged vnto him: or, of some good examples that himselfe did giue. Such as belonged vnto him, were of two sorts: some that did attend his priuate; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers <note place="margin">1. Chro. 27: 25-34.</note> that he had neerer vnto himselfe. Of those wherein himselfe gaue some good examples, one was in a thing done by himselfe: another in some thinges to be done by <hi>Salomon.</hi> That which was done by himselfe, was, that by the regard that hee heard to be in <hi>Rizpah</hi> the Concubine of <hi>Saul,</hi> towards two of her Sons, and others of the line of <hi>Saul,</hi> he also, prouoked thereby, and as it seemeth, loath to bee ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <note place="margin">2. Sam. 21: 10-14.</note> by any in gracious regard, did specially honour the memory of <hi>Saule</hi> and <hi>Iona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than:</hi> though but <hi>Ionathan</hi> onely were his friende, and <hi>Saule</hi> his Father his Mortall Enemy; not disdaining in any good to follow so base a person as she. In that other, which was in some things to be done by <hi>Salomon,</hi> we are first to see, on what ground that part of the Story is now to bee taken in heere: then, wherein it was, that <hi>Dauid</hi> gaue good example therein. The ground whereupon it is now to be taken heere, before that <hi>Salomon</hi> was yet appointed to be King, is this. <hi>Dauid,</hi> we see, doth moue <note place="margin">1. King. 2: 5, 6.</note>
               <hi>Salomon</hi> his sonne, to haue <hi>Ioab</hi> in mind and to cut him off.

               <hi>Adoniah,</hi> yet it seemeth heereby to haue beene before: neuerthelesse not denying but that for the freshnesse of it, it might bee, that it was not mentioned then; but rather making choise of the other, as the better ground to builde vppon. That wherein <hi>Dauid</hi> gaue good example heerein, rested in two principall pointes: one, towards God, another among men; but both of them mingled (as it seemeth) with the common infirmity of vs all. That which was commendable in him towardes <note place="margin">1.

That which may seeme to be of our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon infirmity that mingled therewith, was, that hauing spared <hi>Ioab</hi> all his time, he <note place="margin">Ibid. 5, 6.</note> would now haue his son to remember him. Wherein though it may be, that he had but the care to haue Iustice executed; yet it may be doubted withall, that he had some priuate respect therein. It may be he sought no more but to haue iustice done, because <hi>Ioab</hi> indeede had very wickedly committed wilfull murther twice <note place="margin">2 Sa. 3▪ 3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

For they were of two such persons, as were profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed and great enemies to <hi>Dauid</hi> a little before; albe it at that time <hi>Dauid</hi> him-selfe <note place="margin">2.

Of those that did appertaine to that prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, one there is, that yeeldeth in this place but part of the Story, and hath the other part following after the others are accomplished heere. That which yeeldeth but <note place="margin">1. King. 1: 1-4.</note> part of the Story heere, is that remedy that <hi>Dauid</hi> had, after that once he became so feeble: the rather to be marked, for that the more likelihood there is, that <hi>Dauid</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer had the vse of her body, being so weake as then he was, and the more certaine it is because the Text it selfe doth say it; the stronglier it teacheth in the end, how farre the Sonne should neuerthelesse reuerence his Fathers bed. Of those that are accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished heere, some things there were of speciall purpose before: others, that did but then come in with the time it selfe. Those that were of speciall purpose before, were most about the building of the Temple that should be: but partly, a prayer for <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi> Kingdome. About the building of the Temple that should be, first hee dealt but himselfe therein: then hee endeuoureth to lay that charge on others also. His owne dealing therein was, that when he had found (as we saw before) what place it was that the Lord had chosen, then he did set Masons on worke to make stones rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: <note place="margin">1. Chr. 22: 1-5.</note> and made much prouision besides. Hee endeuoureth to lay that charge on o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers also, two seuerall times, as it seemeth: first while <hi>Salomon</hi> yet was but a priuate man vnder his Father; then againe, after that he had made him King. While yet he was but a priuate man, his Father neuerthelesse knowing that he had to succeed him, he now dealeth both with himselfe, &amp; with the Princes of the people, about this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Himselfe he chargeth and exhorteth, to set in hand with it: both assuring him <note place="margin">1. Chr. 22: 6-16</note> that the Lord would prosper him therein; and letting him vnderstand what himselfe had already gotten in a readinesse for it: which was, besides Brasse and Iron, Timber and Stone, matters of lesse moment, much Marble, and a great number of precious stones of all sorts, and withall, euen an hundred thousand talents of Gold, and a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand thousand talents of Siluer: euery talent being about halfe an hundred with vs, <note place="margin">Ibid. 29: 2.</note> or threescore pounds weight. A rare example of the zeale of a Prince, towards the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> aduauncement of Gods glory, in so great a Masse as this, so faire a meane in the eye of the world, to haue aduaunced his owne line, to some speciall heigth.

That he did the like againe, after that <hi>Salomon</hi> was set in the Kingdome, because it is a thing some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what rare the Sonne to be ordained King in the dayes of his Father, therefore it shall be good, first to consider, how it came to passe, that in his Fathers daies hee came to be King, on whom that charge was chiefly to rest: then, how he layd that charge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them. That <hi>Salomon</hi> should succeede him in the Kingdome he knew before, <note place="margin">Ibid. 9, 10. &amp; 28: 4-7. 1. Kin. 1: 5▪ 40. 1. Chr. 23: 1.</note> and so he was minded to leaue it vnto him, as vnto whom God himselfe had it appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: but, by occasion that <hi>Adoniah</hi> was so forwarde, as to step vnto it in his Fathers daies (as we saw before) when hee thought his Father vnlike to recouer, or to stay long among them, to breake that packe, and in his owne daies to put it of question, he praesently ordained <hi>Salomon</hi> King, and caused him to bee set on the Throne of his Kingdome, his Nobles and people then comming in, and yeelding their allegeance <note place="margin">1. Chro. 29: 22-25.</note> vnto him. Hauing thus ordained him to bee King, then hee did set in hand in such sort with the matter againe, that it sorted to good effect in the end: and so are we first
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:7530:177"/> to consider, what it was that himselfe did now; then, how farre his desire was ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected therein. That which he did, was first to get those together that were mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test to such a purpose: and when he had gotten them together, then to deal accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly with them. Those that now he got together, as meetest to such a purpose <note place="margin">1. Chr. 28: 1, 9.</note>
               <hi>(Salomon</hi> his sonne, and newly made King, beeing with him already) were all the chiefe and principall men in all the land. His dealing with these, was first by gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions and louing speech: then, by such dooing of his owne besides, as serued vnto the businesse he had in hand. His speech was such, as directly tended to get them of minde to set in hand with the building of the Temple, and to finish the same in the best manner that they were able: but first to them all generally, and then to <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi>

In that which he did besides, as fitly seruing vnto the businesse he had in hand, we are not only to note what it was: but farther of some particulars thereto appertaining. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> It was no more but this, that first he gaue vnto <hi>Salomon</hi> the patterne of the house it <note place="margin">Ibid. 11-18.</note> selfe, and of all things thereunto appertaining, after what manner they should bee made; giuing him withall to vnderstand, that him-selfe had receiued the same in <note place="margin">Ibid. 19.</note> writing from the Lord, to the end that he might better conceiue the meaning of it, and that so he made him to conceiue it: then, to the end that those his Nobles, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, <note place="margin">Ibid. 29: 1-5</note> and principall men might yeelde to be more open-hearted in this businesse, and willingly giue some good contribution vnto it, himselfe doth giue them a good example therein, contributing of his owne priuate substance, 3000. talents of pure Golde, and 7000.

The particulars heereunto appertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, are two: one, appertaining vnto the patterne that he gaue vnto <hi>Salomon;</hi> the other vnto his owne contribution.

That which belongeth vnto his owne contribution, is, that hauing prouided so much before, and yet now giuing thus much besides, it occasioneth vs, first to consider, in what point these do varry: and, what our selues may gather on it. That these two contributions of his do some way varrie, there is no question, because they are so distinctly and seuerally set downe. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause this latter, of three thousand Talents of Gold, and seauen thousand of siluer, <note place="margin">1 Chr. 29▪ 3. 4 Ibid. 22: 14.</note> is tearmed so peculiarly his owne, when as notwithstanding it is saide of the other also, that he had prepared it, out of both these thus laide together, it seemeth, that the other great Masse of one hundered thousande Talents of Golde, one thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand thousand of Siluer, with all those precious stones of Brasse and Iron without number, was such as he (in his warres and spoile of the enemie, as also in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents were brought him, or such other like wayes besides) had from time to time laide by to that very vse: and that this latter was but of such as before hee tooke to his owne vse; but now thought good thus to bestow it. It being so, then dowe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> plainly see two things heerein: one, a rare and wonderfull zeale in him, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing prepared so much before, would neuerthelesse adde this also now; the other, that he aymed at a wonderfull sumptuous building, on the which he did set downe to bestow such abundance of Gold &amp; Siluer, besides such plenty of precious stones, and all things else that should go vnto it. An euident, and a notable checke vnto the prophane miserlings of our age, so greedily and so vncessantly spoyling the Church of God of those needfull things that others had giuen it before. His good desire was so well affected heerein, that then his Nobles and Officers both gaue plentifully: and that with great willingnesse also. Their liberality was such, that <note place="margin">Ibid. 29: 6-8.</note> they gaue (among them) fiue thousand Talents of gold, and 10000. peeces besides (this, belike in coine, and of the meaner sort of them; the other, in masse or <hi>Bullion)</hi> 10000. Talents of siluer, 18000. of brasse, and 100000. of Iron, and all the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:7530:178"/> stones they had besides. As touching their willingnesse heerein (a matter of great moment in al such cases) first it is plainly said: thē are there good tokens besides. In that it is so plainely said as it it, it might well be sufficient for vs: but that there be <note place="margin">Ibid 9-20.</note> other tokens also ensuing, may farther teach vs, that where there is true willingnesse indeede, it sheweth it selfe plainely enough, one way or other. Those tokens were one in <hi>Dauid:</hi> another in thēselues. That which was in <hi>Dauid,</hi> was, that he did great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reioyce to see it: and thereupon both gaue great thankes to God likewise, ioining <note place="margin">Ibid. 9, 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

But <hi>Dauid,</hi> being of a liberall heart himselfe, could neuer so greatly haue reioyced in that their contribution, vnlesse hee had seene, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede they had done very well therein: neyther could hee otherwise so heartily haue praised God, nor haue prayed for the continuance of it; nor by likelihood would so readily haue exhorted them to praise God for it. Neyther can we cleere our selues to those that are liberall and godly indeede, with any base or bastardly shew of such liberality in those cases, howsoeuer our selues may please our selues in it, and others withall of as miserable deuotion as wee. That which was in themselues, was, that they also in like manner reioyced, and besides their Peace-offeringes, wherewithall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/>
               <note place="margin">Ibid. 20▪ 22.</note> they feasted before the Lord with great ioy, the next day they offered Burnt-offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings in great aboundance (whereof there was no part to redound to themselues, but all to be consumed to the Lord) of young Bullocks, Rams, and other sheepe (Lambs belike) of euery of those three sorts, euen a thousand. Neyther can we soundly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce before the Lord, vntill wee truely find, that in the aduauncement of his glory among vs, wee do as it were (in our liberality) forget our selues, and vtterly detest and abandon all our worldly respects whatsoeuer. In the Prayen that we haue for <hi>Salomons</hi> Kingdome, considering that it is but one of the Psalmes, and that which is with vs (and according to the originall, the <hi>Hebrew</hi> it selfe) the threescore &amp; twelfth, <note place="margin">Psal. 72.</note> seldome or neuer taken by any to belong to this place: therefore it shall bee good, first to aduise ourselues, how we may conceiue it to belong to the place that now we are in; then, to consider of the thing it selfe.

For whereas some go no farther, but onely that it was made to <hi>Salomons</hi> vse (and not resoluing, that <hi>Dauid</hi> made it) others, that it was made by <hi>Salomon</hi> himselfe: the last verse of it, shewing that there the prayers (or Psalmes) of <hi>Dauid</hi> do end, doth giue a faire probability, first that this was made by <hi>Dauid;</hi> then also towardes the end of his life, when he had put <hi>Salomon</hi> in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome already. But besides that those two aforesaid do so take it, seeing the Psalme is for the good estate and long cotinuance of the raigne of King <hi>Salomon</hi> (especially as it was a figure of the Kingdome of Christ) if it were <hi>Dauid</hi> that made the same (as the end, I said, is a faire probable witnesse) euen the whole course of the Psalme it selfe doth sufficiently witnesse, that to this place it doth rightly belong. The thing it selfe is no more but this, that God hauing made choyce of <hi>Salomon</hi> to succeed him <note place="margin">1. Chr. 28. 4, 5. 2. Sa. 7: 12-16.</note> in the Kingdome, and hauing made so large promises to him, as that the accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them was to be expected in a greater than he, of whom hee was but onely a figure, <hi>Dauid</hi> also by occasion hauing set him in the Kingdome already: now hee specially commendeth him, and the estate of his Kingdome, to the good and graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <note place="margin">1. King. 1: 28-49. 1. Chr. 23: 1.</note> blessing of God; that, as it was of him, and of his meere and gracious goodnesse, so it might of him receiue stablishment, encrease, and all other good blessings meete <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> for the same. Therein both acknowledging the great mercies of God to him and his line: and notably raising vp the hearts of the faithfull to shew them what they may expect in Christ. But as he had that godly care of his posterity; so were it meete, that wee should learne to haue the like: and seeing hee did neuerthelesse by prayer seeke for the accomplishment of those things that were so firmly promised vnto him; much rather should we seeke for such things by prayer likewise, that we neede to the glory of God, and our eternall comfort in him, when we otherwise see not any such
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:7530:178"/> assurance of them. Those that came in with the time it selfe, are but two: the last wordes that is noted to haue vttered a little before his death; and, his death ensuing thereon. In the last wordes of <hi>Dauid,</hi> it shall not bee amisse if wee consider of them, first, as they did proceede from him: then, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> they may giue instruction to vs. As they did proceede from him, it seemeth to mee, that they were some-thing trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled by his infirmity and wearing away: as diuers times it is seene, euen with the <note place="margin">2. Sa. 23: 1-7▪</note> best men that are, towardes their deathes; and some-times euen in theyr age too when it is great. But needes must hee bee of an excellent Spirite, and of an heart very well exercised in godly meditation, and especially in the assurance of the speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all fauour of GOD towardes him and his, that could in such case vtter so many good speeches of those matters, though in diuers places some-thing broken, as I doe take it, and not so knit or tyed together, as otherwise hee was wont to doe. He was before a sore broken man, when in his bed hee was faine to bee couered <note place="margin">1. King. 1: 1.</note> by others: and wanting no Cloathes, yet could hee get no warmth thereby. But now beeing neerer to his dissolution, and so farre worne, that there was no hope but of small continuance (as wee may see by the vsurping of <hi>Adoniah,</hi> which was <note place="margin">Ibid. 5, 7, 9.</note> not without the aduice of <hi>Abiathar</hi> and <hi>Ioab</hi> principall men, nor in any dislike of many others neere vnto <hi>Dauid)</hi> seeing that a body loaden with infirmity, is oft-times such a Clogge to the mind, that it suffereth it not in diuers thinges so orderly to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede, as otherwise it could and would: lesse maruell it is, if some of these his spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, though good in themselues, neuerthelesse bee not so orderly and full as well might bee, in other case, of him expected. It may bee likewise, that this was not a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="L"/> continued speech, but rather consisting of many particulars, thus gathered together, but seuerally vttered by him, as his godly minde was occupyed in that Meditation: calling to minde, now one thing, nowe another: and sometime, it may bee, vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in word, but part of that which in heart hee conceiued. As they may giue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction to vs, thereby may we gather, how farre short wee are, of any good tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for those matters: when as, in our best estate, wee doe so hardly vtter any thing to any good purpose. So farre off are we, if our mindes should bee clogged with some speciall infirmity or paines of body (as it is certaine it was with <hi>Iob,</hi> and not vnlikely in some sort now to bee so with <hi>Dauid</hi> also) yet neuerthelesse to haue none other but so good Meditations and speaches as these. But some vessell of Wine there is, that keepeth his Verdure, and drinketh better, euen to the Leese, than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers doe, when they are at the best. His death that ensued or followed thereon, <note place="margin">2. Sa. 5: 4, 5. 1. King. 10, 11.</note> was at the age of seauenty yeares, when himselfe had raigned forty in all. A very good patterne, as lighly we haue any where else, both of the great corruption that is in vs; and what good thinges may be lodged withall in the selfe-same breast, by the goodnesse and grace of God: and so likewise, that God doth not for euer cast off those that are his, though they doe very iustly deserue it; and yet (oft-times) that he doth not suffer their lesser offences to go vnpunished.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Alomon</hi> was the next of those vnder whom the people continued <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> together vnder one Kingdome and State: immediatly after diuiding themselues (though abiding one people still) yet into two seuerall Kingdomes. Being therefore now to consider of <hi>Salomons</hi> Story, in him doe we finde iust cause to consider, not onely of his life: but also of his death. As touching his life, in it doe wee finde great variety betwixt the former, and the latter part of his raigne: the former part of it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing such, as, in figure, might well resemble the glory and excellency of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:7530:179"/> of Christ; but the latter of it, so odding againe the contrary way, that well may it teach vs, to looke for no perfection heere. It might well in figure resemble the glory and excellency of the Kingdome of Christ, because it was for that time, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> (especially when it was come vnto the grouth that GOD would giue it; yea, and in the time of encreasing too, so farre as was needefull for it) a comfortable estate vnto the people, and uery gloryous at home and abroad. In so much, that imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dialy after his first enterance into his Kingdome, it is sayde, that the Lord was with <note place="margin">1. King. 2: 12. 2. Chr. 1: 1.</note> him and magnyfied him, and that his Kingdome was mightily established. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthelesse, as in reason wee may conceiue, that it had a beginning and time to grow to a setled estate: so the course of the Story dooth likewise lead vs, first, to such thinges as did appertaine vnto the beginning of it: then, vnto others that belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vnto it, when it was come to a setled Estate. Those thinges that did apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine vnto the beginning of it, before it grewe to a setled Estate, were certaine ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill affaires of his owne: and then a religious seeking of GOD. Those ciuill affaires of his owne, were, first the cleering of himselfe of certaine ill members: then, how hee disposed himselfe to marriage. Of those ill members, one of them was very dangerous vnto his Tytle and Estate in the Kingdome: the residue, though they were great offenders too, yet not in so high a degree as the other, in respect of the State it selfe. Hee that was so daungerous vnto his Tytle or Estate in the Kingdome, was <hi>Adoniah</hi> his elder Brother: who would haue stepped (as wee saw before) betwixt <hi>Salomon</hi> and the Kingdome, in the dayes of <hi>Dauid</hi> his Father. But <note place="margin">1 King. 1: 5-9.</note> when hee vnderstood that <hi>Salomon</hi> was by <hi>Dauid</hi> appointed and proclaymed, hee then submitted himselfe, and craued pardon: which also hee obtained vppon condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <note place="margin">Ibid. 50-53.</note> that he should after become of good and dutifull alleagiance. Neuerthelesse, beeing now a while after taken away in such sort as hee was, wee are the rather to consider on it, both for the Story it selfe: and for another thing thereof arising. In the Story it selfe, wee are first to consider of his offence: then, of the punnishment of it. In his offence likewise, first what it was: then, howe it came to <hi>Salomons</hi> knowledge. His offence was, some part of it, open and plaine: but some other, that lay more secret. That which was open and plain, was such an impotency in flesh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">Ibid. 2: 17.</note> desire, that hee was not ashamed to seeke to defile his Fathers Bed; desiring <hi>Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sag</hi> a Concubine of his, to bee in marryage giuen vnto him. True it is, that <hi>Dauid</hi> had not her, till it may bee probably thought, that hee was not of ability to haue <note place="margin">Ibid. 1: 1▪4.</note> carnall Copulation with her: but yet not to bee denyed withall, but that hee had her <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> company day and night, and that they were together as Man and Wife, sauing one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the Act it selfe of carnall knowledge. That which lay more secret, was, as it seemeth, that thereby hee thought to get him a step to the Kingdome, as vouchsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed one of his Fathers Wiues; beeing, as hee was, the elder Brother besides: yet so much the greater fault in him, if that were his meaning, for that hee did know, that the Lorde himselfe had appointed <hi>Salomon</hi> to succeede his Father in the Kingdome. <note place="margin">Ibid. 2: 15.</note> How this desire of his came to <hi>Salomons</hi> knowledge, is so much the more woorthy the marking, for that it seemeth to carry with it a very iust iudgement of God: that whereas he had not the honesty, nor that Childe-like reuerence vnto his Father, as to suppresse so beastly a motion; so neyther should hee haue the wit to conceale it, but himselfe must make it knowne to the King. For hee commeth to <hi>Bethsabe</hi> the Kinges Mother, and entreateth her to mooue the King in it: which also shee did, <note place="margin">Ibid. 13-18. Ibid 19-21. Ibid. 22-25.</note> and her-selfe besought the King to graunt it. In his punnishment, wee haue first set downe the Kinges determination of it: then, the execution soone after ensuing. Whereof, as in the one wee may see a quicknesse and readinesse in <hi>Salomon</hi> to espy, that his elder Brother was yet aspyring: so in the other wee may likewise see, that his wisedome thought good, to take the aduantage of his former offence (though hee were his Brother) euen for this doubt of aspyring that nowe brake foorth of him; albeit it was not certaine that thence it proceeded, and it may bee it was but the loue <note place="margin">Ibid. 1: 4.</note> he had to the party, being so beautifull as she was. That other thing heereof ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, is, that whereas in the dayes of our late ignorance, this speech of <hi>Salomon: Aske on my Mother, for I will not say thee nay,</hi> was applyed (or wrested rather) as to <note place="margin">Ibid. 2: 20.</note>
               <pb n="337" facs="tcp:7530:179"/> be spoken by Christ to his Mother; so to beare people in hand, that the blessed Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine could readily attaine for vs at the handes of Christ whatsoeuer she would: here may wee see so hard a successe of that course taken, that in reason it should rather terrrify others from it, than allure any vnto it. For though <hi>Salomon</hi> did great reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence vnto his Mother, arising out of his Throne, meeting her by the way, bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himselfe vnto her, and causing her to sit downe on the right hand of him; and told her withall, when hee perceiued that shee had a suite vnto him, that hee would not say vnto her nay: yet when hee conceiued, that that request was but so farre de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatory to his Crowne and Dignity (and yet not certaine, but onely as himselfe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> suspected: whereas that seeking to the blessed Virgine that was vsed by vs, and yet is by diuers of vs, was vndoubtedly derogatory to the Crowne and Dignitiy of Christ) hee quickly tooke in his word againe, and made the onely moouing of that matter vnto him, to cost the party himselfe his life, that first did mooue it. Of the residue that were great offenders too, yet not in so high a degree as this other was conceiued to be, whereas there were three of them in all, one there was whom the King did otherwise punish: but he did put the two others to death. That one whom he did otherwise punnish, was <hi>Abiathar</hi> (the High-Priest, it seemeth, at that time:) <note place="margin">

His fault was, that hee was with <hi>Adoniah</hi> in his vsurpation: whereby it may seeme, that eyther it was not then so well knowne, that <hi>Salomon</hi> was to succeede; or else that his fault was so much the grearer, both to doe it in the dayes of him that then was, and against him that was to succeede. In his punnishment wee are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider what it was: and what farther cause there was, why it was inflicted on him. His punnishment was, that hee and his Line were remooued from the Priest-hood; <note place="margin">Ibid. 2: 26, 27.</note> and himselfe appointed to keepe his House: beeing then also giuen to vnderstand, that hee had deserued death, but that he was spared therein, for the seruice hee did to <hi>Dauid</hi> before. That farther cause why it was inflicted on him, was the sinne <note place="margin">1. Sa 2▪ 2-36. Ge. Chr. Ge. 6</note> of <hi>Ely</hi> before (the fourth aboue him, or great Graund-Father vnto his Father) as then it was denounced vnto him, for suffering his Sonnes to growe so loose as they did: according as <hi>Ahimelek</hi> his Father, and many others of that Race with him, (as wee saw before) had a sharpe scourge for that matter also. Those two others <note place="margin">Pag.</note> that hee put to death, were <hi>Ioab,</hi> and <hi>Shimey: Ioab</hi> at this praesent, when hee displa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced <hi>Abiathar</hi> (vppon this motion of <hi>Adoniah,</hi> hauing spared them hitherto, it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth;) <note place="margin">1. King. 2: 22, 26, 28.</note> but <hi>Shemey</hi> not till three yeares after. But seeing hee also had his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment nowe, though his execution were not yet, therefore it shall bee very good now to dispatch the one with the other while wee haue it in hand. As touching <hi>Ioab,</hi> when hee heard that <hi>Adoniah</hi> was executed, and <hi>Abiathar</hi> put from his Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, <note place="margin">Ibid. 28-34.</note> he suspecting that which was towardes him indeede, would haue saued him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe or put off his death for a time, by taking Sanctuary (as we tearme it:) but it would not auaile him now, when hee before had so fouly cast at his heeles the feare <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> and reuerence of that GOD, by whose Altar hee would haue beene spared. As <note place="margin">Ibid. 36-46.</note> for <hi>Shimey,</hi> the King sent for him, and charged him to keepe in Hierusalem: gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing him to vnderstand withall, that hee should dye for it, if euer hee stepped out thence. At which time hee liked it well, as glad that the King had giuen him that sparing, and as it seemeth tooke his Oath to obserue the same: but his owne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iquity before, and <hi>Salomons</hi> resolutenesse now, not to pardon that aduantage vnto him, would not suffer him long to enioy it. And so shortly after, comming in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, at least of the latter of that his restraint, the aduantage was taken, and hee executed: but whether, onely to take away a badde man by such opportunity as may bee obtained (as indeede a crooked cast, needeth oft-times a crooked mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure) or that some straine of reuenge was mingled withall (for there is no quaestion, but men are men) though it be the parts of all to thinke the best, yet may there be no hurt to leaue it vnto the freedome of euery mans iudgement therein. Hauing thus cleered himselfe of these bad members, the next that wee read of, is, how hee disposeth himselfe to marriage: but as in the Text it is tearmed making of affiny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with <hi>Pharaoh</hi> King of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> by taking his Daughter to Wife, and seeing <note place="margin">1. King. 3: 1.</note>
               <pb n="338" facs="tcp:7530:180"/> after we finde, he had many Wiues and Concubines besides, it seemeth to me, that <note place="margin">bid. 11: 3.</note> this also was more for affinities sake, than onely or chiefly for marriage it selfe. For it appeareth he was married already, about two yeares before the death of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, his Sonne <hi>Rehoboam</hi> that did succeede him, being one and fourty yeares old <note place="margin">Ibid. 14. 21.</note> when hee came to the Kingdome, and so about a yeare old when <hi>Salomon</hi> himselfe began his raigne, which was the space of fourty yeares. Being therefore married so lately before, and making no conscience to take so many Wiues and Concubines, it may well seeme, that many of them, and this for one, were but to make affinity with the Princes and Nobles about him: plurality of being of no more censcience with many then, than plurality of benefices in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> since, or plurali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Lordships, Offices, Farmes, or other liuings (not of the guift of God, but by their owne busie and guilty industry, and though others want neuer so much) with the children of the world now; and to Princes and great men, not the least part of their pomp or magnificent ostentation in the eyes of others. But now concerning <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> this and such like affinity of his (for though wee haue no mo so specially noted, yet haue we good probability of many) it shall be good to note something as touching himselfe: and something againe as touching others. As touching himselfe, it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to me he did much offend therein: and yet I am not ignorant, but that others there bee, that are better perswaded of him for this matter. It seemeth to mee he much offended, first in matching with the Heathenish people: then, in that he mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched with many. In that he matched with those that were Heathenish, he had not that care, eyther of himselfe or of his posterity (so farre as it seemeth) that he ought to haue. That himselfe might bee corrupted by them, the common weaknesse of vs al doth witnesse, by oft &amp; pittifull experience: and was verified in himselfe short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after. His posterity must needes be endangered likewise, not onely by that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon infirmity in them as well as in others, but so much the more, for that they were like to be ouer-weighed so ill by the surer side whereof they came: and yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing was the case such with him, that in many respectes he ought to haue had a singular care thereof.

As he was but one of the people, he had the first institution of marriage against him; and the Law afterward giuen: of neyther of which he might be ignorant, but with breach of his duty therein, for that euery King of that people was charged diligently to study that Booke of God. In the first institution of marriage he could not but see, <note place="margin">Deut. 17: 18-20. Gen. 2: 22. Ibid 4 19.</note> that God made but one for one: and that the corruption of that institution for this point, was first found in the line of accursed <hi>Kain.</hi> In the Lawe, it had beene an easie matter for him to haue found, by the propriety of his own mother tongue (the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> want whereof hath made many great men since vnable to find it) that a man hauing <note place="margin">Leuit. 18: 18</note> a Wife already, might not take another vnto her duting her life; and though there were no other cause, yet euen for the vexation onely that such dealing might breed to the former: especially, that other vnderstanding of it (of naturall Sisters) being <note place="margin">Ibid. 16.</note> sufficiently, by the like, decided a little before. As hee was now in the Throne of the Kingdome, hee might find himselfe, euen as it were by name, forbiden to haue any mo but one: and a good reason thereunto annexed. That others are better perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <note place="margin">Deut. 17: 17</note> of him for this his doing, is a matter sufficiently known: my selfe finding none of other opinion; and some that professe the defense of him in it. But the chiefe and principall reasons they vse, mee thinke are to weake to such a purpose: one, that <note place="margin">Lyr. Conr. Pel Pet, Martyr. Tremel. Iun.</note> she was conuerted first to the <hi>Iewes</hi> profession; the other, that as yet hee loued the Lord. As touching the former, first they haue no warrant thereof, that so it was:
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:7530:180"/> then, that also would not serue, though so shee were, <hi>Naamah</hi> his former Wife yet remaining, as there is no knowledge yet of her death, nor sufficient cause to suspect <note place="margin">1. King. 14: 21, 31.</note> it, beeing marryed so late as they were. As touching the latter of them, that yet he loued the Lord, and walked in the ordinances of <hi>Dauid</hi> his Father, so might hee doe, at least in some measure, and yet bee wanting in this point of duty, as also his Father was before, and yet other-wise hath good Testimony towardes God like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise. <note place="margin">2. Sam. 2: 2. 3: 2-5. Psal. 45.</note> As touching others, there is one of the Psalmes which goeth vnder the Name of <hi>Dauid</hi> together with the rest, though for some of them wee doe not know who were the Inditers of them, and diuers of them do beare (in their beginning) the Names of others that made them: but it is of that argument, that well it might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <hi>Dauid</hi> himselfe to haue indited it, and to haue vsed it to this very purpose. For in his time it was, that <hi>Salomon</hi> his Sonne marryed with <hi>Naamah</hi> afore-said: and she <note place="margin">1. King. 14: 21. 31.</note> beeing an <hi>Ammonite,</hi> of an Heathen and an Idolatrous Race likewise, there was good cause why <hi>Dauid</hi> should exhort her to forget her owne people, and her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers house, when now she was to be <hi>Salomons</hi> Wife: and praesupposing that she was <note place="margin">Psal. 45: 10.</note> Daughter to the King of the <hi>Ammonites</hi> (as was most likely) the residue of the Psalme would very fitly agree to her also. But if it were indited but about this his marriage with the King of <hi>Aegypts</hi> Daughter, as a figure of the Espousals be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> Christ and his Church (as it is the most common iudgement of all) it is then out <note place="margin">Conr. Pellic. Fran. Vatab Tremel. Iun. Bibl. Angl.</note> of quaestion, that it was after <hi>Dauids</hi> time: and it may seeme, that some of the godly noting him to haue marryed with an Heathen Princesse before, and now to bee in hand with the like againe, doubting whereunto such marriages might growe in the ende, and yet conceiuing how well they might figure that other Mystery betweene theyr Messiah and his chosen people, did to their vse for that praesent, and in that praesent case of theirs, indite that Psalme, and to the vse and benefite of the Church that then was, or at any time should afterward be. Which if so it were, is a token sufficient, that some there were in those daies also that did not like it, but rather stood in some speciall feare of it. But now, that some there bee of speciall reckoning, who are of opinion, that seeing hee did marry her, therefore it is not to be doubted, <note place="margin">Tremel. Iun.</note> but that first she yeelded to their profession, because that yet hee loued the Lord, affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, that otherwise he might not haue doone it, by the vertue of that prohibition which wee haue in the seauenth of <hi>Douteromy:</hi> I cannot see, but that they are very <note place="margin">Deut 7: 3.</note> wide therein, because that prohibition is not of all Heathen folke generally but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of those seauen Nations that inhabited the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> being there set down <note place="margin">Ibid. 1-3.</note> namely on them; the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> being sufficiently knowne to bee none of that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, but of another Countrey and Nation. And else-where it is plaine, that GOD permitteth them to marry with Women of other Nations, onely after some Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall <note place="margin">Deut. 21: 10-13.</note> purging; and doth not enioyne them to tarry till they be instructed in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, and till they yeeld to that profession: leauing them rather, it seemeth, to win them in time, by sound instruction and kinde vsage ioyned together; than forbidding them till then to take them. And yet it is certaine, that there were no Nations about them, but such as were Heathenish and Idolatrous too. Whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the very Psalme it selfe seemeth to beare sufficient witnesse, in the witnesse, in the <note place="margin">Psal. 45: 10-16</note> case that now we are in, for that, so effectually calling vpon her, to forget her owne people and Fathers house, it seemeth to teach vs, that as then she had not done it. In that his religious seeking to God, we are to note, what it was done by him: and how <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> God accepted of it. That which was done by him, was, that he gathered together all the Princes, Captaines, and Gouernours of the people, euen all the chiefe of the Land, and went to to <hi>Gibeon</hi> where the Tabernacle was, to worship, and did offer a <note place="margin">1. King. 3: 4. 2 Chr. 1. 1-6.</note> thousand Burnt-offeringes on the Brazen Altar there. It pleased God so to accept thereof, that in a dreame that night hee appeared vnto him, and offered vnto him a <note place="margin">1. King. 3: 5. 2. Chr. 1: 7.</note> very special and a singular fauor: namely to aske, whatsoeuer it was he most desired, to the end he might giue it vnto him. Whereupon <hi>Salomon</hi> made his choyce so, that therein againe he pleased the Lord maruellous well: and so it shall bee good for vs more specially to marke, what it was that <hi>Salomon</hi> craued; and how far the Lord did like on him therein. That which he craued, was, that whereas God, according to
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:7530:181"/> his promise to <hi>Dauid</hi> his Father, had now placed him in the kingdome; and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple <note place="margin">1. King. 3▪6-9. 2. Chr. 1: 8-10</note> thereunto appertaining, were so many, that to gouerne them aright hee had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing neere that furniture of wisedome and knowledge that would bee needfull: it would please him to giue him an vnderstanding heart, or the guift of wisedome and knowledge, whereby he might rightly determine of all such causes as to the gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that his people should appertaine. Wherein it shall bee good for vs to marke, what kinde of wisedome it was, that, it seemeth, hee did desire: then, how it came to passe hee desired the same. As touching the former, it seemeth it was but such wisedome and vnderstanding, as may stand cleare of the knowledge and feare of God, and of the sincerity or truth in Religion: and but such as the Children of the World, and Heathnish Polititians oft-times haue. For neyther can there neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily bee any more gathered of the wordes themselues: and seeing afterward it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, that God gaue him (in plentiful measure) that which he asked, his great and strange fall that followed may sufficiently shew, that it was no more that he desired; it may bee, as making no doubt (for the opinion, that wee haue such power in our selues, doth naturally grow in the hearts of vs all) but that hee could well enough order himselfe for that matter. How it came to passe, that hee made his choyce of wisedome, is so much the rather to bee considered, for that it seemeth to carry the cause with it: &amp; yet is not so noted by others. For the cause seemeth to be, that he was wise-hearted already; and thereuppon most desired wisedome: common experience <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> euer teaching, that the wiser that any haue beene, the more haue they desired to haue more wisedome; and the more they haue beene lapt vp in the swatheling-clouts of follie, the lesse haue they made any reckoning of it. And as <hi>Dauid</hi> his Father commending vnto him the causes of <hi>Ioab</hi> and <hi>Shimey,</hi> before made reckoning of spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall <note place="margin">1 King. 2. 6, 9.</note> wisedome in him: so himselfe also, in taking them away so as he did, did suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently verify that opinion of <hi>Dauid</hi> of him. Yet notwithstanding it goeth for cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant with all the Children of the World, that they are none of the wisest, that most of all couet the best and purest wisedome that is: and yet (of their courtesie) they will not deny them, but that they may be honest and plaine, simple and well-meaning men; but yet still withall, none of the wisest. Whereas notwithstanding, the true and best wisedome of all, is neuer desired but onely of such as are wise-hearted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede: all <hi>Aesops</hi> Cockes ioying more in a Barley Corne, than in the most Orient precious stone that can be conceiued. How farre the Lord did like on him herein, may soone be conceiued, by al things in a manner that afterward ensued, concerning him &amp; his estate, during the time that he aboad in the feare of God. But because most of those doe concerne the maine part of the Story, therefore is it meetest, that for this matter we rest on those thinges onely, that do immediately follow heereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and most properly belong to the place that now we are in: first, the comfortable wordes that God thereuppon did giue vnto him; then, a praesent experiment, howe effectually he obtained that which he desired. The wordes that thereuppon God did giue him, were so comfortable vnto him, that hauing done at <hi>Gibeon,</hi> and retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to Hierusalem, there he did the much like also. For at this time the Lorde did affure him absolutely, not onely of that which he asked, in very liberall and plentiful <note place="margin">1. King. 3: 10-14. 2. Chr. 1▪ 11, 12: 1. King. 3: 15</note> measure; but of riches and honour besides in great abundance; and on condition that he would diligently walke in his wayes, then of farther fauour besides. Retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to Hierusalem, there hee worshipped againe before the Arke, first offering Burnt-offeringes there againe, and Peace-offeringes besides: then also, feasting all <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="L"/> his Seruants. That praesent experiment, which sheweth how effectually hee obtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that which he desired, was in the cause of those two Women that stroue so bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily <note place="margin">Ibid. 16-28.</note> about the dead and the liuing Childe: hee readily finding out by his wisedome, without any witnesses, the true Mother, both of the dead Child which they both re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused, and of the liuing, which both of them challenged, onely by that naturall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection that Parents doe commonly beare vnto their Children. In both which Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of his wee may doe well to marke, in the former of them, how much wee also might please God and benefite ourselues at his hands, if we should aboue all world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thinges heere couet to doe him the best seruice we could, euery one in our seuerall
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:7530:181"/> callings: and in the latter, how vndoubtedly we were like to bee discarded from the number of true Fathers and Mothers, to those that are vnder our charge, if our <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> Iesus Christ should make tryall of vs, by our hearty affection towards them.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Those thinges that belonged vnto it when it grew to a setled estate, were <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> many and diuers: and yet none other in effect, but such as shewed, to what power and glory it pleased God to bring that Kingdome or State of his vnto. And the power and glory whereunto it pleased God to bring it, was by his religious regard of God, wherein for a time he was very commendable: and so are wee first to see, what was that religious regard of his towardes God; then, to consider withall, what was the glory wherwith it pleased God to cloth him. That religious regard of his towards God we most of all find, in that chiefe and principall work that he had to do, and did most properly belong vnto him: then also, in som others besides, which were common to him and others. That chiefe and principal work that he had to do, &amp; did most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly belong vnto him, was about the Temple that he had to build or set vp vnto the Lord: &amp; first to dispatch the workmanship of it; then, to consecrate or to giue vp the same to his vse, by whose appointment, and to whose vse, he had ordained it. That the worke-manship of it might be the better dispatched, it was needfull there were some good fore-casting before; and so we finde there was: first praeparing things meet for the purpose; then, setting in hand with the businesse it selfe. That there was such prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> before, we haue first some likelihood of it: then also, good testimony, that so it was. The likelihood we haue, is, that it was in the minde of <hi>Salomon,</hi> or that <note place="margin">2. Chr. 2: 1.</note> he determined to build an House vnto the Lord. For wise-men, or that are of any fore-cast, when once they are determined of speciall businesse, then doe they also prouide accordingly. The Testimony we haue that so it was, doth not onely shew, what it is was doone: but withall, howe effectuall it was besides. That which was done, was partly abroad: and partly at home. Abroad he laide a tribute on all ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally, that were subiect to his Dominions: and more specially dealt with <hi>Hiram</hi> King of <hi>Tyre,</hi> for his helpe in this businesse. The tribute hee raised, was not onely for the House of the Lord, but for diuers other works besides, which he had in mind <note place="margin">1.

Heereupon it seemeth, <hi>Salomon</hi> nowe dealt more effectually with him, for his helpe in the matter. Certaine it is, that hee craued his helpe, both for Timber; and some speciall woorke-men besides. The Timber he desired, was of the Caedars of <hi>Libanus,</hi> the largest and fayrest Timber in all those <note place="margin">Ibid. 2-11. 2.

When we are to see how they did set in hand with the worke it selfe for which all this prouision was, wee are to know, that whereas God would now haue a Temple or fixed place of worship rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto him, there must needs be many other things thereunto appertaining: and so are we first to consider of the place it selfe, where he would be worshipped; then of the things that belonged vnto it. The place that God would haue to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, is for the most part called the Temple: but then vnder it wee are to consider both of the House that was then to be reared, and of the Courts thereunto apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining. As touching which House and Courts, thereunto appertaining, wee first haue certaine circumstances going before: then in what manner the same was builded. The circumstances are two: one of the place; another of the time. The place where it was to be set, and where accordingly they first laide the foundation and building thereon, was a part of <hi>Ierusalim</hi> which of olde was of the boundes of <note place="margin">2.

For the manner of the building of it, wee are first to consider of some difficulties that are therein: then, what may seeme to haue beene the manner of it. The difficulties that are therein, are all about the house it selfe, and do all arise out of the variety of mens iudgements thereon: some about the measure of the whole; but most about the manner of building the seuerall parts.

That which is gathred as vpon the Text it selfe, resteth on two principal places, both where these things are repeated againe: one, where it is saide, that <hi>Salomon</hi> began to lay the foundation according <note place="margin">2.

Howbeit, both the sence of this place may be otherwise: and there is another soone after ensuing, that cannot wel brook this interpretation. The fence of this place may bee, that both these houses were cast together in laying out the foundation of them, threescore cubits in length, and twenty in bredth, being lined or laid foorth on the earth for them both, on the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side whereof they had to open the earth▪ so farre as the thicknesse of the wall, and

That other ensuing, which could not well brook the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saide interpretation, is the measure of the Brazen Altar, noted to be ten cubites in height: ouer great a measure by far, for the vse whereunto it was ordained, if the cubit should be double, as they conceiued in the other. In that of the pillers their reasoning is, that there speaking but of the ordinary measure, and but of the length of one of them onely, it doth fitly agree with the other relation before, if so it bee taken, but otherwise varieth much: the one of those places setting down the height <note place="margin">2. King. 7: 15. 2. Chr. 3: 15.</note> of those two pillers to be but eighteene cubits; and the other, thirty and fiue. For one cubit they conceiue to be hid in the base or foot of the piller beneath. Which one being added vnto the other 35. making 36. should be the iust measure of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther eighteen; they being taken for double cubits, &amp; these for single. But in this also not onely others are of other opinion, namely, that the measure in both places <note place="margin">Conr. Pel. Fra. Vatab. Bibl. Angl.</note> is one, and that the oddes is no more but this, that in the former the length of one is noted by it selfe, and in the latter the length of both (so much as was seene without their bases beneath) was ioyned together: but also, taking the measure in both pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to be one, if but one of them should be fiue and thirty Cubits high, and the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple it selfe but thirty (as wee haue that measure set downe for it) that were not so <note place="margin">1. King. 6: 2. <hi>Tremel. Iun. in</hi> 1▪ King. 7: 2.</note> meete a proportion for it. That reason of theirs which resteth on probability one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, is, that otherwise the house that he built in <hi>Libanus,</hi> should bee greater than this House of the Lord; it being an hundred Cubits long; &amp; this but threescore: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as if these be accounted double, and the other but single, then would these sunnount the other by twenty; no great matter to answere the oddes that in proportion was betwixt the owners of them, God the Lord, and <hi>Salomon</hi> his Seruaunt. Againe, though so it might gaine the aduantage in length; yet could in not (by that meanes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> neyther) reach it in breadth: the breadth of the Temple being but twenty Cubites; <note place="margin">1. King. 6: 2.</note> and so not able to make but fourty in all, though they were doubled; whereas the breadth of the other was fifty. But that house in the Fortest of <hi>Libanus</hi> was an house <note place="margin">1. King. 7: 2.</note> of pleasure, for <hi>Salomon</hi> to recreate himselfe in, when hee was disposed: who being a magnificent Prince, and hauing many attendants and great affaires, had need more roome (euen at the streightest) than the Lord should neede to haue in his house, for one Priest onely, or at any time but very few, to doe that little seruice that there hee required. And so is that reason of no great force to this purpose. About the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of building, the difficulties are, both about the house it selfe, and about the Porch. For the house it selfe, it is thought by many (and I wonder by what warrant) that this whole building of threescore Cubits in length, and twenty in breadth, was an hundred and twentie in height. For so doth <hi>Lyra</hi> set it downe, and according to the <note place="margin">On 1 King. 6. in the letters c, d. and e. 1594 on 2. Chr 3: 4. d. 2. Chro. 3: 4. <hi>Cour. Pellic.</hi> in 1.

Which heigth of an hundred and twenty Cubites when they haue giuen vnto it, then, without any coulour of warrent that I can find the Text to yeeld them, doe they make two heights or losts aboue the nethermost roomes, one aboue another, and of the selfe same length and breadth: giuing those thirty Cubites that are spoken of for the heigth, onely vnto the lowest roomes; and the like quantity of heigth againe to the next, and double as much to the heighest of those lofts that they conceiue to haue beene aboue. A thing that may probably seeme to be very vnlikely (and so is it taken by others) that any such roomes should bee aboue a place of that reckoning, as should occasion any to bee <note place="margin">Conr.

                  <hi>Conr. Pellic. in</hi> 1. <hi>Reg.</hi> 6: 3.</note> aboue, vnlesse it were one way or other taken off from it, as they do conceiue by those two Lofts; but then we see not, how they can be there by any good warrant. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it altogether to be neglected, that whereas it should be a figure of Christ, and of his Church (at least of the truer members thereof) it should outwardly bee but of reasonable reckoning, both for the quantity and fairnesse of it; and yet of rare and wonderfull beauty within: as also, that the beauty or glory it had within, should not be communicable but onely to the eyes of few; others beeing left to their choyce, whether they would beleeue it or not, when as see it they should not. As touching the Porch, though we reade but of two thinges onely therein, which were those two faire and speciall Pillars: yet therein also haue wee some difficulty, both as touching the Porch it selfe; and the Pillars that were therein. In the Porch it selfe no more but this, that it is not (that I find) described by any; but onely for the length and breadth, rhe heigth being altogether omitted: and not onely by those that giue so great heigth vnto the Temple; but also by those that dare not bee so liberall therein, as are the others. Of those that giue so great heigth vnto the Temple, it is the lesse to be expected, not onely for hauing giuen so much to the one, they may well haue the lesse to giue to another: but much rather, for that if they should make it of one heigth with the other, both they were without warrant (but onely for it selfe) and could not finde any vse for it, hauing attributed that to their Lofts before. But as for those that conceiue not the Temple it selfe to be but thirty cubits high, they might haue found so good vse of the heigth of the Porch, that it is more strange that they also omit it. For <hi>Vatablus</hi> hath a faire description of the Temple and Chambers <note place="margin">On 1. K. 6.</note> thereunto appertaining, and giueth but thirty Cubites heigth vnto the Temple: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> but altogether omitteth the heigth of the Porch. Diuers of our <hi>English</hi> Bibles like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise (especially those that were set foorth by such of the learned of our owne Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, as were at <hi>Geneua</hi> in the daies of Queene <hi>Mary,</hi> and which they published in the beginning of her Maiesties raigne that last was) haue the like discription in them like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, and so like, that whereas that of <hi>Vatablus</hi> was newly set foorth but a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by <hi>Robertus Stephanus</hi> 1557. it may seeme that ours tooke their direction thence: which doe in like manner altogether omit (so far as yet I haue seene) the aforesaide heigth of the Porch. And then, whence are others to take their light, when such Torches as these do neuerthelesse in that point burne so dim? As touching the Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, the difficulty concerning them, is onely (to speake off) about the heigth of them, for that the Text doth tell vs, but of eighteene Cubites in one place, and of thirty fiue <note place="margin">1. King▪ 7. 15. 2. Chr. 3: 15.</note> in another: and so there bee that hold opinion, some, that the Pillars themselues with their Bases beneath, Chapters aboue, and their Ornaments on the tops of those their Chapters, were indeede thirty and fiue Cubites high, and yet the Pillars themselues <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Lyr. in</hi> 3. <hi>Reg.</hi> 7 <hi>in. lit. d.</hi>
               </note> but eighteene, so reconciling those places together (others) that the Pillars them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, besides their Bases, Chapters, and top-ornaments, were sixe and thirty Cubits <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Tremel. Iun. in.</hi> 1. <hi>Reg.</hi> 7: 15.</note> high, sauing that one Cubit was hid in the Base beneath, and so but fiue and thirty in sight. But, if we looke a little into the matter, we quickly meete with some doubt therein: both in respect of the Temple it selfe; and in respect of the measure that of them is giuen vs. In respect of the Temple it selfe we find, that if the Pillers were fiue and thirty Cubites high, and the Temple but thirty of the selfe-same measure, as I thinke it is likely to proue to bee, then, whether the Cubites were double as some haue conceiued, or but single, as I thinke will fall out to bee the more sure, yet were they fiue Cubites higher than it: which seemeth to be no due proportion. In respect of the measure that of them is giuen vs, it is certaine, they had but ten Cubites square to stand in, and if it be like to proue to be but of the ordinary Cubit, as it seemeth it <note place="margin">1. King. 6: 3.</note> will, then the measure it selfe for the bottom, will help to show, whether of these two
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:7530:183"/> were likelyest to be the height of them. For the pillers themselues beeing foure cubits thicke would leaue but three cubits on any side betwixt them and the Wall, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> both for their Bases to stand in, and as is most likely, for conuenient passage about them. Which being so, then foure times and an halfe their thickenesse, is as it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth more like to be their height, than eight times and three quarters, where the roome it selfe would beare no greater a Base: especially, when besides the bodyes <note place="margin">1. King. 7: 16, 17. 2. Chr. 3: 15, 16.</note> of the pillars, eyther of them had Chapters or heades of fiue cubits a piece aboue, and much other worke besides for ornaments sake reaching much higher.</p>
            <p n="3">3 These difficulties being thus farre cleared, and now being to see what may seeme to be the manner of it; I hold it best for most mens vnderstanding, that first <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> we consider of the out-side of it: then, of the inside also. On the outside of it, it seemeth to me, that it was to see too, much like (at the first blush) to the woonted or most accustomed manner of Churches or Chappels with vs, sauing that in the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting of it, and entrance into it, it did much varry from ours.

The entrance into it also was but one, and the same at the East end of it, whereas ours for the most part haue mo, and (lightly to such vse) none at the ends. It was other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise much like vnto the most accustomed manner of our Churches, for that it had <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> one maine roofe, house, or building, of free-stone without, at one end thereof shut vp with a Tower, as most of our Churches are with our Steeples: and with such like additions or buildings on the sides, as in many of our Churches the Iles or Ee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings thereof are. But then if we consider more specially of it, wee finde that the <note place="margin">1. K<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

That those lower buildings or Eelings likewise, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">1. King. 6: 5 6, 8, 10.</note> but halfe so high as the maine part of the House it selfe, appeared to be of three stories or heights, and about two yards and an halfe in height one aboue another: compassing the House round about, sauing onely at the East end of it, that they all likewise were outwardly euen, or euery Story lying forth as much other, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly reaching, the middle-most of them one cubit farther than the lowest, and the highest one cubit more than the middlemost towards the out-side of the wal of the house and close vnto it; yet not let in into it, but resting on it, by a sole-tree <note place="margin">Ibid. 6.</note> laide on a shoulder of the wall, the wall being of purpose made so thicke beneath, that it might bee taken in one cubite more on the out side of it to euery of these, three cubits in all, and yet bee thicke enough for the building. The maine part therefore of the Howse it selfe being so high aboue these lower Eeelings, lay better open to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

How this house and the Tower of it together with those Eelings beneath were couered aboue, we haue not described: but by the proportion of the residue of the worke besides, we may safely conceyne that the couering of them was suteable also vnto the rest, both for good workeman-ship and beauty too. And seeing it was the manner there, to <note place="margin">Leu. 3: 40, 42. Neh▪ 8: 16. &amp; in the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent h.

But because God himselfe had giuen them example before, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining the Court of the Tabernacle, to compasse all the Sanctuary it selfe, and see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it seemeth that otherwise the Temple should haue stoode nakedly and bare, and not with that dignity that was due vnto it: therefore it seemeth to be the likelier, that they compassed the whole Temple; and that the wordes round about, that are vsed in the description of the great Court, are to be taken, not onely to shew howe that and the inner were taken in, but also what they were in respect of the Temple, as on euery side also compassing it. Notwithstanding a doubt there is, that my selfe haue conceyued, and do not see well how to cleare it: namely, that in the same place, the like seemeth to be set downe for the Porch also. But whereas these two Courtes were open, and so such taking in as there is spoken of might well become them; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse the Porch were open too, it seemeth that this would not in like sort be sayde of that: and so, that either the Porch was open also, or else that such wormanship as this would not bee attributed vnto it. Yet not denying, but that such might bee the workmanship of it likewise, so farre as was needfull to be suteable vnto the other: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit that afterward it was reared higher (and it may be of the same worke still) vntill it came to the heigth to it appointed; and then was couered. Howsoeuer it was, two Courts there were, of what measure or quantity we know not, but such no doubt <note place="margin">1. King. 6: 36 7: 12. 2. Chr. 4: 9.</note> as were proportionable vnto the rest of the building, and meete for the vse to which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> they were taken: taken in with three rewes of fayre polished stones, and one of Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar fayrely wrought. Entering from the East into these, we come to the Porch, the front or first part of house it selfe: a Tower of no great roome within, but answerable and ioyning to the rest of the building, ten yardes one way, and fiue another, but twice so high (as the better opinion seemeth to be) as the residue of the house was <note place="margin">1. King. 6: 3. 2 Chr. 3: 4. 1594 on 1. King 6: 3 on the let c▪ In 3. Reg. 6. in lit. g.</note> long, and couered ouer aboue. In which respect, a note in some of our <hi>English</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles had need to be heeded; and would deserue, as I do take it, when once it should be wel examined, then to be amended also: and so that description of <hi>Ʋatablus</hi> too, which seemeth to haue led the way vnto ours; and that not onely for the leauing of it vncouered (which that kind of description could not beare) but also for the want of due proportion betwixr the pillars &amp; roome that they stand in, in both his figures.
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:7530:184"/> Which roome within, beeing but the Porch or entrance vnto the house it selfe, was <note place="margin">1. King. 6: 3. 2. Chr. 3: 4. <hi>Chr. Adricom. in descript.

Againe, in this sort taking it to bee a couered building, and so high, it may probably seeme, although thc Text make no such mention (as, in particular, it omitteth many thinges besides) that after a conuenient height for the lowest roome, wherein the Pillars stood, such as in proportion might be answerable to them, it had some lofts aboue for necessary vses, with conuenient way or passage into them: and that Windowes were in conuenient places disposed, both in the lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer and higher roomes, as was most meete for beauty and vse.

The space or roome of it within, about twenty yardes long, ten broad, and fifteene high: the Lights or Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes thereof beeing onely in the vpper part of the Wals thereof: all the Walles thereof beeing first reared, and the Flower couered with Stone, in very substantiall and beautifull manner: but then all seeled ouer with Caedar, on the Wals imbossed and curiously wroght: and both the sides and floure beneath, and the Timber of the Roofe aboue, all ouer-laide or couered ouer with beaten Gold, of Worke-manship sutable vnto the Mettal, and richly adorned with many precious stones besides. That which remaineth is the Holyest of all. Where againe we haue, besides a faire and <note place="margin">1. King. 6: 31, 32, 7▪ 50. 2.

The roome within, altogether of the same matter and worke-manshippe that the other was of, for the sides, floure, and roofe, for the stone <note place="margin">1. King. 6: 9, 15, 19, 19, 20. 2.

And yet doe wee reade of sixe hundred Talents of Gold to haue beene bestowed onely on it: as also, that whereas they had occasion to vse Nayles for the better setting forth of the work, for the doores and other places ouer-laid with Gold, there were they so little spating of their Gold, that one onely of the Nailes of Golde that they <note place="margin">2.

Considering how many were imployed about it; and yet it may not be denied, but that many other thinges were doone besides, of which as yet we haue not spoken:)
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:7530:185"/> yet all thinges were made so ready before, the Stone at the Quarry, and Timber <note place="margin">1.

            <p n="4">4 Hauing thus considered of the place which <hi>Salomon</hi> ordayned for the worship of God, and beeing now to consider of such thinges as were therein to that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> purpose, it shall not be amisse, seeing we were last in the holiest place of all, there like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise now to begin, &amp; so to come forth as we went in: sauing that we are first to know, that we are not to looke to haue all the roomes furnished with such as belonged vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, because diuers of them were to bee brought in by the Priestes and <hi>Leuites,</hi> and that was not done till the time of the dedication, of which we are not to speake yet, but next vnto this that now we are in. Now therefore we are but to looke for such things as it may seeme were to massie for men to beare conueniently, or such as the Priestes and <hi>Leuites</hi> were not charged withall; and therefore that <hi>Salomon</hi> made the Woorke-men to set them vp in theyr places as they were made, to bee in a readinesse against the time that they were to be vsed: and for the others that were to be brought in by the Priests and <hi>Leuites,</hi> not to looke to find them in their places, til <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> the time of the Dedication. Beginning then with the most Holy-place, there wee haue yet but the two Cherubims onely, to the likenesse of young Men, standing <note place="margin">1. King. 6: 23-28. 2. Chr. 3: 10-13.</note> on their feete, and their faces downe-ward, towardes those that came in, or towards the next Roome thereunto called the Temple, but hauing the Winges and appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Angels (not as they are in themselues beeing but Spirites, and not subiect to Mortall eie; but as it hath pleased God, that in his seruice they haue appeared to Men) themselues beeing about fiue yardes high, in such sort situate, and so stret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching out theyr Winges side-wayes, that touching together with the point of theyr <note place="margin">1. King. 6: 19.</note> Winges in the middest, with the others they reached, eyther of them to the Wall beside them. And true it is, that God hath giuen his Aungels charge, of all and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery of those that are his; euen from one ende of the World to the other: not but that himselfe onely praeserueth, maintaineth and quickneth all; but that it pleaseth him, to our comfort, to vse theer Mynistery also about vs. But whereas the others on the Lidde of the Arke, reared vp on the endes thereof, were but little ones in comparison of these, but all of Gold: these beeing much bigger, were of Timber worke within, of the Wood of the Oliue; but ouer-layde with beaten Gold. Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the next roome without, the Temple or the Holy-place, did many thinges apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine; but all of that Nature as I do take it, that were to be brought in and to be placed by the Priestes and <hi>Leuites:</hi> and therefore the relation of them meetest to be referred vnto the time of the dedication. The next vnto this was the Porch as wee sawe before: in which there was nothing that did appertaine to the charge of the Priestes or <hi>Leuites,</hi> nor any thing that might well bee carryed by men. For there were nothing therein, but onely two great Pillars of Brasse, on eyther side one, both of one worke-manship, and very fayre: the bodies of the Pillars themselues <note place="margin">1.

What their Bases were, wee haue not described: but yet wee may well conceiue, that they were sutable vnto the rest, not onely in proportion, but in workemanship also. Which two faire and stately Pillars, beeing so placed as they were, betwixt that house of God on the one side, and those Courtes of the Priestes
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:7530:185"/> and people on the other, might well bee as two visible and perpetuall witnesses vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> them, that they obseruing their part of their couenant towardes him, hee also for his part would euer bee one towardes them againe.

The next vnto this, is the Court of the Priestes, in which there were many thinges much belonging (at least by wonted vse, about the Tabernacle, vntill they came to rest in their promised Land) vnto the Office of the Priestes and <hi>Leuites:</hi> but some of them (it seemeth) too chargea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble now for them to deale with, and so most likely to bee set in theyr places by the Worke-men that made them. Those that seeme to bee to chargeable for them to deale with, were but two: the great Brazen Altar: and that great Vessell of Brasse called the Sea. The great brazen Altar was as long and broade, as the House it <note place="margin">2. Chr. 4: 1.</note> selfe was broad within, being about tenne yardes square, and fiue high, and was pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced towardes the vpper end of the Court that now we speake of. That it was of so great a square; was no more than often it needed: as also it was too little some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, <note place="margin">1 King 8: 64. 2. Chr. 7: 7.</note> for the sacrifices that were to bee offered thereon. The height also was no more, than the proportion of the breadth thereof did require: but nowe much more than the vse thereof might beare, but that it seemeth they were now allowed <note place="margin">Exod. 10: 26.</note> to goe vp by steppes thereunto, which notwithstanding was forbidden before. But that prohibition was indeed somwhat before that God appointed the Priests to haue <note place="margin">Exo. 28: 42, 43</note> Linnen Garmentes vnder theyr other Cloathes to couer their Loynes, and to hide their priuities, so often as they ministred vnto him: and so it seemeth, that now it is so much the more easily dispensed withall. Againe, by this meanes the people that should repaire thereunto, might euer better see what was doone: and so haue better exercise of their repentance &amp; Faith therby, and so belike they ascended about foure yardes or better by steppes (which, it seemeth were of Brasse likewise, and fast to the Altar) that so they might more conueniently reach towardes the middest of <note place="margin">

Martyr. in</hi> 1. <hi>Reg.</hi> 7: 51.</note> the Altar, to lay on such proportions or partes of each Sacrifice as was appointed. For that some of ours doe conceiue, by the direction of an Haebrew <hi>Rabbin,</hi> or <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> at least incline thereunto, that they had an ascending thereunto, not by steppes, but by some kinde of ascent that did rise but by little and little, euen reason it selfe may teach, that though such ascent may bee conceiued, yet could it hardly fit both the place and the seruice well. For the more easily that the ascent did rise, the farther must it spread it selfe into all the Court besides: and the Altar bearing so great a square as it did, it was needfull the ascent should be so much the higher, which of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity must needes take vp very much roome which way soeuer it lay. On the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther side if the ascent were scanted in roome, then must it bee so much the branter, especially beeing without steppes:) and then ouer slipperie to passe too and fro as that seruice required. And whether it were the one or the other, yet so must the Altar be hidden thereby for most part of it, or rather as it were buryed in it, or swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed vppe of it. But nowe put case that so it were, yet that were no helpe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the reason by the Lawe alleadged, why there should bee no ascending by <note place="margin">Exod. 10: 26:</note> steppes to the Altar: because that beeing on such an height aboue the people, and so much within the power of the winde, it forceth not then whether they came thither by steppes, or by an height softly ascending; as the top of an house, Mast, or Tree, is no more in danger for that matter, then of some height of ground thereby, as high as the other. But these hauing giuen some iudgment thereon so well as they could haue doone more commendable as I doe take it, than others that haue left it <note place="margin">

And therefore lesse maruell, if hauing forbidden <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> steps to his Altar before, when he had giuen them no such helpe to couer their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse, and when he ordained no such Altar for breadth or heigth but that other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise they might doe their seruice about it: now neuerthelesse hee appoint such an Altar for breadth and heigth, as by it selfe might argue, that now they were by steps to ascend vnto it. For whensoeuer any thing is required, then are the meanes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed also, without the which it cannot be done: and though those meanes were forbidden before, yet not in such case as this was now. And Christ himselfe, the <note place="margin">Iohn. 3: 14. 12: 32, 33.</note> onely true sacrifice, told vs plainely, the he must bee lifted vp: and so was his Altar aduaunced indeede. As also we, God be thanked for it, haue in him, a most large and beautifull Altar, whereon wee, and all the people of God together, may offer our sacrifice to GOD our Father: but so highly aduaunced withall, that wee must of necessity ascend, euen step by step, to do him that seruice. That great vessell of Brasse, called a Lake or Sea (according to the manner of the <hi>Hebrewes,</hi> calling all <note place="margin">

What the certainty of this measure was, is thought to be a thing that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> now be attained vnto, for want of the iust knowledge of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> measures: <note place="margin">

Especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, being so as is conceiued, and the most likely, that they had the vse of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <note place="margin">Rab Sal. Lyr. Pet.

For in such case a round plaine bottom, yea vessell descending aequaly round about vnto it, was more likely of it selfe to keepe cleane, than if it had so many corners, and streighter passages, as of necessity needs it must haue, if it were square. But of this we might make reasonable sure, that if either the forme of this vessell, or the measure allotted vnto it, were certainly known, they haue so good a reciprocatiue and mutuall respect one to another, that by the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of either of them, wee might come to a reasonable guesse of the other also. For if wee certainely knew of what measure the Bath was that heere is spoken off:
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:7530:186"/> then might we thereby readily finde, whether of those two formes (the whole round throughout, or else to be round but aboue, and square beneath) it was like to haue had. So likewise if we knew the forme, then would it also quickly helpe vs to finde, what was the Bath that heere is mentioned. But nowe if the Bath then were <note place="margin">Calepin. ex Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

So that if this were the measure of that great Vessell, needes must it bee much more than in such case was to bee dealt with, and not to bee placed so fitly, but onely by the workemen themselues. But beeing thus made, by <note place="margin">1. King 7: 39. 2. Chr. 4: 10.</note>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> whomsoeuer it was placed, placed it was at the entring into this Court of the Priests, on the left hand towards the South. And may well assure our selues, that although this vessell was very great, and many might wash at once about it, on the East, West, North, and South, euen out of the mouthes of those Oxen or Buls that bare it: yet the mercies of God by Iesus Christ in the Fountaine of regeneration are much grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and many in all partes of the World doe wash together at it; euen in him, whom those silly Beastes, so vsually sacrificed there, did preach vnto them. One there is, who may seeme to account that of the Tabernacle, and this of the Temple to haue <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pet. Martyr.</hi> in. 1. Reg 7: 23-26.</note> beene all one: but the greatnesse of his learning and iudgement may easily lead vs to conceiue, that hee did account them but one in respect of the vse whereunto they were both ordained; that before, and this now. And as in the Altar, so in this also it seemeth, that God would enlarge the figures and Testimonies of his graces to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <note place="margin">Exod 30: 17-21. 38: 8. 30-32.</note> vs: as the Sunne, the neerer he draweth towards his rising, the greater light he casteth among vs. Otherwise they both were indeed one so much, that the vse of this is but breefely mentioned heere, and left to be gathered out of the other there; for such as would more fully haue it. The outward Court onely remaineth, which the Temple now had more, than the Tabernacle had before. For it had but one Court for the Priestes before, wherein they were to do the seruice that to them was appointed: and if the people would offer any sacrifice, or make any Oblation to the Lord, they were to come to the doore of the Tabernacle, and there to deliuer it to <note place="margin">Leu. 1: 3. 4: 4. 14. 8: 4. 9▪ 5, 12: 6. 14: 11, 15. 29.

And so the people yet were not yet to med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with the Court of the Priestes: but yet had they now another Court allowed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them: and the same ioyning to that of the Priestes. As also God hath now not onely taken in vs <hi>Gentiles</hi> to bee of his people: but, in our High-Priest Iesus Christ, hath allowed vs all to be Priestes vnto him, and to haue our place in his holy Temple. So that this Court may well be taken before to insinuate vnto vs, that which the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <note place="margin">Isa. 56: 3-7.</note>

The time is noted by two limitations: one, that all things were first made ready; the other, what time it was of his raigne. As touching the finishing of all thinges first, that is a thing that is not onely recorded, but hath added withall, that it was done in very goodmanner: all things needfull being made <note place="margin">1.

King 6: 1 2 Chr 3: 2 Exod 12: 2 1 Kin 6: 37, 38 2 Chr 5: 3</note> in great abundance: and such thinges as were made of Brasse, to be so large and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, that the weight or valew thereof could not be reckoned. For the time of his raign it is likewise noted, that being begun in the fourth yeare of his raign, the second day, &amp; the second month of that yeare (they beginning, in this account, when the dayes and nights are of a length in the Spring of the yeare, some few dayes lightly before the midst of March with vs; and so by that reckoning about the midst of our Aprill) it was finished in the eleauenth yeare of his raigne, and in the seauenth month there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; and that the dedication thereof was in the same month also. In the businesse it selfe, whereas <hi>Salomon</hi> was purposed to haue it doone with speciall solemnity, and to that end gathered together all the chiefe of the Land, wee are first to consider of their gathering together vnto that businesse: then, of their dismissing againe when it was done. In their gathering together vnto that businesse, we are first to see, in what sort they were so assembled: then, how the businesse was performed, for which they were so gathered together. They were so assembled, for that <hi>Salomon</hi> sent for the Elders of <hi>Israell,</hi> to come vnto him to <hi>Hierusalem</hi> about that businesse: and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
               <note place="margin">1 King 8: 1-3 2 Chr 5: 2-4</note> they accordingly repaired vnto him. The performance of the businesse, that being so gathered together, they all did their parts in some good measure wel, for any thing that we read to the contrary: and we haue good likelihood that so they did, because it pleased God to take it so graciously as he did. And then were they more happie than <hi>Dauid,</hi> in his first attempt of bringing the Arke vnto Hierusalem: hee hauing that whole solemnity dasht by some ouer-sights therein committed. But these we <note place="margin">2. Sa. 6: 1-10.</note> may account to haue done their parts well, both in the substance of the busines they had in hand: and in the manner of doing it. The substance of their businesse was, first to bring in such thinges to the Temple as now they had for it: then, to worship in such sort withall, as to such action did appertaine. In bringing in such thinges to the Temple as now they had for it, some there were on whom that seruice did chiefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lye: and others besides, that by their praesence did put to their handes to helpe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the solemnity of it so well as they could. Those on whom that seruice did for the most part lye, were those that had the charge of the Tabernacle before: and <note place="margin">Exod. 28: 1. Num. 3: 5-9.</note> they were the Priestes and <hi>Leuites.</hi> And the thinges that were to bee brought in, were most of them such, as wherewith such of the <hi>Leuites</hi> as were not Priestes might deale withall, for any thing that seemeth to be to the contrary: but some other such, as now belonged to the charge of the Priestes alone, as is most likely. Such of the <hi>Leuites,</hi> as were not Priestes might deale, it seemeth, with all such thinges as belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to most of the Temple: namely, vnto the inner Court; and to the outward part of the Temple it selfe, called also the Holy-place. Vnto the inner Court appertay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned all the Pots, Basons, Fleshookes, Ash-pans, and Beezoms; yea, and all the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments of Musicke also (of this kinde: for some of them were of Gold, but not vnlikely, but that some were of Brasse also) to the Temple belonging, if they had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny moe (as not vnlikely but that in such abundance of other thinges they had:) and all those ten Bases, together with their Caldrons on them. As for those Pots, Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, and such like, yea, and those Instruments of Musicke also, wee haue no speciall <note place="margin">1 King. 7: 45, 50. 2. Chr. 4: 11, 16, 18, 19.</note> description of them, neither for the forme nor number of them: but wee may well conceiue, that they were proportionable to those that are described, and then, both that they were very beautifull or faire, and that they had great plenty of them. More <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> specially mee finde, that although all generally to this place appertaining were of Brasse; yet most of those Basons of Gold, if not all (and wee read of an hundred of <note place="margin">2. Chr. 4: 8.</note> them) did appertaine to this place also: and whereas their Beesoms are noted to bee of Brasse also, it seemeth, that all such Instrumentes are meant thereby, as whereby such places or Courts, yards, or streets, are wont to be clensed (and this place though it were well &amp; fair paued, and though they had many vessels to receiue the water they
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:7530:187"/> vsed, and the blood of the sacrifices that they shed, yet when they had great doings, as often as they had, needs must it grow foule thereby:) and that such as properly goe vnder the name of Beesoms with vs, were so deuised with them, that in stead of Twigs, theyr Bushy part was of Brasen Wire, and of such temper as would be flexible, and yet returne to the place againe. These thinges it seemeth, were all brought in by the <hi>Leuites,</hi> and in faire and decent manner (because all thinges were, by all likely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, orderly here) but yet, as it seemeth, in the first place withall, as giuing place to others that were of more speciall regard. In the next place, it seemeth to mee, came <note place="margin">1. King. 7: 27-38. 43. 2. Chr. 4: 6, 14.</note> those Bases, together with their Caldrons on them: all of Brasse, all going on wheels, and euery of them hauing four wheels a-peece for the more easie cariage of them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing otherwise very Massie and heauy. For the Caldrons themselues were about two yards wide, and, it seemeth, halfe so deepe: and containing forty Baths a-peece, they were of our measure, by our former reckoning, two Tun (allowing two hundred fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty sixe gallons to a Tunne) one barrell (allowing foure Firkings, of eyght Gallons a-peece to a Barrell) and two gallons besides. Their Bases likewise or frames, were square, about one yard and an halfe high, and two yardes square aboue: fairelie wrought, and hauing faire and fit stayes, both in the the midst, and at euery corner of the frame besides, for those Caldrons to rest vpon, and all of Brasse. The wheels, on each side two, were but halfe so high as the frame it selfe, but of brasse likewise. And so, though they were chargeable and heauy, yet being made so fit for carryage, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> to be drawne too and fro, as a man would haue them, the <hi>Leuites</hi> also being so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as they were, they might in such sort lead these with them, as would bee nothing vnseemely for the best solemnity of that so honourable and holy an action. These being on their way, it seemeth those did follow next, who carryed the holy thinges of the Temple: of which againe it seemeth, there were many thinges, though rich in themselues, and to speciall good vse; yet not altogether of such regard as were some other. So in this company also, it seemeth to me, that these were likeliest to make the way vnto the others. Of these wee haue two sortes now: one, of such as then were, as it were, Antiquate, as hauing their date out already; the other of such, as then were most to bee vsed. Such as were then, as it were, antiquate, as hauing their date out already, were the Tabernacle, and such thinges (the Arke excepted) <note place="margin">1. King. 8: 4. 2. Chr. 5: 5.</note> as thereunto appertained, were neuerthelesse nowe on their way to bee had in into the Temple, and there to be for euer reposed. Those that were then most to bee v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, were of two sortes likewise: some that were, as it were but voluntary; others that were of stricter necessity. Those we may account to be but voluntary, that <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> before had dedicated to the vse of the Temple; which <hi>Salomon</hi> also is noted to <note place="margin">1. King 7: 51. 2. Chr. 5: 1.</note> haue brought in: and so it seemeth, that these also had place in this solemnity, as well worthy they were, beeing at it seemeth both Plate and Treasure (and by likelyhood in no scant or sparing measure;) and not vnlikely as I take it, but that their place might bee heere-about also. Those that were of stricter necessity, were all those that God had commaunded, and <hi>Salomon</hi> had now made, as necessary appurtenaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces (in the serurce of God) vnto all the principall thinges to the holy place belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: as Incense-Cups, Basons, Boales, Lamps, Snuffers, Ash-pannes, and such like, <note place="margin">1. King. 7: 50, 51. 2. Chr. 4: 21. 22. 1. King. 7: 48, 49. 2. Chr. 4▪ 19, 20.</note> and diuers Instruments of Musicke heere also it seemeth, all which things heere were of pure Gold. Those others that were of more speciall regard to this place apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining, were the Golden Altar, which was for Incense or sweete perfume to bee burnt thereon; the ten golden Tables of Shew-bread, fiue to be on the one side, and fiue on the other; and tenne Golden Candlestickes, with their Lampes thereon, in which there should be lights to burn before the Lord, and to giue light to the house beneath, all the Windowes beeing aboue, That which I take to appertaine to the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Priestes alone, which also dooth onely remaine, and may seeme to come in last, and to shut vp (for those matters) the whole solemnity, and was the chiefe thing to the Temple belonging, was the Arke of Testimony, appertaining to the in-most or most <note place="margin">1. King. 8: 3, 4. 2. Chr. 5: 4, 5.</note> holy place, add the onely Iewell or glory of it; the two Cherubims there awayting, and attending the comming of it; and so was it also accordingly carried.</p>
            <p n="6">
               <pb n="358" facs="tcp:7530:188"/> 6 With these thinges therefore approaching the place where they were to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> be bestowed, and first comming to make their deliuery of such thinges as they had for the inner Court which was for the Priestes, there may we conceiue, that whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer vessels, or instruments they had, eyther for those thinges that were there before (as for the great brasen Altar for the better or more seemely dispatch of their sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, or for the great Sea for the readier supplying of it with water so oft as neede should be) or for those Caldrons that now they brought with them for the readier supplying of them likewise: all those and euery of them did they there bestow in their places, as to euery one did appertaine. Those ten Caldrons also did they bestow in their places, fiue on the one side, and fiue on the other: so furnishing the whole <note place="margin">1. King. 7: 39. 2. Cht. 4: 6, 14.</note> roome, with great plenty, and readinesse to wash as neede should require. And bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed bee God, that we also, in Iesus Christ, are so prouided and haue such facility of making our oblations and sacrifices to God our Father: and that, when euery where, and in all thinges we do so readily offend, in him likewise we haue euery where such aboundance of water, and in such readinesse to clense vs againe. And whether those wheeles of theirs were the more readily to beare them some little way foorth or not, when they were empty (for the more honour of the place) there to be filled, &amp; then to come in readily againe: certaine it is, that we can no sooner haue any sensible fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of our vncleannesse, with a sound desire to be clensed therefro, but that we haue a readier and speedier clensing in him, than for any earthly thing whatsoeuer, any earthly wheeles could helpe vs vnto. But this is sure, that whereas by the holy Commandements of God, wee finde our selues to be foule, obseruing not one, but guilty in all, as they be ten, and euery of them charging vs with great vncleanesse: so heere haue we ten vessels likewise, euery of them yeelding great plenty of water, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> altogether, a great deale more, to clense vs withall. Then holding on their way by those two vntainted, credible, and standing witnesses, that cleauing to God, hee faileth not vs, and passing into the Temple or Holy-place, though there they finde great riches, &amp; excellent beauty: yet do these bring those things with them, in which those riches, and all that beauty, haue, as it were, euen all their being. For these bring with them, all those Tables of Shew-bread, those Candlesticks also, and the <note place="margin">1. King. 7. 48, 49. <hi>Tremel. Iun.</hi> 2. Chr. 4: 7, 8, 19-21. 1. King. 6: 20, 22.</note> Altar of sweete perfume: all being of gold themselues, or richly ouer-laid therewith; and all pointing to Iesus Christ, the honour and glory of all the whole building, and of all things therein. By those Tables of Shrew-bread, giuing vs to vnderstand, that euer there is sustenance in the Church of God: by those Candlestickes and their Lampes burning on them, that the people of God euer haue light; and by that Altar of sweete perfume, that our selues though otherwise odious, and our seruice to him, though otherwise exceeding vnsauoury in it selfe, are neuerthelesse made acceptable in him: and whereas there was but one Table of Shew-bread before, and but one Candlesticke also, and of either ten now (fiue for the one side, and fiue for the other, that both those Mysteries might on both sides be witnessed vnto vs) we may therein plainly behold, laying our experience thereto, that in those matters the goodnesse of God is very much enlarged vnto vs. Neither are we to doubt, but that as the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and Candlesticks do in number answere the Commandements now: so do eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Commandements minister both food and light vnto vs; especially leading vs vnto Christ, in whom we haue both in plentifull measure. All which as they bring in, so do they set in their places likewise, &amp; whatsoeuer vessels and other instruments belonged vnto them, or to the place where now we are: all which were of pure gold. <note place="margin">1. King. 7: 50. 2 Chr. 4: 8, 22. 2. Chr. 5: 5. 1. King 7: 51. 2. Chr. 5: 1.</note> They bring in likewise the Tabernacle of the Congregation, and all the holy vesselles thereof: and the things that <hi>Dauid</hi> had dedicated. In that the Tabernacle and the holy things thereof were now brought in, it may seeme, that now they shoulde rest, hauing serued their tlme already: the Temple and the things thereof beeing now to succeed, and to serue for the time ensuing, as they had serued before till now. We also, we trust, when we haue serued our time, shall then be laide vp in a blessed fruiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of eternall glory. In that the things that <hi>Dauid</hi> had dedicated were now brought in, we neede not to doubt, but that we can dedicate neyther our selues nor any thing else vnto the Lord, according as he hath taught vs to doe, but that in time, both wee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
               <pb n="355" facs="tcp:7530:188"/> and ours shall be brought in: and that where Religion was indeede, there dedicated things before were truly brought in; and not either with-held or withdrawn, as they are since ouer often with vs. Where these things were laide vp, or how they were placed, it is not declared: but in the most Holy-place there was reasonable good roome also, besides the place that now we are in; and in the vpper part of the Porch, as it seemeth. Of the vpper part of the Porch there is noted before sufficient for this matter. The Temple or Holy-place that now we are in, was twice so big as the Most-holy: but then had it many things therein. The Most-holy beeing but halfe so bigge, was neuerthelesse tenne yardes square, and otherwise had nothing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in but onely the two Cherubimmes as yet: whome wee may conceyue to be set so neere to the Temple or Holye-place, that they left beyonde them, better than two parts of the three, of the whole roome voyde beyond them. For the Cherubims must so stand, that they might spread their in-most winges ouer the <note place="margin">1. King. 8: 6-8. 2. Chr. 5. 7. 9. Exod. 25: 10. 1. King. 8: 8. 2. Chr. 5. 9.</note> Arke: and the Arke, it selfe being but about an ell long (and to stand long-wise, is the most aduantage for it that now wee speake of) must be placed so neere to the partition betwixt these two houses, that the barres of the Arke being drawne but a little forthward might haue the ends of them seene in the Holy place or Temple, whereinto the Priests were daily to come. So much then of the roome of this house remaining so voide, it is not vnlikely (for any thing that I do see to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary) but that these things might there be reposed: especially the Tabernacle and the holy things thereof, of which there was no farther vse now to be had; and this place it selfe though the Most-holy, not too good for it neither, in respect of the reckoning it was of before, and the vse that then it yeelded. For therein also was the Most-holy: and the likelier it is that it should rather sanctifie the residue that was all one with it; than that the residue should be any abasing at all vnto it. And God be thanked for it, it is no doubt with vs, but that if he do vouchsafe vs to be of his Holy-place heere, he will also receiue vs vnto the fruition of those eternall and most glorious habitations of his there, such also as cannot be but Most-holy. As for those things which <hi>Dauid</hi> had dedicated, though those were most likely to be elsewhere bestowed, because it seemeth they were holy Vessels or treasure, such as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> sometimes they should neede to vse: yet so farre as such vse of them should not oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion any other repairing thither than was allowed, euen those also were like e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to bee of that dignity with them, that there also they might haue place, or some part of them, if the trust and charge of them were to the High-priest onely committed, and if there were no farther businesse with them, than without im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment to his other seruice he might dispatch when orderly he was to come in. Howbeit it seemeth rather, that they were such things as were diuers times to bee vsed: and so to bee elsewhere bestowed. But we neede not to doubt, but that if truly we consecrate or dedicate our selues vnto God, he will accept of vs in so gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious manner, as that euen the holyest place of al shall at no time be barred vnto vs. <note place="margin">1. King. 8: 6-8. 2 Chr. 5: 7-9.</note> Hauing done heere, then were the Priests to set the Arke in the place for it proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, a little within the Most-holy place, vnder the winges of the two Cherubims: and then to draw forthward (from the West to the East) the endes of the barres so farre, as that they might somthing appeare in the Holy-place without, and yet the other ends not forsaking their rings neyther. At which time it is plainely noted, <note place="margin">1. King. 8: 9. 2. Chr. 5: 10. Hebr. 9: 4.</note> that there was nothing in the Arke, but onely those two Tables of stone of the Ten Commaundements; about which diuers of our Writers trouble themselues more than needeth, because of a place of the Apostle, which seemeth to say: that other things were there besides. But the Apostle speaketh of a former time: &amp; because these were not so needefull as these, nor so propper to that very place originally; therefore, is it lesse maruell, if since they were lost, or elsewhere bestowed. A mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that may seeme to teach vs, that God would not alwayes haue his people to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on such rudiments (as that pot of <hi>Manna,</hi> and <hi>Aarons</hi> rod, were Testimonies how God had fed their Fathers, and how he detested that any should approach as Priest vnto him but onely such as him-selfe allowed) but that hee would haue the word onely to suffice them now: and withall, that he hauing a greater care for our
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:7530:189"/> sakes for the preseruation thereof, than of the others (though those also were rich Iewels) we in like sort, to his glory, should be more regardfull to his worde, and carefull to keepe it, than any other Treasure of earthly wisedome, or whatsoeuer goodthings of that kinde besides. But as touching this manner of placing the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Arke in the place Most-holy, in such sort that the barres thereof should appeare a little within the Temple adioyning vnto it, as it behooueth vs to consider of the meaning of it: so is there iust occasion giuen likewise, not to omit the maner ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For the meaning of it, I thinke it best, that we begin with the first institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it. So do we finde, that the Arke was ordained for those two Tables of stone wherein the Ten-Commandements were written: and that, whereas while <note place="margin">Exod. 25: 14-16.</note> they were in the wildernesse and trauelling there, they had euer to carry the same with them, the barres likewise whereby it was to be carried, were euer to bee in their places ready. A plaine document to them, that they were to haue a speciall regard vnto those Commandements, to obserue and keepe them in all their waies, so neere as they could. All which time of their trauell there, and diuers times in their Countrey after, they had such sight of the Arke, as might renew that regard vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap> now at this time it was to be shut vp generally from the sight of them all: for that the people were to come but onely vnto the outward Court as it seemeth, and but the Priests and <hi>Leuites</hi> into the inward; and but the Priestes onely into the Temple or Holy-place, and that but by course, when their time was to serue; and but the High Priest onely into the Most-Holy or inmost place of the Temple, &amp; but once in the yeare neither, where that Arke was to be reposed now. In which case wee may readily see, that it was to very good purpose, that the ends of the barres, being euer in a readinesse for the carriage of the Arke if need should bee, should neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse be so disposed, as that withall they might cast themselues (or some part of them) into the eies or sight of the Priests, that still by course and order came in, to doe such seruice in the Temple as was appointed: that they being the teachers of the people, might so be put in mind by those two witnesses, how carefully they ought to teach the people to haue speciall regard in all their waies to those holy Commandements. And whereas it is noted by diuers, and reason it selfe teacheth that so it must be, that those ends of the barres reaching out to the vaile, and butting somewhat hardly vppon it, should in those two places beare it forth more than in others, and so make those two places of the vaile somewhat like to a womans breasts: true it is, that if the Priestes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> should take so good regard thereat, that they thereupon would more diligently teach the people those Commaundements, so might those two swellings of the vaile, made by those two ends of the barres, be iustly accounted as very motherly papes indeede, yeelding foorth such milke to the Children. The manner of it is somewhat harder: yet not in it selfe, for any thing that I can find therein; but onely by the inordiate hast of such as haue written thereon, setting downe their iudgement of diuers particulars, before they haue considered of altogether, and thē framing their iudgement of those that follow, by others mistaken going before. For amending of which, the best way to me seemeth to be, first to set downe that which is certaine and plainely declared: then, thereby to determine of that which is not so plainely set downe, and therefore left more vncertaine vnto vs. Certaine it is and plainely declared, that those two Cherubins which <hi>Salomon</hi> made, were so set in the inner House, or the Most Holy-place, that as with their outward wings they reached to the wals or sides of the house, <note place="margin">2. K. 6: 23-28. 2. Chr. 5: 7-10. 1. King. 8: 7-8. Chr. 5: 7, 8.</note> so their inward Wings meeting together should bee directly ouer the Arke, and the barres thereof aboue. But now if the inner Wings of the Cherubins did where they met, couer the Arke and the bares thereof aboue, then must the Arke of necessity be vnder their wings so meeting together. Certaine it is againe, that the Arke it selfe was but two Cubits and an halfe long, or about an ell with vs. How long the barres <note place="margin">Exod. 25: 10. 37: 1. 39: 42, 43.</note> thereof were, it is not declared: but then wee are to conceiue, that they were of such length as was most conuenient. For as touching that that is reported by some, that certaine of the <hi>Hebrews</hi> held them to bee ten Cubites or fiue yardes long, which, it <note place="margin">

And so the Arke, being thus placed, should be full two yards within the Most-holy, leauing the other cubit or halfe yarde (of the barres) to pierce into the Temple or out-most place: and so should the Cheru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bims that <hi>Salomon</hi> made, stand (in the midst, from side to side) about halfe an Ell farther within, that so the meeting of their in-most winges might be iust ouer the midst of the Arke, and of the barres aboue or vpper ends of them, &amp; ouer the mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the wings of those others that were on the lid that was made by <hi>Moses.</hi> So likewise if the sides of the Arke be taken more generally to signifie both the sides <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> and the ends, and so the barres being put through rings at the ends, the Ark it selfe was flat-long carried and placed heere (for that is the iudgement of diuers) then the <note place="margin">

But the former of these I should thinke most likely, sauing that one place there is, that seemeth rather to make for the latter; namely, the sprinckling of the bloud East-ward, on the Mercy-seat once a year by <note place="margin">Leu. 16: 14.</note> the High-Priest: which seemeth more meete to haue beene on the full side there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of than on the end, which should haue beene, if long-way it stood East and West.

In the Tabernacle before, I take it, there is no quaestion with any; but that both the ends were loose, and neither of them made fast to the wall by which they hung; and that, as so it affoorded enterance at either end of the vaile, so it was there likewise taken: as also it is the manner in al such roomes as are hung, so to cast the hangings, as that in such sort they fall fit with the doores that are to bee vsed.

The Cherubims also I grant, if there heigth be not considered, may seeme to barre all enterance that way, in stretching out their Wings so close to the wall: but so would they doe euery where else besides. Howbeit for this matter there is <note place="margin">1. King. 6: 27.</note> no doubt to be conceiued. These Cherubs we speake of, were as it were young men <note place="margin">2.

            <p n="7">7 Of those on whom this seruice did not so properly lie, but yet now attended <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> to helpe forward this solemnity, with their praesence so well as they could, there were, as it may seeme, two principall sorts: of which we haue certaine knowledge for the one sort of them; and but probability for the other. Those of whom wee <note place="margin">1. Kin. 8. 1-3. 2. Chr. 5: 2-4.</note> haue certaine knowledge, were King <hi>Salomon</hi> himselfe, and those Elders &amp; Heads of the Tribes, euen the flower of all the Land, that at this time hee had gathered together. For of those we haue it plainly set down, both that the King himselfe was there: and that those Elders together with the people did accordingly repaire vnto <note place="margin">Ibid. 5: 6. Ibid. 2, 3, 5. 3, 4, 6.</note> him and attend him therein. Of those of whom we haue no certainety but onely probability, some of them were of the same people: others, but strangers. Of that people it seemeth, that the Queene, King <hi>Pharoes</hi> Daughter, whom King <hi>Salomon</hi>
               <note place="margin">1.

King. 14: 21</note> by the age of <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> being one and thirty yeares old when he began to raigne, immediately after his Father, who had raigned but fourty yeares) and if hee had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others then (as it may well bee that he had) these I say it may seeme, were some part of this assembly, and by them, many other of the Princesses, Ladies, and chiefe
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:7530:190"/> women in <hi>Israel:</hi> because this assembly was not of any ciuill affaires, but altogether religious, and about a speciall seruice of God, wherein both the godlyer sort of the women them-selues would be desirous to bee partakers, and not vnlike, but that their husbands (at least the better sort of them) would haue a speciall regarde to it also. Of strangers likewise it seemeth that many were at this assembly, not onelie for the solemnity of it (as it is the manner of strangers, on such occasions oft to come in on euery side, especially such as are well affectioned to the Princes or people to whom they come) but much rather because hee had rule ouer all those Kinges and <note place="margin">1.

Our selues in like manner are much beholding to GOD, if it please him at any time to vouch-safe vs the fauour, to doe any speciall seruice vnto him: so farre off is it, that hee is any way beholding to vs, when wee doe him the best seruice that wee are able. And whether <hi>Salomon</hi> had respect or not, vnto him whom that Temple did figure, Iesus Christ, when hee craued, that in that place GOD would be so fauourable vnto the Prayers of his people: true it is, that in him it pleaseth GOD euer to heare vs, and in none other in Heauen nor in Earth. When <hi>Salomon</hi> had thus farre dealt with the Lord, then turning to the people, hee <note place="margin">1. King. 8: 54-61.</note>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> put them also in minde how deepely they were beholden vnto God: and exhorted them euer to stand in his holy feare. Then proceeding in theyr Sacrifices, both the King and the people brought in so plentifully, that the Altar was for that time a great <note place="margin">1. King. 8: 64. 2. Chr. 7: 7.</note> deale to little, and they were faine to vse therein a great part of the Court it selfe; euen theyr Peace-offeringes themselues were so many (of which there was but some little part of them burnt to the Lorde, and so the lesse roome would serue them▪ but for the great multitude of them:) insomuch, that those that are ascri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to <hi>Salomon</hi> onely, were two and twenty thousand Beeues, and one hundred <note place="margin">1. King. 8: 62, 63. 2. Chr. 7: 4, 5.</note> and twentye thousand Muttons: and when account is made of those that not onely <hi>Salomon</hi> offered, but wherein all the whole Congreation had theyr handes in besides, then it is sayde, that they could not bee numbred for multitudes. But <note place="margin">2. Chr. 5: 6.</note> all the charge was not in these, for that they were to adde to euery of these a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine quantity of very fine Flower, besides Wine, Oyle, Fanckensence, and Salt: the verie Flower which at that time was to goe with theyr Sacrifices onely besides,
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:7530:191"/> that which was otherwise spent (allowing according to the Lawe, to euery of those <note place="margin">Num. 15: 1-12</note> Beeues, as it were, three pottles of our measure, and to euery of those Muttons two) comming to about two thousand three hundred fourescore and ten quarters or bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. But as touching the multitude of these Sacrifices, being as they were but Peace-offeringes, there was but little of them to be consumed with fire, as the fat of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes the Kidnies and Rumpes: all the rest going (the Priestes Fees onely excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) to the vse of those that brought in those Sacrifices, wherewithall to Feast them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues before the Lord. Insomuch, that whereas the more able sort did by likely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood at this time sacrifice for themselues, and so feasted on their owne, that ouer-plus of <hi>Salomons</hi> Sacrifices, beeing so many as they were, might serue very well for great contentment to all the meaner sort of the people then gathered together. And true it is, that the true worshippe of God would euer haue liberality and Charity ioyned withall: and indeede, is not, but where it hath those also attending. This beeing the substance of their businesse, the manner of doing it that now we speake of, was no more but this, that there were a number of the Priestes and <hi>Leuites,</hi> that beeing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
               <note place="margin">2.

As with vs also, we should not onely haue our ioy in the Lord, when it so falleth out that we doe reioyce: but farther that wee should still endeauour our selues to ioy in him, and euer stirre vp our selues vnto it. How graciously it pleased GOD to take it, wee haue declared vnto vs, both at that praesent, and the night ensuing besides. At that praesent, as the Priestes and <hi>Leuites</hi> were in theyr ministration, and <hi>Salomon</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. Chr 5: 13, 14. 7: 1-3. 1.

Insomuch, that all the company tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched there-with (as it was great reason they should) gaue glory to GOD, for that so comfortable and plaine demonstration of his so gracious fauour towardes them: GOD so testifying, that hee graciously accepted of this theyr seruice, and would accept of them in him that was to come, by that house nowe repraesented vnto them. The next night ensuing hee appeared to <hi>Salomon,</hi> and tolde him that hee <note place="margin">1. Kings. 6: 11-13. 9: 1-9. 2. Chro. 7: 11-22. <hi>Tremel. et Iun.</hi> in 2. Chr. 8▪ 2.</note> had heard his Prayer, and accepted of the House hee had built vnto him: and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all assured him of great fauour, if hee persisted in his holy feare; but other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, threatened very heauy and strange iudgements, both to his people, and to that fayre and gloryous House that hee had builded. Neyther are wee at any time so ready to serue the Lorde, as hee is, both to accept of, and to reward all such our seruice, if it bee right, and that in most gracious and liberall manner: and yet must wee take heede wee doe not praesume, hee beeing altogether as readie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, seuerely to chastice if neede require. All which solemditie of this dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, <note place="margin">1.

Out of which wee also may conceiue (because all thinges were so much in figures then) that a time will bee, when all the faithfull in Iesus Christ, shall Feast with him for euer in aeternall glorie: as now also, euen in this World, euen in the middest of all theyr labours and sufferinges, doe neuerthelesse in Spirite Feast with him now, euen all the World ouer.

For as for such rare and singular workes, the more glorious they are in the eye of others, the more willingly can wee bee occupyed about them: but as for thinges that are more ordinary, and with most men not of that reckoning, though of as great moment as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, yet seldome goe we so readily about them. But letting it alone whether of the two were the more commendable, both of them being the seruice of God, and by him required, certaine it is, that euen this also was very commendable, and a singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar good proofe of his zeale and godlinesse then. And so with vs also, it were a worke of rare aestimation (to bee aesteemed, as the worth of it would deserue) if such as sit at the sterne with vs, would carefully vphold and maintaine, for the furtherance of Gods holy seruice, such things as were well disposed before by our good Elders, according to the word of God generally, and as God himselfe more specially led the way vnto vs by his example. But many of vs are so impotently giuen to reare vp some new works of our owne deuise, and so egged on by the vnsatiable and profane greedinesse of others, that we rashly pull downe what we finde to such end set vp al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> before that euer our dull heades can conceiue, to how good purpose the same was reared and left vnto vs.</p>
            <p n="8">8 As touching the glory where-with it pleased God to cloath him, there <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> bee strange thinges reported thereof: but therein also he was a figure of Christ; and blessed be God that hee would giue so comfortable a patterne in him, to shew what may be the the reward of well doing euen heere on earth, so farre, as the wisedome of God shall not at any time find it vnmeete for his Children heere. That which is spoken of his glory, dooth most of it but respect himselfe: but part of it, his people also. That which doth respect but himselfe, is, first in the thing that himselfe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired God to giue him: then, in that farther augmentation, that it pleased God (of his owne goodnesse) to giue him besides. The thing that himselfe desired God to giue him, was, as wee saw before, but wisedome: in which, what his glory was, we haue set downe, first, but simply in it selfe; but then, by the way of comparison also. Simply in it selfe it is said, that as God promised to giue him wisedome in great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure <note place="margin">1 King 4: 29. 5: 12</note> so did he indeede; insomuch that out of it, both hee indited or wrote three thousand parables or Prouerbes, sentences of profound and great wisedome, and <note place="margin">1 King. 4: 32, 33</note> one thousand and fiue Songs or Sonnets, belike, by the help of those, the better to let in wisedome to others; and was able likewise, well to discourse of the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Vertue, or Nature of all these inferiour Creatures. By the way of comparison it is sayde likewise, that in wisedome hee excelled, not onely all the Kinges of the <note place="margin">1 King. 10: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

That farther augmentation that it pleased God of his owne goodnesse to giue him besides, was, of such thinges as most men doe most desire, and very often follow after, where there is some speciall measure of wisedome going before: a thing so much the rather in this case to bee noted, for that, although whatsoeuer of such thinges hee had, it all proceeded of the good guift of GOD vnto him; yet for the obtaining, or farther aduancing of some part of it, he vsed the wisedome that God had giuen him. So it shall not bee amisse, distinctly to marke, both what it was that God did farther giue him; and, howe himselfe came to the fruition or benefite of it. That which God did farther giue him, wee may plainely finde in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise that thereof hee made vnto him: and so doe wee finde, that it consisted of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> two principall fauours; Riches, and Honor. That he was specially blessed with ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, <note place="margin">1.

Chr. 8: 11.</note> Daughter of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> whom hee had marryed (and then brought her into it, there to dwell: as Iesus Christ also prouideth for his Spouse a glorious habitation in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly Hierusalem, and will not faile, when all thinges are ready to bring her thither) and two others for himselfe, one, in <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> the other, in the Forrest of <hi>Libanus:</hi>

Of which, his own House or Pallace in Hierusalem is plainly noted to haue beene in building thirteene years (a great probability, that it was a very sumptuous thing) &amp; not only his magnificence and correspondency of his other works do both of them boad, that all these his woorkes were, in their kinde, very sumptuous and faire, but the Text it self likewise doth so affirme it of some part of them, that we may <note place="margin">1. Kin. 7: 7-11.</note> well conceiue the like of the whole. In like manner, those two hundred Targets, and three hundred Shieldes, or Bucklers (for these were the lighter) all of beaten <note place="margin">1. King. 10: 16 17. 2. Chr. 9: 15, 16. 2. Chr. 9: 20.</note> Gold, euery Target weighing better then eighteene poundes, and euery Buckler better than nine (after two of these Sickles to an ounce sterling with vs) and that all his drinking Vessell or Plate was of Gold, and all the Vessell of the <hi>Libanon</hi> (not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Plate, but other necessary implements besides, it seemeth, that being an house of pleasure) of Gold likewise, are all great witnesses, that his riches or treasure was great: besides that, the Text it selfe dooth witnesse, that therein hee exceeded all the <note place="margin">1. King. 10: 23. 2. Chr. 9: 23</note> Kinges of the Earth; and then could it not bee, but that himselfe was very well sped. That in like sort hee was specially blessed with honour, although it followeth on the other so readily (as for the most part it doth) that the other going before, this dooth necessarily follow after; yet haue we more special declaration of it also: partly among <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> his owne people at home; but especially with others abroad. At home he raigned ouer them all: and such of the <hi>Canaanites</hi> as his praedecessors could not expell, those <note place="margin">1. King. 4: 1. 1. K 9: 20, 21. 2. Chr. 8▪ 7. 8. 1.

Abroad likewise hee raigned ouer all the Kings, from <hi>Euphra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> vnto the <hi>Philistims,</hi> and the Land of <hi>Aegypt:</hi> and it seemeth that the Kings round about him, eyther brought or sent in to <hi>Salomon</hi> their praesents yearely; euen all the Kinges of <hi>Arabie,</hi> and the Princes or great men of the Countrey there-about. At least he had comming in (from among them, it seemeth) sixe hundred threescore and sixe Talents of Gold yearely, besides that which the Merchants brought in, and the tribute of <hi>Hiram</hi> only, the King of <hi>Tyrus,</hi> is noted to haue beene one hundred and twenty Talentes of Gold likewise. And besides these that ought such duty vnto him, both Princes and people came from all quarters to be acquainted with the wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>Salomon,</hi> and to see his honour and glory: and among others, one speciall example we haue deliuered vnto vs of the Queene of the South. But as her exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple is more specially set downe vnto vs, so haue wee more speciall instruction thereby likewise deliuered: first in that her comming vnto him; then, that she was so well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued. In that her comming vnto him, that she came so painefull, and chargeable a iourney: and that she came with hard quaestions, or with such doubts, as wherein her selfe was not yet resolued. For so should we also, not sticke for paine nor char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, to attend the Gospell when we haue it among vs: and thereunto bring whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer doubts we haue conceiued in matters towards God, and whatsoeuer hard points we light on, and seeke to bee thereby resolued. And true it is, that the Spouse of Christ heere in this World, a Queene likewise, and crowned with glory, and all the true members thereof, doe in such sort seeke vnto Christ, and to the Gospell, as she did vnto <hi>Salomon:</hi> and whosoeuer they are that doe not, themselues doe sufficiently shew thereby, without any other proofe at all, that they are none of that companie. In that she was so well resolued, both in her quaestions, that she had all made plaine vnto her: and in that wisedome of his, that shee founde it much more than was reported, and therefore, that those Seruants of his, were happy that did attend him: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> we may safely gather, both that so we might bee resolued in all our doubtes or hard points whatsoeuer; and that the wisedome thereof is a great deale deeper than wee were aware of, as also that it maketh those happy for euer that doe attend it. How
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:7530:192"/> himselfe came to the fruition or benefite of this that God so promised vnto him, it is good so much the rather to marke, for that it may seeme that he sought the same im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderately: partly, in his dyet; but chiefely, in some others besides. In his dyet it seemeth, he was somewhat immoderate, in that he raised it to so great a proportion: his dayly expences being better than foure and thirty of our quarters of fine Flower, <note place="margin">1. King. 4: 22, 23.</note> threescore and eyght of Meale, ten Oxen stall-fed, twenty out of the pastures, and an hundred Weathers, besides Venison, Wilde-Foule, and all such like. In disposing Officers to that purpose in such sort as he did, and as it seemeth not dealing praecisely <note place="margin">1 Kings 4: 7-19, 27, 28</note> by the Tribes, but diuiding the whole land that should be liable thereunto into twelue seuerall partes, for euery month one (of whom one of them had threescore walled <note place="margin">Ibid 13, 19</note> Citties in his part, another as much as two Kinges had before, whatsoeuer the others had of theirs) as also in his other Officers besides, no doubt his wisedome plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared: <note place="margin">1 King 4: 2-6 9: 23. 2 Chr 8: 10</note> but he was very sumptuous; and his people after complayned, that hee was very chargeable vnto them. And thing heerein noteth a speciall moderation, and it may be a godly care besides, that being so mighty a Prince as he was, and hauing so many Princes about him as would bee glad of his alliance, neuerthelesse hauing two Daughters that we read of, he marryed them to his owne subiectes, to two of those his Officers aforesaide. Those other thinges besides, wherein it may chiefely seem <note place="margin">1 Kin 4: 11, 15</note> that he dealt for those earthly thinges immoderately, were the prouision he made for so many Horses and Charets: <note n="b" place="margin">1 Kin 9: 26-28. 10: 22 2 Chr. 8: 17, 18. 9: 2</note> and his nauigations for Gold: <note n="c" place="margin">Deut. 17: 16, 17.

And though as yet <hi>Salomon</hi> hath good commendation for godlynesse, vntill that afterward he fell so fouly as hee did, and in many thinges gaue good proofe of the same; yet, seeing such warning was before so plainely giuen him, and himselfe so pittifully afterward fell (and in such sort, as was likely enough by his abundance to be something occasioned) and seeing it seemeth, that Christ therefore aduanced the beauty of a silly and common flower, aboue all that royalty of <hi>Salomon,</hi> as hauing but that beauty that God did giue it, and hee not contenting himselfe with it, but still endeuouring by the wisedome that God had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> him, and by his industry to aduance it farther: therefore is there great probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity left vnto vs to doubt, that herein he some-thing passed those boundes of mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration that he ought to haue kept; not, but that God himselfe did meane both those vnto him in very ample and great measure, but that he holpe forward the same more than for his part he should haue done. As for example, when seede was promised to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and the blessing to <hi>Iacob,</hi> neyther of them aboad so firme as they ought, expecting the performance at the handes of God; but eyther of them added their owne industry withall immoderately: the former, by getting <hi>Ismaell</hi> of <hi>Agar;</hi> the other, by praeuenting his Brother, and by circumuenting his Father. Or as it is the manner of the great men of the World to do, who, when God hath giuen them by descent or birth, lands, or goods in plentiful measure, do not so content themselues with that liberality of his towards them, that they nothing labour to better theyr e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state therein, but rather to aduance the glory of him who hath so farre aduanced them: but on the other side, being gotten so high already, they make it a meane e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer to get higher and higher, or still to lay more vnto that which God before had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vnto them. But as if <hi>Salomon,</hi> hauing so great and large a promise had nowe altogether sequaestred himselfe from those matters, letting GOD alone with them, and had giuen himselfe fully and wholy, to the aduancement of Gods glory and good of his people, he might so haue done much better seruice to God, and haue beene more answereable vnto those speciall fauours of God towards him: euen so, might all our great men of the world do maruellous great seruice to God, and bee a blessing of wonderfull comfort vnto their brethren, if being so well prouided alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, they should altogether giue themselues to the aduancement of Gods glory, and to the good of their inferiors with whom they liue; and in such sort likewise might they become a great deale more answereable vnto God for his fauors towards them, than by so busie endeuouring themselues as they do, either still to be climbing high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, or else to grow greater and greater. But such is the corruptinn of our Nature, and so vnlucky (as it were) are the Children of men to so speciall fauours heere,
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:7530:193"/> that seldome it is seene, that such as are most blessed of GOD, with the good things of the World, doo any good there-with to others that stand in need: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> but altogether imploy them about themselues, or otherwise lauish them they care not how, rather than any way they shoulde bee auaileable to those that neede. That part of his glory that respected his people withall, consisteth in two principall points: one, that touched their persons neerer; others, that more appertained vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their estate. That which touched theyr persons neerer, was, that hee made <note place="margin">1 King. 9: 22 2 Chr. 8: 9</note> no bondmen of them, to bee imployed in seruile businesse, but that they were his men of War, Captaines or Officers, imployed in some good place or other. Those <note place="margin">1 King. 4: 20, 24, 25</note> that more appertained vnto their estate, were, that the King himselfe being in peace with all his neighbors round about him; his people also liued in great peace all his dayes, grew very many, and comfortably enioyed their owne; and that in his dayes there was such plenty of Gold, that Siluer was then little esteemed; and <note place="margin">1 Kings 10: 21, 27 2 Chr 1: 15, 9: 20, 27</note> that whereas Cedars were a rare and dainty wood with them before, he in his time brought them to be very rise among them. And true it is, that in the kingdome of Iesus Christ, the true <hi>Salomon,</hi> none of his people are seruily kept vnder the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of sinne; but in great peace and freedome, and in their great prosperity con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually keepe feast in the Lord: also, that the pure gold of the holinesse and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse of Iesus Christ, is of so great plenty with them by faith in him, that the Siluer-righteousnesse euen of the Angels and best Saints in Heauen, is (in that rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning) of no value with them. Much lesse do they (in that reckoning) account of their owne: and yet do they see and will not deny, but acknowledge to the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and praise of God, that whereas the lande was euery where pestered but with wilde Fig-trees in those dayes of their ignoraunce before, they finde it futnished with comfortable store of faire Cedars in these dayes of the Gospell now.</p>
            <p n="9">9 In that latter part of <hi>Salomons</hi> raigne, which did odde so farre contrary to the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> forepart of it, that therein we might learne, not to looke for any perfection heere, we haue deliuered vnto vs, first in what sort he fell: then, howe it pleased God to chastice him for it. His fall was such, as did not rest in his owne person only; but ouer-threw others withall. His owne person was very much touched there-with, first by his loose carriage euen before men: but then soone after, euen before God. In his cariage before men, it could not be but a great touch and blemish vnto him, and an euill example to others, partly, that he tooke pleasure so much in the things of this world: but especially in that hee married so many wiues, and those for the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> most part idolatrous also, and such as God had forbidden to all his people. That he tooke his pleasure much in the things of this world, may sufficiently appeare, in that he gathered Treasure together so much as he did, and in all things so much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uanced his owne glory. Himselfe afterward granteth that so he did: but then ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth withall, that all was vanity. In matters of wedlocke, that hee would haue so <note place="margin">Eccle. 211-11.</note> many, it was great Intemperance, and a bad example to others: in that they were such as were so ill qualified for Religion, and such as God otherwise forbad, it argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <note place="margin">1 King. 11: 3</note> no regard of his owne safety, nor to that inhibition of God; and therein also was a dangerous example to others, such as might soone corrupt all generally. That soone after he became so offensiue to God also, that hee declared himselfe to bee highly offended with him therefore, we are to consider, not onely what his offence was then: but also, what a speciall lesson is thereby giuen vnto all. His offence was then, very foule and grosse idolatry, whereunto he was brought by those ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous wiues of his: they, notwithstanding all his wisedome, peruerting him soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner <note place="margin">1 Kin 11: 1-10</note> from the true God; than he thereby could conuert them from those vain Idols of theirs. That speciall lesson that by this so great a fall of his is giuen vnto others, is, that if he could so ill weild so great prosperity and so high estate, being likewise so incomparably furnished as he was with wisedome: it is not to bee coueted so as it is, to grow more wealthy, or to be higher, because heereby it is made plaine vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs, that without all question it is a very dangerous estate for any man liuing to holde his feete in. That others were ouer-throwne by this fall of his, it doth not onely appeare by the words of <hi>Ahijah</hi> the Prophet, but may easily bee other-wise <note place="margin">1 King 11: 33</note>
               <pb n="365" facs="tcp:7530:193"/> conceiued: both because any euill course in the Prince doth readily infect the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple also; and because they also were partakers with him in the punishment that for it was cast vpon him. But so both his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>l and fault was the greater, because there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he brought so heauy wrath vpon many. The chasticement that it pleased God to cast on him for it, was part of it for his time: but most of it for the time ensuing. For his time, he was himselfe reprooued: and his state made more troublesome. In the reproofe that was giuen to himselfe, the Lord sheweth, that hee was much for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> this offended: and denounceth heauie iudgements vnto him besides; which should <note place="margin">1 King 11: 11-13</note> afterward come on him and his. In that hee shewed himselfe offended, euen that onely ought to haue beene grieuous enough vnto him, because hee had iustly deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the same. The iudgements that were denounced vnto him, though they were heauy in themselues: yet were they mingled with mercy withall. Heauy they were, that so faire and glorious a Kingdome should now bee rent off, or plucked a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from him: especially, as the consequent there of did shew in the end, or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> things fell out after, so many people being thereby carryed away so great Idolatry, and to most pittifull ruine thereby. They were mingled with mercy, in that he would not doe it in his time; nor take from his line all the whole people neyther: but that was but for <hi>Dauids</hi> sake, for the promise that hee had made vnto him; a figure therein of Iesus Christ, in whom onely it pleaseth God so to spare vs. His estate was made more troublesome, by certaine enemies, and one dangerous Subiect, that it pleased God now (towardes the latter part of his raigne) to raise vp against him: of those Enemies, one in the South among the <hi>Edomites,</hi> the other, in the North among the <note place="margin">Ibid. 14-22 Ibid. 23-25 Ibid. 26-40</note>
               <hi>Syrians; Ieroboam,</hi> one of his owne Officers, beeing that dangerous Subiect wee spake off, to whom the Lord by one of his Prophets, had now already made promise of the greatest part of his Maysters Kingdome. Out of which our selues also may gather, that to keepe in the true seruice of God, preserueth best, both whole states, and priuate men also, from enemies without, and from disloyall and vndutifull members within: and that whensoeuer we faile of our duty therein, then doe we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so let downe thereby our owne good estate in these thinges heere; and that our selues haue giuen the cause, of whatsoeuer such disorder or businesse we finde at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny time to grow vp among vs. That part of the chasticement which was for the time ensuing, was the maine part of that which God threatned vnto him in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe: the diuiding or renting in sunder of that Kingdome of his; and to giue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the greatest part of it vnto his Seruaunt. A manifest token, that the sinne of <hi>Salomon,</hi> though it selfe were not of any long continuance to speake off; yet in the iust iudgementes of God, it deserued the punnishment of many ages: and though himselfe were sooner to goe to his corruption, yet his sinne suruiuing, the punnish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was to haue his course also. As wee in like manner neede not to doubt, but <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> that the renting in sunder of many other Kingdomes and great States, as also of meaner inhaeritances and patrimonies of priuate men, haue beene iustly occasioned by sinne going before; and that no man can so offend God, but that euen then hee worketh the ruine of his owne estate, to him and his for the time ensuing.</p>
            <p n="10">10 As touching <hi>Salomons</hi> death, something we haue very plainely set down: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> but some other left very doubtfull. That which is plainely set downe, is, that when be raigned forty yeares (and so out-liued, and out-raigned his own glory, and found <note place="margin">1 Kings 11: 40-43</note> his estate in his owne time declining, nor mended himselfe on <hi>Ieroboam</hi> who was to succeede him in the greatest part of his Kingdome, but was now fled into <hi>Egypt,</hi> out of his reach) hee then slept with his Fathers, and had his buryall among them: his Son <hi>Rehoboam</hi> raigning in his stead. That which is left doubtfull is, whether before his death, he repented and turned vnto God again, or not: a matter that hath bin in quaestion among the Fathers of old, and so yet is among the learned of these daies also; but such as cannot be cleerely decided by the word of God.

The Story of them leadeth vs to consider, first in what sort they were diuided: then in what case they stoode after that so they were diuided. In what sort they were diuided, doth carry another consideration of such moment with it, that it shall be good for vs, when we haue considred of this diuision of theirs: then to turne our eyes a little aside vnto that other consideration also. In this theyr diuision, we are first to consider, who it was that now succeeded next after <hi>Salomon</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> to raigne ouer that people: then, what dealing passed betwixt the people and him, at this his enterance into his Kingdome. He that succeeded next after <hi>Salomon</hi> in the Kingdome, was <hi>Rehoboam</hi> his Sonne, one and forty yeares old when hee began his <note place="margin">1 King. 11: 43. 14: 21. 2. Chr. 9: 31. 12: 13.</note> raigne, and so borne to his Father about one yeare, before himselfe came to the Kingdome. The dealing that passed betweene the people and him, was all about the diuision wee speake of: eyther of them first hauing some dealing the one with the other; and immediatly after the diuision we speake of breaking in thereuppon. The dealing they had the one with the other, was first of the people with the King: then, of the King with the people againe. That which the people had with the King, was, that they made a petition or suit vnto him, that whereas <hi>Salomon</hi> his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">1. Kin. 12: 1-4. 2. Chr. 10: 1-4.</note> had made their yoake grieuous, it would now please him, to make the grieuous seruitude of his father, &amp; his sore yoak which he put on them, lighter: &amp; that so they would serue him also. The King had dealing twice with the people: first, willing them to depart, and to repaire vnto him againe three daies after; then, afterward gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing his answer vnto them. In willing them for a time to depart, that he might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire <note place="margin">1. King. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

And so in great matters it behoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth all men, especially those that haue their dealing in great affaires (euen in lesse also, as men will serue themselues therein) euer to aduise themselues well, before they answer, and before they fully resolue on that they will doe. Before he gaue his <note place="margin">1. King. 12: 6-11. 2. Chr. 10: 6-11.</note> answer vnto them, he first consulted with others about it: then at the time hee had appointed, he gaue them their answere. He consulted first with the elder sort, who had beene his Fathers Counsellers before: but then soone after, with others besides. The elder sort gaue him aduice, to yeelde something vnto them now, at his first en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try: and so should he euer haue them fast vnto him. Those others that were a yonger company, such as had beene brought vp with him, and wayted on him: whose aduise was to answere them roughly, and roundly to tell them, that he would be more grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous vnto them, than his Father before had beene. When the time appointed came, he gaue them their aunswere: but his answere was, not onely in sense accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <note place="margin">1. Kings. 12: 12-15. 2. Chro. 10: 12-15. 1.

Immediatly vpon this aunswere of his, ten parts of the people did plainely renounce their allegiance vnto him; &amp; when neuerthelesse hee sent his Officer vnto them to gather vp his tribute among them (as making no doubt but stil to retaine them in his allegiance) they in their rage stoning him to death, made it apparant enough thereby, howe resolute and egar they were, in the course that now they were in: and according to this their rebellious departure
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:7530:195"/> now, and this vnkindly diuiding themselues from their bretheren, they euer after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward floode, and neuer vnited themselues to their bretheren againe; the greater part of them going away with the name of them all, and being called the kingdome of <hi>Israell,</hi> the other being called the Kingdome of <hi>Iudah.</hi> That other considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that this Story of their diuision carrieth with it, consisteth of two principall branches: one of instruction; the other, of Doctrine. The instruction that this diuision of theirs doth giue vs, doth much concerne both Princes themselues: and people, too. Princes it teacheth, first for their people, not to impose vpon their Subiects, that which their Subiects generally may thinke to bee greeuous (for the Text doth not shew that <hi>Salomon</hi> had beene ouer greeuous vnto them indeede, but so farre as they were to beare his charges; and he indeede was a magnificall Prince, and yet may seeme otherwise to haue inned the same vnto them againe, euen to the full, when he made Siluer so little esteemed, and in <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> in a manner, as common as the stones of the streetes;) and, if at any time they haue so done, yet that <note place="margin">1. King. 10: 27. 2. Chr. 9: 20.</note> neyther themselues not their successors doe afterward praesume still to gird them in more and more: then, for their owne direction, that they do not easily turne aside from the aduise of such as are experienced and wise, vnto the weaker and greener iudgment of those, that are in such matters but raw; nor from the aduise of those that wish a fauourable care of the people, to those that are such hot-spurres against them. People it teacheth, first not to complaine, vnlesse there be cause: then al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, if there be, yet that they be not so immoderately bent to their owne priuate lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, as that for the safegard of it they sinne against God, in so high a degree as this withdrawing themselues from the allegeance of such as God hath giuen them, and to whom they in duty ought to abide. That other, which is of Doctrine, is, that as immediately after <hi>Salomons</hi> daies his Kingdome was thus rent in sunder, the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> greater part to continuall Idolatry, the other oft-times very much defiled there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with: it ought to be lesse maruell to any (contrary to that perswasion which diuers haue) that the <hi>Gentiles</hi> of the most knowne parts of the world, had no sooner recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the Gospell of Christ our <hi>Salomon</hi> indeede, but that soone after they diuided themseues, most of them to <hi>Mahomet,</hi> the residue also to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and to be much defiled thereby. In what sort they stoode, after that so they were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided, the Story doth in such sort deliuer vnto vs, as that for a good part of it, it selfe doth set it downe vnto vs: but for some part againe it doth often refer vs to such other monuments, as now we haue not extant among vs. What it is that the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry it selfe setteth downe vnto vs, to the ende that we may the better find, I hold it the plainest and readiest way, that wee consider of either of them apart by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues: and first of the Kingdome of <hi>Israell,</hi> that soonest miscarried; then of the Kingdome of <hi>Iudah,</hi> that stoode the longest. As touching the Kingdome of <hi>Israell,</hi> for the better vnderstanding of the estate thereof, it shall be good, first to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider of it but generally: but then to enter into a more speciall consideration of it. Considering of it but generally, first it shall be good to consider of the compasse of time: then, of the estate wherein it stoode. The time that it stoode, was about two hundred fifty and three yeares: or as others do reckon (foure yeares more) two <note place="margin">Punctius. Beroald. Broughton.</note> hundred fifty and seauen yeares. As for the other, wee may easily conceiue that their estate must needes be hard: partly, in respect of diuers good helps that now vnaduisedly they did abandon; and partly, because of certaine disaduantages that afterward befell them all generally. Those good helps that now vnaduisedly they did abandon, were two: one, the Tribe of <hi>Iudah;</hi> the other, the line of <hi>Dauid.</hi> For to both those they knew well enough (and could not bee ignorant) that very speciall promises were made: to the Tribe of <hi>Iudah,</hi> by that Prophesie of <hi>Iacob,</hi> that the Scepter (or a conuenient gouernment, and a tolerable estate thereby) should <note place="margin">Gen. 49: 10.</note> not depart from it, till the promised Sauiour himselfe should come; to the line of <hi>Dauid,</hi> by God himselfe, that he would not abandon it for euer, but that although it should wax and wane as the Moone, yet should it euer stand before him. Those <note place="margin">2. Sa. 7: 14-16 Psal. 89: 28-37</note> disaduantages that befell them all generally, were two likewise: one, that them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues making so little reckoning of the true worship of God, that they claue no fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:7530:195"/> than so, to his Temple and seruice there, they were all soone after drawne to I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry, and so continued so long as they stood; the other, that in the short time <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> that they stood, they had about twenty kinges, and those of eight or nine seuerall families, as plaine a Token as may be conceiued of a troublesome State.</p>
            <p n="2">2 If now we enter into a more speciall consideration of it, it shall not be amisse <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> first to note, that two seuerall times God dealt very effectually with them: once, at the first; another time, about fourescore and ten yeares after, better than the third part of all their time that after they stood. At both which times himselfe appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted such Princes as should raigne ouer them: which he did not (in such manner) at any time else. In both which we are to marke, how little that gracious dealing of God preuailed, both with themselues, and with those that followed. The former of those that God himselfe appointed, was <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> their first King: concerning <note place="margin">Ieroboam,</note> whom, first we are to consider of himselfe; then, of those that did succeed him, till God himselfe did appoint another. With him we finde that God did deale very effectually, both to set him in the right way at the first: and afterward also, as was most meete, when he was wrong. To set him in the right way at the first, hee let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth him vnderstand, why hee so dealt with the line of <hi>Dauid;</hi> and maketh great <note place="margin">1. Kidgs. 11: 29-39.</note> promises to him, if he shall take better heede to his wayes: and doing this before he brought him to the kingdome, euen while <hi>Salomon</hi> himselfe as yet was King, &amp; soone after bringing him to the kingdome indeede, he gaue him assurance enough of the other, if himselfe should do as was required. Dealing with him as was most meete, when he was wrong, we are first to see wherein he was wrong: then, howe God dealt with him thereon. Wrong he was, first in that himselfe tooke no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a course in that his first entrance, being so graciously dealt with as then he was: then also, in that he did not amend it, when afterward he was reproued for it. The course that he tooke in that his first entrance, was, that first setling him-selfe as he thought most meete in his owne kingdome, in two seuerall places, one at <hi>Sichem</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 King. 12 35. <hi>Chr. Adricho.</hi>
               </note> in the South part of his kingdome, on the West of <hi>Iordan;</hi> the other, at <hi>Pennel</hi> in the heart of the other part on the East side of <hi>Iordan</hi> (the vsuall manner of godlesse men, first to gather themselues vnder the protection of their owne wisedome and strength, and then at more leysure to haue their recourse, such as it is, to some kind of dealiug in Religion also:) then cleane contrary to the Law of God, and all sense <note place="margin">1. Kin. 22: 26-30. 32, 33. 1. King 12: 31 13: 33. 34.</note> of reason too, he set vp those two Calues in such sort as he did; and putting away the Leuites, brought in so base a Priest-hood in their roomes. In setting vp those two Calues, the one in <hi>Dan;</hi> the other in <hi>Bethtl,</hi> some things there be common to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> them both: and something peculiar to either of them. Common to them both it was, both the intention and meaning he had therein: and the forme or manner of them. His intention or meaning was, to keepe the people at home within the precincts of his owne kingdome: least that going to <hi>Ierusalem</hi> (thrice in the yeare, as the Law of God required) that Citty being in the other kingdome, the people might so ioyne together againe one time or other, and so defeate him of his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, yea and of his life too, as hee seemed then to feare. God had assured him before, that in the obseruation of his Lawes, should his kingdome be assured vnto him: but, in humaine reason the doubt he conceiued, was in deed very propable or likely; and he destitute of faith, or weake therein, did now giue more credite to that likelyhood in reason, than he did to that other word of God, the performance whereof could not be expected, but onely out of some speciall worke of God to that end directed. And such are the elections of humaine wisedome, euen in the deepest pollicies that are, and in matters of greatest moment. That the Idolatrie that now he erected was of that manner, or the Idols themselues of that forme, it seemeth he rested on that which is a great motiue in the corrupt nature of man, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting on two principall points: one, that their Elders in <hi>Egypt</hi> had beene invred to those before; the other, that the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> time out of mind, had vsed the like, and that they had, of their knoledge while they were with them (til on their behalf God was offended with them) in prosperous estate. Peculiar to either of them it, was that
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:7530:196"/> in those places they were erected; both of thē being places of special note to such a purpose: <hi>Bethel</hi> at least by name, being interpreted to be the house of God; &amp; <hi>Dan,</hi> for that in the time of the Iudges, &amp; (soone after the people came into the Land) by <note place="margin">Iudg. 17: 4, 5. 18: 13-31. <hi>Bibl.

And true it is, that a <hi>Bethel</hi> is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> allotted to the Tribe of <hi>Ephraim,</hi> as it may seeme, by the Text it selfe, where the bounds of that Tribe are named, and the same to be another from <hi>Luz:</hi> which also is plainely set downe by <hi>Cummannus Flinspachius</hi> in his Genealogie of Christ; and not onely such a place attributed to that Tribe, by <hi>Christianus Adrichomins</hi> in <hi>Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tro t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>rra sanctae,</hi> but withall plainly set within the bounds of that Tribe, and noted to be the place, where <hi>Ieroboam</hi> erected the one of his golden Calues. But now the truth is withall, that euen that <hi>Bethel</hi> which was called <hi>Luz,</hi> is by the Text it selfe elsewhere noted to haue beene gotten or gained by the house of <hi>Ioseph:</hi> and to the house of <hi>Ioseph,</hi> it is knowne well enough, there belonged but two Tribes, <hi>Ephraim</hi> and <hi>Manasseh;</hi> of which two, <hi>Ephraim</hi> onely ioyned on <hi>Beniamin,</hi> where that <hi>Bethel</hi> should be (and so are the most likely it belonged to them) whereas both the partes of <hi>Manasses</hi> were elsewhere placed, one, by the other side of <hi>Ephraim</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes the North, the other, much farther off, and on the other side of <hi>Iordan.</hi> So that the same <hi>Bethel</hi> which before was called <hi>Luz,</hi> and which was allotted to the Tribe of <hi>Beniamin,</hi> seemeth to be most likely to be the place (according to the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said iudgement of <hi>Peter Martyr)</hi> where <hi>Ieroboam</hi> placed one of his Idols: which <hi>Adrichomius</hi> also doth grant to be there when he treateth of it, and acknowledgeth <note place="margin">

And then, this being the place, it was not onely of a faire name for the purpose, but indeede <hi>Iacob</hi> had worshipped there many Ages be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and on the comfortable vision that there he had, gaue it the name, calling that place <hi>The house of God:</hi> and so were both places of speciall good note for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of his. Wherein withall it is good to marke, that it is no great matter with the common people, whether the ground of their doings bee good or not, so that they haue some praetense whatsoeuer: the worship that in these places was vsed, yeelding no patronage or warrant at all, vnto this that now was vrged or forced vpon them. In putting away the <hi>Leuites,</hi> and taking in so base a Priesthoode in their roomes, his meaning is plain enough in it selfe: and our own experience teacheth, that we also can hardly abide to haue such a Ministery, as by the word of God will vrge vs farther than <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> our selues do like of; and like rather to haue them of the baser sort, that dare not med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with vs in any of our waies be they neuer so grosse, or that haue no regard there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, than such as were likely to looke into them, and accordingly would deale with vs therein. It seemeth also that Sathan himselfe hath to that end holpen, or put to his hands, and daily yet doth, to abridge the needfull maintenance of the Ministery, otherwise to imploy it to other vses, that so the Ministery might euer be kept so nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and low, as that they should haue neyther heart nor power, to haue any such kind of dealing with vs. Hauing thus farre, wrong made his enterance at the first, the dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling that now the Lord had with him about the same was, that hee did but onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue him for it; but that he did that twice: first, more gently; but afterward, a great deale more roundly. In that wherein hee was but gently reproued, though the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe it selfe was very effectuall, to haue withdrawne him from those his waies so offensiue to God: yet fell there out such an accident immediately after, as, in the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of many, might not a little crosse it againe. So farre foorth as it was effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all to such a purpose, it consisted of two principall partes: one, the message that then was sent him; the other, the mirracle that was done vpon him. And yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, neyther of these came to any great proofe in the end: he growing but an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry at the former; and nothing amended by the latter.

As also we finde by experience with vs, hauing in all ages, especially among our Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lititians or worldly-wise, many that can affoord to their teachers ordinary courtesie, and yet nothing at all regard their Doctrine to their owne amendment: respecting more, yet not of loue, but for their owne credit among men, not to faile in that lesser kind of duty, than in that greater, which by many degrees did more deeply concerne them. The accident that I speake of, which fell out immediatly after, and in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of many, might be able much to crosse this call that they had by the Prophet now, was, that the Prophet neuer came home againe, but was slaine by a Lyon in <note place="margin">1 Kings. 13. 11-32.</note> the way as he returned, and not farre from this Idoll neyther, as also, soone after hee had spoken against it. In whose Story notwithstanding it is good to marke, not onely what many might gather to the hardening of their heartes therein: but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, what better instruction may be gathered on it. To the hardning of their hearts heerein they might gather, that he could neuer prosper, after that hee had spoken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst that deuotion or worship of theirs: or rather, that their God had bin auenged on him for the same. That better instruction that may be gathered thereon, is, first for this matter: then, for some others besides. For this matter, that God indeede diuers times leaueth such stumbling blockes in the way, for those to stumble at that will, and for the exercise of his; but yet withal, sufficiently prouideth for those that are careful: as giuing that power to those Sorcerers of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> to make such Serpents; but yet prouiding that the Serpent of <hi>Moses</hi> should praeuaile against them. So in this like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, both the token that the Prophet gaue before, and the miracle done on the King himselfe, which already were giuen them, might be sufficient: and yet haue they more <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> in that which followed, both in the maner of his death (in that the Lyon neyther tare him, nor pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

For some others besides, that young Prophets, not cleauing fast to the word of God, may som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times be deceiued by the old: and that it is dangerous to credit any report of any ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parition of Angels, otherwise teaching, than God himselfe hath taught vs already. In that wherein he was more roundly dealt with, first he was (as it were) no more; but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reproued: but, a good while after, punished also. While he was but onely reproo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, most of the Story doth appertaine to that matter onely: but in one part of it we may learn another lesson besides. That which appertaineth to that matter only, is, how sharply he was reproued: and how plainly himselfe might see that it was of God. His reproofe now was a plain and resolute denouncing of very heauy iudgments, against him and his: to the vtter ouerthrow of his owne house for euer; and to the great af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictiō <note place="margin">1 King. 14. 6. 16. 1.

Kings. 16: 11-13. 15-20.</note> according to the word of the Lord, he made an vtter destruction of them, both of his Kindred, and of his Friendes. But then the people setting vp another against him, besiedging the Citty and taking it; hee also desperatelie set Fire on the Pallace wherein himselfe was, and so eestroyed both it and himselfe withall: the Lorde so ordering the matter, that for his good liking of <hi>Ieroboams</hi> Calues, for his trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and these his Murthers, hee was himselfe his owne Executioner after a strange and fearefull manner. <hi>Tibni,</hi> it seemeth, came to the Kingdome without any bad <note place="margin">Tibni.</note> practice at all, chosen by the people that were at home: but they then hauing warre <note place="margin">1. Kings. 16: 21, 22.</note> abroad, another was chosen by the Army. Albeit therefore, that this man also stood as King (at least, as one of the two) for foure yeares: yet haue wee no Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of him, neyther good nor bad; the other, as it seemeth, going away with all the Story of raigning as King, as in his Story wee are more plainely to see. Hee therefore that was set vppe by the Army, was <hi>Omri,</hi> the Generall of the fielde in <note place="margin">Omri.</note> that peece of seruice, and hee that afterward remooued the Seate of his Kingdome to <hi>Samaria,</hi> where afterward it stood, so long as the Kingdome it selfe continued. <note place="margin">1. King. 16: 16, 17, 23.</note> So now, as touching these, we are first to consider of <hi>Omri</hi> himselfe: then, of those others that did succeed him, till it pleased God himselfe to appoint another. As tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching <hi>Omri</hi> himselfe, we are first likewise to consider of the materiall part of his Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: and then of the time of his raigne besides. The materiall part of his story, is, first, as touching one speciall action of his: than, as touching all his whole carriage generally. That one specially action of his was, that the Pallace at <hi>Tirzah</hi> beeing <note place="margin">1. Kings. 16: 24-28. 1. King. 16: 23</note> destroyed, though himselfe neuerthelesse made his most aboad there, for six yeares after: yet some-time in the meane season it seemeth, hee compassed the other; and so, after the first sixe yeares shifted the Seate of his Kingdome from <hi>Tirza,</hi> where it was before, to <hi>Samaria</hi> where it was after, calling it after the Name of him of whome hee bought it. His whole carryage towardes GOD, is noted to haue <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> beene very ill, and worse than all that were before him: and the matter was, for that he was so giuen to those wayes of <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> the corruption of Religion which he erected. A matter so much the worthyer of marking, for that it seemeth, that it was but his great religiousnesse that way, that GOD so much misliketh (and then, the more Popish, may bee in like sort so much the more odious:) otherwise not seeming so bad as others (for any thing that is deliuered vnto vs of him (both
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:7530:198"/> for that he came not to the Crowne by blood as others did, but aduaunced thereunto by the Army; and because wee haue certaine tokens of some good moderation in him. For neither did he oppresse or so much as vrged any of his Nobles, or people to get any house of theirs from them: neither did hee slip into that common vanity <note place="margin">Psal. 49: 11. 1. King. 16: 23.</note> of the world, to impose his name on that building of his. As touching the time of his raigne, it is plainely set downe, that he raigned twelue yeares: and if we lay those twelue yeares of his, to the time when first hee was made King of the Army, and to <note place="margin">Ibid. 15, 16. Ibid. 23.</note> that which is said of him againe in the one and thirtieth yeare <hi>Asa,</hi> so shall wee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, that foure yeares at the first he did not raigne by himselfe alone, but with <hi>Tib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni</hi> also, and the other eight yeares onely alone. For when first they made him King, it is plainely saide, that <hi>Zimri</hi> began his seauen-daies-Kingdome, in the seauen and twentieth yeare of <hi>Asa</hi> King of <hi>Iudah:</hi> and soone after, that the same day the host <note place="margin">1. King. 16: 15. Ibid. 16.</note> heard of it, they made their own Generall King; and withall speeded them so fast against <hi>Zimri,</hi> that they got him downe at the seauen daies end. So may wee see, <note place="margin">Ibid. 17, 18.</note> that he also first began in the seauen and twentieth yeare of <hi>Asa,</hi> aswell as <hi>Zimri:</hi> and that there were very few daies, if any at all, betwixt the beginning of the one and the other; when as it might very well be, either the selfe same day, or the next. In the one and thirtieth yeare of <hi>Asa</hi> it is said likewise, that <hi>Omri</hi> then began to raigne o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer <hi>Israell:</hi> which if we vnderstand of his raiging alone, so haue we his twelu yeares <note place="margin">Ibid. 23.</note> fully accomplished, by those foure with <hi>Tibni,</hi> and eight by himselfe.

That sonne of his was <hi>Ahab,</hi> whose <note place="margin">Ahab.</note> Story is much more large, than any of the others that yet we haue had: and yet the effect of all is but this, that he was very offensiue to God; and that God dealt accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly <note place="margin">1.

When he did but chastice him for it, we are then to see, what his offence was: and how it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed God to chastice him for it. His offence was such, that he is noted to haue done worse, than any of those that were before him: and that to haue beene, because hee <note place="margin">Ibid. 30-33.</note> did not onely walke in the waies of <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> as others of his praedecessors before; but because he had so corruptly married, and thereby had fallen to much Idolatry be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides.

               </gap> Lord had sent him vnto him; but euen abruptly, as it were, and bluntly enough, telling the King, that as the Lord God of <hi>Israell</hi> liued before whom he stood, there should be neyther Dew nor Raine fot those yeares en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing, but according to his word. Iesus also the Sonne of <hi>Sirach</hi> goeth no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <note place="margin">Eccles 48: 3.</note> but onely that he did shut vp heauen, &amp; by the word of the Lord: but else-where we haue, that it was doone by earnest prayer. But to go no farther than this praesent <note place="margin">Iam. 5: 17.</note> place giueth occasion, the greatest personages that are, euen Kings withall, must bee content somtime to be so dealt withall by the Seruants of God, as, out of which they may easily take offence, as not being dealt with in such good manner, one way or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as appertained: especially now, since the time that Christ is come among vs, and hath shewed vs all; neyther denouncing before when it pleaseth him to strike, nor shewing why it should bee needfull now, but euery one for himselfe to heede his wayes as hee will bee serued, and neuer to looke for it, now to bee taught or warned still. According to which word of the Prophet, God, first prouiding for that his Seruaunt, sent indeede a maruellous great drought, and of long continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance on all that Land, to the great distresse thereof. For the Prophet hee first pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided, before the Famine by that great drought did begin: but then againe, when <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> the Famine was sore vpon them. Before it beganne, God appointed the Prophet to <note place="margin">1. Kin. 17▪ 2. 6.</note> go and hide him by the Riuer <hi>Cherish,</hi> arising in the West, and running Eastward in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Iordan:</hi> that so hee might euer as neede should be drink of the Riuer, and telling him farther, that he had already commaunded the Rauens to feede him there. Which when the Prophet accordingly did, he plainely found the good hand of God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended towardes him to his good, both in gracious and wonderfull manner, the Rauens, that hardly finde oft-times enough for themselues, bringing him both Bread and Flesh, euery day, both Morning and Euening, wherein wee may note, not onely that vsuall worke of God, euer setting his in safety, before hee poure foorth his wrath on the wicked: but that at this time besides, hee would haue the Prophet to hide him there, that so those that made so light on the word of God before, should not now bee able to get to the Prophet, though neuer so faine (after their manner) they would. Another thing also might some (to good vse) gather heereof, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, such as for gaining time to theyr study, would, if it might stand with theyr health, haue but one meale a-day: besides that Phisicke accounteth that to bee the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of good health by decaying the stomacke; seeing God himselfe, in so great a famine, allowed his Seruaunt two meales a day, it may stand in such like case for a rule vnto others. When the drought was now so great, that the Riuer it selfe was <note place="margin">1. Kings. 17: 7-16.</note> dryed, for that no raine fell on the earth, God then prouided otherwise for him, with a poore Widdow in the Coasts of <hi>Zidon,</hi> and so but a <hi>Gentile,</hi> and none of the <hi>Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites.</hi> A strange worke of God, to ouer-hippe all in <hi>Israel,</hi> and send his Seruant forth to the <hi>Gentiles:</hi> and, being so full handed himselfe, yet not to relieue so special a Seruant of his, but out of such penury as hee did, and that among straungers too. The Widdow being a Stranger, might in reason some-thing haue staggered at <hi>Elias</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ibid. 17-24.</note> his demand to be partner with her and her Son, of that little store that then she had; and to serue him first too: but obeying therein, she is farther tryed in her Sonne, and farther acquainted with the power and glory of God. And if any of vs would <note place="margin">Ibid. 21.</note> gladly raise others, in such sort as to vs appertaineth, from errour to truth, or from loosenesse of life to some amendment, hence might we learne, how carefully to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply our selues vnto them, and withall to seeke vnto God, if we would praeuaile there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:7530:199"/> Hauing thus prouided for his Seruant, the drought was now so great, that in <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maria,</hi>

For both the Lorde had willed him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to hide himselfe: and when <hi>Ahab</hi> had found him againe, hee was so farre from doing him any hurt, that very farre hee was ruled by him. So it may seeme rather to be, that <hi>Elias</hi> did not keepe himselfe secret, as for feare of the King, but that they might be truly humbled by that chasticement, before that he would be found of them againe, to ease them of it; and that <hi>Ahab</hi> did not so inquire for him to haue his life, or any way to hurt him (which may rather seeme hee durst not, hee saw the power of God so present with him, by that his prediction before;) but rather that hee would haue had him, to see if hee could haue obtained release of that chasticement, as the Prophet indeede had told him, that they should haue neyther Dew nor Raine, but according as himselfe should say the word. The other of <hi>Iezabell,</hi> is, that whereas she slew many of the Prophets of the Lord (the particular of which Story we haue <note place="margin">Ibid. 18: 4, 13.</note> not) it may very well bee, that it was most for this famine too: as eyther themselues refusing to helpe them, being so distressed as they were, or concealing <hi>Elias</hi> among them (for so did <hi>Nebucadnezzer</hi> after, rage against the Wise-men of <hi>Babylon;</hi> and <note place="margin">Dan. 2: 12, 13</note> in such cases, such is the impaciency of godlesse persons;) or else, as being the chiefe and principall causes of all that their misery, as Christians were charged by many of the persecuting Emperours since, and by much of their people besides. When this chasticement of theirs was to be taken off from them, first wee are to consider of it: then, of another accident that fell out thereupon. As touching it, when the Lord <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
               <note place="margin">1.

Those thinges that passed before, were some of them, but with some few seuerall persons: others, with many. Those fewe seuerall persons were but two: <hi>Obadiah;</hi> and <hi>Ahab. Obadiah</hi> was the man who <note place="margin">Ibid. 2, 7-16.</note> first light on the Prophet, and as he was comming to shew himselfe vnto <hi>Ahab:</hi> and the businesse that the Prophet had with him, was, but that he willed him to goe and shew <hi>Achab</hi> that he was there (and so it appeareth the Prophet himselfe did not goe, but onely sent by <hi>Obadiah:</hi> both a performance no doubt of Gods commaundement, willing to goe shew himselfe vnto <hi>Achab;</hi> and yet not letting down therein the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of his function, in such place as it pleased God then to vse him) which though at the first he did not obtaine, on some feare that was thereon conceiued, yet soone af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it was with good will performed. With <hi>Achab</hi> he had some businesse also, both at their first meeting: and about the businesse they had in hand. At their first mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, <note place="margin">Ibid. 17.</note>
               <hi>Achab</hi> tooke on him something like a King, as hee was: in effect charging the <note place="margin">Ibid. 18.</note> Prophet, that he it was that troubled <hi>Israell.</hi> But the Prophet plainely told him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, it was not he, but that it was euen himselfe, and his Fathers house, in that they had forsaken the commaundements of the Lord: and that, for his part, hee had fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed <hi>Baalim</hi> besides, so defiling himselfe with much more Idolatry than his fathers had done. In that the King did so charge him, we are not to conceiue, that he did it against his owne conscience or iudgement therein, though the Prophet were as
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:7530:199"/> free from it as might be: but that it is a naturall perswasion in vs all generally, that we may sufficiently serue GOD, and the Worlde too, and therefore, that they are too praecife, and troublers of publike peace, that will not allow vs both in our profession and life, to be some-thing like to others about vs. And the aunswere of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet on the other side teacheth, both him and vs, that wee cannot any way decline from the word of God to gratify others, or to make our selues, or our waies sutable to them, but that therein wee trouble our owne estate, not onely priuate men but Princes too, euery of vs in our owne proper measure. About the businesse they had <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> in hand, the Prophet propoundeth a course to the King, how to grow to some good yssue: and the King ioyneth with him therein. The course was, that the King should <note place="margin">Ibid 19.</note> send and gather together vnto the Prophet in Mount <hi>Carmell,</hi> all the people general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: and together with them, all the Prophets of <hi>Baal,</hi> foure hundred and fifty; and the Prophets of the Groues, whom <hi>Iezebell</hi> maintained, foure hundred also. Which the King readily did: not referring the matter to his Counsell, who were like enough <note place="margin">Ibid. 20.</note> to haue beene such (at least, for diuers of them) as would haue crossed it one way or other, though it had beene for none other cause, but onely to haue brunted the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, that he should not haue that interest in the King, or so farre meddle, as the ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering of so great assembly to him, might diuersly import; but by and by satisfying the Prophet therein. Those beeing now gathered together, the Prophet hath to deale with many: both with all the people generally, and with those other Prophets; and that hee dooth twice. His former dealing with them, was, to propound vnto them some indifferent course, whereby to make tryall of themselues, in what case they stood towardes God, or whether they were, in that respect, right or wrong. Which course of his, was no sooner propounded, but that it was liked of all gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally; and soone after effected too: but what it was, is not so fully described vnto vs, but that some part of it we may easilie mistake, vnlesse we take the beeter heede. He required <hi>Ahab,</hi> in distinct and plaine tearmes, to send for two sortes of Prophets: <note place="margin">Ibid. 19.</note> foure hundred and fifty of <hi>Baals;</hi> and four hundred of the Groue, or, as it is interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of the groues, otherwise also noting them to haue their diet then at <hi>Iezebels</hi> table. <note place="margin">Ibid. 20:</note> It is said likewise of <hi>Ahab,</hi> that besides that he sent for the people, hee gathered the Prophets together: not noting that he gathered all; nor yet, on the other side, that he left out any. But now when <hi>Elias</hi> is to deale with the people about that matter, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dooth hee charge them with any other matter, but onely with a doubtfull and mingled worshipping, parted, as it were, betwixt the Lord and <hi>Baal.</hi> Now the Lord, with him, was out of quaestion: and <hi>Baal</hi> onely the party impugned. So that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he first required the Prophets of the Groues too, those that did eate at <hi>Ieze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels</hi> Table: yet haue we no mention, but onely of those Prophets of <hi>Baal,</hi> in all that followeth. Out of which some haue gathered, that those others the King would not bring hither, and that <hi>Iezebell</hi> woulde not suffer them to come: a matter <note place="margin">Conr. Pell. Pet. Martyr.</note> indeede likely enough; but wee haue no certainty of it. It may bee therefore, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> that they were there too: but that the Prophet doth not so roundly oppose himselfe against them, as he doth against the others, as not accounting these so hurtfull: and yet that he would haue them there with the others, as in diuers good respectes hee might. And this were likely to stand the more cleere, if it may bee found, that the Prophets of the Groue, or of the Groues, were not so Idolatrous as the others: and that may seeme, may well be gathered; though it be not, that I doe know of, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by any. For those Groues were not common Woods, or hoults of Trees, but eyther specially chosen, or purposely set about some place, where the people eyther <note place="margin">

First there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as touching the higher ground, it is the generall inclination of all, that as any thing is of more price and dignity with vs, if by such kinde of placing wee can adde any beauty vnto it (or if it bee no more but the contentment of our owne mindes therein) wee readily affoorde it that aduantage; and th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

Then as touching the Groue to be added thereto, that also is in the common iudgement of all, a comely and a pleasant ornament vnto it: and of good vse besides, both in the hotter Countries for shade, and in the colder, for wind and weather.

This then being the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall liking of all, it must needes be graunted, both that it is a ready course for all men generally to incline vnto: and that easily it breedeth dislike of others that any way crosse it, as doing it rather of meere peeuishnesse, than of any reason to beare them <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> out in it. The word of God, giuen vnto them, was against both: and it might ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well bee, that euen in those thinges also hee would haue his people sundred from <note place="margin">Exod. 20: 26.

And in these places it is very cleere, that among them the Lord onely was worshipped: but after that himselfe appointed what should be the place of his worship, and forbad all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers <note place="margin">1. Sa. 9: 12-14, 19, 23. 1. Chr. 16: 39. 2. Chr. 1: 3.</note> besides, then could not these be to that end vsed. Againe it is certaine, that many of them were vsed to Idolatry, both before this people came into the Land, and by themselues afterwardes also. But as yet it may probably seeme, that as where the golden Calues were, yet there also they professed no worship but onely of the Lord: so might it bee in their Groues and high places also; this King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe being the first (to speake off) that brought in that other Idolatry beside. So it seemeth to me, not to be vnlikely, but that those other Prophets of the Groues, did professe the worship of the Lord, though but in corrupt manner, and so might more easily bee borne-with: and yet that there were of them Idolaters also, rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants of the old <hi>Canaanites;</hi> though the Lorde was their onely God, were yet so fresh in the memory, &amp; in the assurance of all generally, that the most of them may probably be thought to be of the other. That those did eate at <hi>Iezebels</hi> Table, or were maintained by her, may seeme to import otherwise, as that they were not like to find such fauour with her, if they were none other than so: but shee being wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into that Land, where it was so firmly on all handes held, that the Lord God of <hi>Israell</hi> was their onely Lord, it may probably be conceiued, that shee was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to professe him also; at least being left to her liberty for the manner of it, to follow the guise that most was vsed. And so it may be, that these also were of the number: and yet that <hi>Elias</hi> on good consideration (though hee required to haue them there, and like enough that <hi>Achab</hi> was content to satisfie him to the full, as his case stoode then) thought not good in such sort to proceede against them, as he did against the others. Then falleth it out, that now the businesse is but against <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> the Idolatry of <hi>Baal,</hi> and against the practicers and teachers of it: and not (in the course that now is intended) against any of those others besides. The thing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that he opposeth himselfe against, being the Idolatry of <hi>Baal</hi> that they were <note place="margin">1. King. 18: 21</note> in, and labouring to draw them out of it, first hee reprooueth them for their incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from the Lord to <hi>Baal</hi> so much as they did, and tearming it halting betwixt both: then, when the people are silent, as hauing nothing that they may iustly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leage in their defence, he propoundeth that course vnto them that we speake of for <note place="margin">Ibid. 22-24.</note> the triall of the matter in quaestion; &amp; the people thought it so very indifferent, &amp; so good a triall withal, that generally they accepted of it. Setting in hand therfore with their triall, &amp; <hi>Baals</hi> Prophets hauing the fore part of the day to work in, and there in <note place="margin">Ibid. 25-39.</note> great measure too, earnestly endeuouring, but nothing praeuailing: when the turne
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:7530:200"/> came to <hi>Elias,</hi> he quickly dispatched, to the great contentment &amp; admiration of al. This being his former dealing, both with the people, and with those foure hunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and fifty Prophets of <hi>Baal,</hi> his next was, for the execution of those false Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, <note place="margin">Ibid. 40.</note> willing the people, that they suffered not one of them to escape, and the people readily yeelding their helpe and seruice therein: so that at the bottome of the hill by the side of the Riuer <hi>Kison,</hi> they were all by <hi>Elias</hi> and the people there put to death; the King himselfe nothing at all hindering that Iustice, that there we read of, but as it may seeme by a circumstance soone after following, hauing the Prophet then in speciall fauour. One there is, who is of opinion, that those other foure hundred Prophets of the Groues, were then and there executed likewise: but I do not see that he hath, in the Text, any warrant for it; and others there bee, as <note place="margin">

This execution first being done, and the time being now come, that the promised raine was to be giuen them, the Prophet first desireth the King now to go and refresh himselfe (hauing it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth fasted till then) assuring him, there was good store of raine now verie neere: but himselfe goeth aside to pray, and so continueth till hee saw that he had obtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. By which time the King hauing refreshed himselfe, is now by the Prophet <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> aduised, to speede himselfe home so fast as he can, least he be stayed by rayne: and himselfe attending the King home, made such speed withall, that he euer kept with the kings Chariot, and came to <hi>Iezrael</hi> some-what before. Whereby it seemeth, that the King bare him such countenance then, that the Prophet conceyued good hope of more good to be done vpon him: and thereon attended so as he did.</p>
            <p n="5">5 That other accident that fell out heereuppon, was cleane contrary, as it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> to that the Prophet had before conceyued, being no sooner come to <hi>Iesrael,</hi> hauing attended the king thither, but that he findeth himselfe as it were closed vp in the iawes of death, vnlesse he see to himselfe in time: a great discomfiture to him for the time; but quickly comforted againe of God. His discomfiture was such, as presented vnto him present death the next day, vnlesse he could vse some meanes to auoide it before: whereupon he shifted for himselfe so well as hee could. The danger therefore that he was in, being to bee considered, first, it is good to note, that together with the danger it selfe, God so ordered the matter, that withall he had a way to escape. The danger it selfe, was, that <hi>Ahab,</hi> when he was teturned, <note place="margin">1. King. 19: 1.</note> telling Queene <hi>Iezebel,</hi> how things that day had passed (as it is the manner of men to do, especially when the things are strange withall) that godlesse Queene so lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle regarded the great glory of God shining therein, that she presently determined with her-selfe, to haue his life for it, the next day following. The way that he had withall to escape, was, that the Queene her selfe coulde not keepe in the bloudy purpose she had conceyued, but plainly sent him word thereof: accounting belike, that now she had him sure enough; and not contented, it seemeth, onely to haue <note place="margin">Ibid. 2.</note> his life, but that also she would torment him with the feare of death in the meane season. The shift that then he made for himselfe was by flight: and the same in good sort by him performed. That he must saue himselfe by flight, it is somwhat strange, both in respect of his late good deserts; and of that extraordinary power wherewith he was diuersly endowed: but so God vseth to humble his, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing whatsoeuer benefite it hath pleased God to make to redound to others <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> thereby; or whatsoeuer power he hath otherwise giuen vnto them. That it was in good sort by him performed, we may perceiue plainely enough by that which wee haue recorded of him therein; and yet haue we one likely-hood that doth seem to shew it farther. That which we haue recorded of him therein, is, that hee made his flight by <hi>Iudah:</hi> and that then he tooke into the wildernesse so farre as hee did. That hee made his flight by <hi>Iudah,</hi> it appeareth, because hee came from <hi>Iesrael</hi> to <note place="margin">Ibid 3.</note>
               <hi>Beersheba,</hi> in the out-most Coast of <hi>Iudah</hi> South-ward. Where it is noted, that he left his seruant, but not declared withall, whereuppon he did it: and yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing because it is recorded heere, it seemeth to haue some dependance on this story, and that I cannot finde that it hath, vnlesse it bee in one of these two: that
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:7530:201"/> either he left him behinde in pollicy for a time; or else parted with him cleane, as not so fit for him as he did neede. For as touching that conceit of some, that this his seruant should be that child of the Widdow with whom he soiourned, to whom at his intercession God had giuen life againe, and that the same was likewise <hi>Ionas</hi> the Prophet, because it is but their owne conceit, &amp; altogether without any ground on the Text, we are therefore to leaue it where it is. Hee might leaue him behind in policy, if either <hi>Iezebel</hi> did indeede, by any such meanes as she could vse, pursue him thither (a matter both possible, and not vnlikely) or if the Prophet but doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted she had: or otherwise found, when he came thither, that there he was in danger also. For so leauing his man in sight, and, as it were, going about his Maisters bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse there, it might seeme to imply, that himselfe was there also. And <hi>Ieza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel,</hi> being so bloody a woman as she was, and so wickedly bent against the Prophets of the Lord, hauing destroyed so many of them before, being armed also with so great Authority, and hauing bound her selfe with an Oath to the slaughter of this man of whom we speake: was not vnlikely to haue laid for him euen at <hi>Bethshabee</hi> also, by such meanes as she might easily haue thereunto. But if that particle <hi>there,</hi> may, by the vse of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> tongue, bee vnderstoode of that other place from whence he fled (as Relatiues, with them, are diuers times vsed) then had the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet iuster occasion a great deale, to make the best shift that he could for his owne escape: especially, when his Seruaunt so left, should bee in no danger thereby, the quarrell being but personall onely, &amp; himselfe being the onely man against whom <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> it was. Hee might also leaue him behind, to part with him cleane, as not so meete for him as he did neede, for that we do not find that they met againe, and soone af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it followeth, that <hi>Elizeus</hi> is by God himselfe mentioned vnto him, and that hee <note place="margin">1. Kings. 19. 16, 21.</note> did Minister vnto him, or did him seruice: as also it is reported by one of the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants of the King of <hi>Israell,</hi> after the death of <hi>Elias,</hi> that <hi>Eliseus</hi> the Prophet then, was the seruant of <hi>Elias</hi> before. And true it is, that the neerer that any approocheth <note place="margin">2. King. 3. 11.</note> vnto the waies of God indeede, the harder is it, for any such to light on such Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, as are meete for them: not one to bee had among many mo than one would thinke at the first, but will either condemne of morosity his Maisters integrity, and thereupon hang off from him againe: or else seeing it to bee but a barren seruice in worldly respects, thereupon hang impatiently on them for the time they tarry, so long as they see not, otherwise how to better themselues; and when they do, or but perswade themselues then readily take the opportunity offered, yea and themselues force it too rather then faile. At the first a man would thinke, it were no matter of any such difficulty: but had not God himselfe prouided that seruant for him that then he did, and such an one as himselfe should bee a Prophet after; no doubt it would haue beene a hard matter for <hi>Elias</hi> to haue gotten one fit for his purpose. And the greater the Prophet himselfe is, though the seruant may be in guifts infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior by so many degrees, that therein there may bee no comparision at all betwixt them: yet in orderly carriage, and good moderation to his affections, the neerer had the seruant neede to come vnto him; otherwise, the farther hee is off therein, the more troublesome must he needes be vnto him, and therefore so much the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meeter for him. Howsoeuer it was that now he parted with his seruant, hee then sped himselfe farther, euen one daies iourney into the Wildernes, before he rested: <note place="margin">1. King. 19: 4</note> and so got himselfe reasonable safe (to the iudgement of any) from the danger that then he was in. But a strange sight in some respect it was, that so notable a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet as he, so very lately so much honoured from aboue, so benificiall and welcome to the whole land beneath, should now notwithstanding bee in that feare among them, that he rather chose to flee to Serpents, and the sauage beasts of the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, than to abide among his owne people, though all of them now, in most fresh memory, very deepely indebted vnto him. A true and right patterne of this prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent vnthankfull and ill world: often bearing it selfe hardest against those▪ that haue best deserued of it. That one likelihood that we haue which farther sheweth vs, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> that whereas <hi>Elias</hi> was to saue himselfe by flight, he did the same effectually, is, that being so come into the Wildernesse, himselfe, being in speciall anguish, neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:7530:201"/> fell so soone asleepe; and that GOD so soone did feede him there: the one branch thereof importing, that he had trauelled very sore; the other, that hee had not any where stayed, so much as to take him any meate. Because the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, it seemeth, was fasting, till they had done their businesse at <hi>Carmel,</hi> it is most likely that the Prophet was so too: but when he thereupon wished the King to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare no longer, but to go and refresh himselfe, he notwithstanding went then to Prayer, and persisted therein, till he perceyued hee had obtained. Then wishing the King to speede himselfe homeward, himselfe hastened thither also: there, it may seeme, thinking to haue had opportunity to haue refreshed himselfe at leisure. He is no sooner come thither, but that he findeth, there is no staying at all for him there. Speeding himselfe thence, his iourney was great; and seeing hee was so soone sed by God himselfe, when he was come to his iourneyes end, that is it that may seeme to import, that he made no stay by the way: a kind of exercise or triall, that others also of the children of God must looke sometimes to be put vnto; and for that cause are to arme themselues before hand for it. His discomfiture heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note place="margin">1. King. 19: 4</note> being so great, that he besought the Lord he might dye (so heauy a burthen is it oft-times, euen for those that are best endued, quietly to beare, the great vnthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse that the world for the most part yeeldeth) now are we to see, how it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed God to deale with him thereon: first in that place where now hee was; then, else-where, a little after. In that place where now he was, it pleased God in that his distresse, to minister much comfort vnto him: in one thing very plainly; and it seemeth, that in another he had the same meaning also. That one thing wherein it was plaine, was not onely for that present: but for many dayes after ensuing. For that present it was, that God did shew himselfe to take such care on his behalf, <note place="margin">Ibid. 5▪7.</note> as to send him foode in that his necessity: and that hee did it, both so plentifully, that it serued him twice; and that he did it by the ministery of an Angell. In that which was for many dayes after ensuing, wee are to consider, not onely what the thing it selfe was: but also, of another thereof depending. The thing it selfe was, that his body was sustained by those two refections forty dayes, and forty nights: a great experiment, and a great number of witnesses of many dayes, of the great <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> and speciall fauour of God towards him, myraculously, by his extraordinary dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with him, preseruing his good estate so long, not onely in speciall great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to himselfe; but also to his great honour in all ages with others. Wherein likewise we may farther note, as on Gods behalfe the variety of his working, in that place feeding the Prophet, with those two meales forty daies, where hee fed the people before forty years, euery day giuing them their meate afresh vnto them, the Sabaoths onely still excepted: so on the behalfe of <hi>Elias</hi> also, though he were a great Prophet, yet that vnlesse his businesse were the greater there, hee was much beholding to God that so maintained him in that wildernesse, if hee all that time were but walking the wanderings, or kept close in the couertures of his owne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity. That other that dependeth thereon, is, that we do not read, that any of the godlyer sort of the people of God ensuing, did euer take vp among them any imitation of this myraculous fast of <hi>Elias:</hi> that vsage of theirs implying, that it was not of nccessity, that any should afterward imitate such another that followed in Christ. That other wherein it is likely that so it was also, is, that then the Angell <note place="margin">Ibid. 7.</note> told him, that there was much way abiding him yet: not so much respecting there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, as it seemeth to me, that his iournying to <hi>Horeb,</hi> which notwithstanding follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed immediately after; as framed rather to be an answere vnto him, for that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired a little before, that he might dye, giuing him now to vnderstand, that hee might not looke to go yet, but had to returne to his labour againe, as hauing much to do, before he might thinke to giue ouer. For neither doth the Angel bid him go to <hi>Horeb;</hi> neither was it of any such distance by far, as to require so long a time thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (the way from <hi>Horeb</hi> to <hi>Kadesh-barnea,</hi> being almost as far as the other, &amp; that being but 11. dayes iourny:) and when he was there, God did ask him twice▪ what <note place="margin">

               <hi>Iezebel,</hi> heereby he is giuen to vnderstand, that as yet he was in no such daunger. In that other place wherein God had farther dealing with him, we are first to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, of his going thither: then, what dealing it was, that God had with him there. As touching the former of these, wee haue it not expressed in what sort he came thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: but conceiued by one, as, for feare of <hi>Iezebel,</hi> fleeing away from his calling. <note place="margin">Pet. Martyr.</note> But seeing we doe not reade of any farther calling hee had, than that which hee hath <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> as yet performed, and seeing that, as his case was (so farre as wee are able to charge him by the Text) it seemeth to be cleere, that he might flee: I doe not see how hee may be iustly charged, by this his flight to forsake his calling, or that he did any more therein than was lawfull for him to do. But now that in the Wildernesse he had so good experience of the prouidence of God towards him, being so readily refreshed, and serued therein with an Angell from heauen; hauing likewise such wordes vttered vnto him, as out of which he might as readily conceiue, that yet he had much time to spend (that being the matter whereof he stoode in doubt now) as that he had some long iourney to go (that being not otherwise spoken of yet) I, for my part, doe not see, but that heerein (for any thing we haue in the Text to the contrary) hee might be led much by his owne infirmity, in this his iournying vnto <hi>Horeb:</hi> not onely, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it was so farre out of the way from that which was likeliest to be his businesse, if any way he had to deale with the people of God as he had begun, and because we do not reade of any direction at all of going thither; but much rather, both because when he was come thither, God asked him twice what hee did there, and because it was so long before he came thither. For if God had commaunded him thither, it is not likely that he would so haue asked him what hee did there: and seeing it was so long before he came there, which by likelihood he might well haue done in one quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of that time or neere vnto it, it seemeth he had no set iourney thither; but that he kept himselfe in the Wildernesse to auoyd that former danger, and by that occasion the rather went vnto <hi>Horeb.</hi> For not onely the more idle, and the lighter sort of the people, are giuen to see places of speciall note: but sometimes euen the wisest and best men that are, as either neede at any time requireth, or as opportunities are offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto them. That therefore being a place of so speciall a note, by the giuing of the Law, and that gracious conuersing of God with <hi>Moses</hi> there, it may well bee, that in that respect he rather chose to go thither (if hee thought it needfull, as it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth <note place="margin">Deut. 4: 10, 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="6">6 Being come thither, first God dealt with him, about that his comming thither: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> and then employed him farther besides. About that his comming thither, his dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling tendeth to his instruction onely, as it seemeth to me, though he did no more in effect, but onely aske him what he did there: but that he did not onely at the first so soone as he came; but afterward also, when it seemeth he did prepare him to some better aduisement in that his answere. When first he asked him what he did there, <note place="margin">1. Kin. 19: 8, 9.</note> it was as that time sufficient to put him in minde, that vnlesse he had some iust occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of that his being there, he was without defence or warrant therein. Many of vs haue in like sort had and yet haue our wandrings too, some of trauaile as we terme it, to see the estate and manners of strange peoples, others in the way of deuotion to visit places of special note; of al which, though there may be some vse, somtimes need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, sometimes but tollerable; yet in thē all this question to him is of special moment for vs, to occasion or driue vs, by comparing together what we do there, and what we haue elsewhere to do, to aduise our selues well, whether we be right or not. When it seemeth God did prepare him to some better answere, we are to see, in what sort he did it: and how farre it may seeme to haue preuayled with the Prophet. The better to finde in what sort he did it, whereas, if that be his meaning, as it seemeth to me to be, such things as follow must haue relation to his answere going before we are first to
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:7530:202"/> consider of that his aunswere: then, what course is taken for the framing of it to some better order. In that his aunswere, it seemeth, his meaning was, that hee had occasion to flee; and so was fled thyther: else I see not how hee made any dyrect aunswere to the matter demaunded; but beeing so taken, it is playne that hee hath directly aunswered. But now whereas there bee two speciall braunches of that his aunswere, the former of them onely hee further confirmeth, or dooth shew some reason for it: and sayeth nothing of the other, but seemeth to leaue it as onely im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> The former of them is, that hee had occasion to flee: for which though he shew very good reason; yet doth hee altogether omit that, which seemeth to bee most in quaestion now. The reason that hee bringeth in, consisteth of two princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall <note place="margin">Ibid. 10.</note> partes: one, that his zeale was such towardes the Lord, that hee could not abide to see such things as of late had passed among the Children of Israell; the other, that they sought his life besides. The former of which his Father expresseth: complay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that they had not onely forsaken his Couenant, but that still they so persisted in that their apostacy, that they had also broken downe his Altars, and so farre de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed all his Prophets, that he onely now remained. That they brake downe his Altars, and made such hauocke of his Prophets, it may seeme their meaning was, vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly to abolish the memory of that his Couenant, and to leaue none among them that might renew it vnto them againe. That which he omitteth as touching the cause of his flight, and seemeth to be most in quaestion now, is that slaughter that hee made of <hi>Baals</hi> Prophets, which was indeed, if not the onely, yet the chiefe cause why <hi>Ieze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. King. 18: 40 Ibid. 19: 2, 3.</note> threatned death vnto him, and for which he fled: neither do we read, that he had any warrant so to do, or that it was of the Lord that he did it; as also it may be that he rather omitted it, as not cleered in his owne conscience now, but that it was some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing inordinately done. True it is, that by the Law of God they were to bee put <note place="margin">Deut. 13: 1-5.</note> to death: but we doe not know, that any such authority was to him committed; and hee did not, it seemeth, speake to the King to doe Iustice on them, but directed his speach to the people for that matter, euen in the praesence of the King who onely was interessed therein, for any thing that appeareth yet to the contrary. The latter part of his answere was, that thereupon he was fled thyther: which, as I said, he doth not plainely alleage; but onely leaueth it, as it were, implyed. But, as I saide withall, eyther wee must take it to bee implyed, or else that hee did not directly aunswere: which of the two, I thinke were the harder. And yet if the Prophet did leaue that to be implyed (namely, that on that occasion he was fled thyther) although indeede that was the onely cause that he fled: yet out of the circumstance of so long a time, and of the distance and dignity of the place, it may seeme, that some other respect <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> concurred withall. This being his answere, the course that was taken for the fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of it to some better order, was, that first there was, as it were, such matter laide foorth vnto him, as out of which hee might learne to doe it: then, was hee asked the quaestion againe. To the end hee might the better heede the matter that shoulde be layde foorth vnto him, out of which hee might learne to frame his aunswere bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he is first willed to come forth, and to stand on the Mountaine before the Lord: <note place="margin">1. King. 19: 11, 21.</note> seeming to imply, that so hee might take the better heede, to that which there hee should see and heare. At which time it may be he came forth: though it bee not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred till some-what after. That which was done (whether hee came foorth at the first or not, to be partaker of it) consisted of diuers particulars: of which it is sayde for the most part of them, that the Lorde was not in them: but one there is, wherein it may seeme the Lord was taken to be, and yet it is not plainely spoken, no more than it is thereof denied. In those of which it is saide, that the Lord was not in them, it is to be marked, that albeit in euery of them it be denied in particular: yet of them al generally it is plainly said that the Lord went by; and, as it seemeth to import, euen in them all that there are named. And true it is, that the Lord hath his hand in such thinges also: though in other good sense hee might bee denyed as then to be in them. Those wherein he was denyed to bee, were all of a forcible, or violent Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: one of them a mighty strong Winde, renting the Mountaines, and breaking
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:7530:203"/> the Rockes before the Lord; two others of great force too, but hauing nothing spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially noted of them, but such as inseparably goeth with the Nature of them, the Earth-quake making the Earth to mooue, and the Fire not beeing able to continue but by consuming some-thing. And wee, whensoeuer we are in any kinde of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent or immoderate motion of the minde, are to knowe, that that lightly is not of God, but a meere perturbation of Flesh and Blood, howsoeuer it may seeme to be to our selues, but pure zeale, onely on behalfe of Gods glory. That one, wherein it may seeme the Lord was taken to bee, was that still and soft voyce: and it seemed that <hi>Eliah</hi> conceiued the Lorde was in it, because then hee couered his face with <note place="margin">Ibid. 13.</note> his Mantle; as also at that time it is not denyed the Lorde to bee there, as it was in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> the other, and because then there came a voyce from the Lorde vnto him. Out of all which, <hi>Elias</hi> may gather, that if hee had not some speciall calling to that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of <hi>Baals</hi> Prophets, then had hee beene too forward in it, and that it was not pure zeale onely that carryed him vnto it, but that there was mingled some humaine perturbation there-with. So that now hee might haue gathered, that it was not GOD that directed to any inordinate dealing: and therefore, that, if that were his case, some of his owne humane perturbation, had therein associated it selfe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that, which hee thought to haue beene pure zeale onely towardes God. And this might hee haue gathered so much the rather, first, because GOD might so plainely seeme to haue quaestioned with him, what occasion it was that hadde brought him thyther: then, because his other dealing with him also might seeme to poynt the same way also. For in that hee asked him what hee did there, hee might easily take it to bee of that Nature, as his quaestion was vnto <hi>Adam,</hi> when hee asked him, where hee was: not, that hee had any such regard vnto the <note place="margin">Gen. 3: 9.</note> place where then hee was; but that by putting him in minde how hee had hidden himselfe there, hee would thereby haue him to finde out his sinne, the onely cause of that his hiding. His dealing with him beside, what dooth it else, but onely reprooue all immoderate roughnesse, and commend vnto him gentle and quiet moderation? And although it bee not plainely sayde of that still voyce that GOD was therein, as it was plainely sayde of euery of those violent courses, that God was not in them: yet is it enough, that when as hee was so plainely denyed to be in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, hee is not denyed to bee in this; hauing such other Testimonies besides, that then he was there. For indeede, euery still and soft voyce, is not of him: and so, it may he, that therefore it was not then affirmed, least that should be taken, to bee as generall as the other. For though no violent or rough dealing bee euer of GOD: yet neyther is all easie and soft dealing of him, as wee may see in <hi>Ely</hi> before. God <note place="margin">1 Sa. 2: 23-25, 29. 3. 11-13</note> hauing in this sort layde him out matter enough, out of which hee might haue fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med his aunswere in some better manner, then asketh hee him the selfe-same quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion againe: expecting belike (and that in great mercy) after that now hee hath so plainely pointed him vnto it, and so well holpen him therein, to haue that aunswere <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> of his amended, which came so defectiue from him before. So with vs also. For whensoeuer God doth point vs to any slip that we haue made, and withall affordeth vs his helpe to amend it, we may well account it to be one of the chiefe and principall fauours that hee bestoweth on those that are dearest vnto him. And it is good to note, that he doth not by name deliuer vnto him what it is that he would haue to bee farther cleered: but onely asketh the quaestion againe: that wee may learne thereby, euer to keepe so good account of all our wayes, as that if at any time wee bee cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in quaestion for any of them, wee may sooner be able to finde what it is, and then set in hand with amendment of it. Howe farre this dealing of GOD prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayled with him, may soone bee seene; beeing, so farre as wee may perceiue, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all: the Prophet making the selfe-same aunswere that hee did before. A notable patterne, how hardly wee can finde out our owne defectes, though God <note place="margin">Ibid. 14.</note> himselfe doe point vs vnto them, and yeelde vs speciall good helpe therein: when as so notable a Prophet as this, though hee had those helpes, yet neuerthelesse was defectiue in it. And as the Prophet persisting still in his former aunswere, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:7530:203"/> at all amending it yet, might easily make one to conceiue, that hee stood very cleere therein, but that this dealing of God with him, is a stronger witnesse against him: so may the better sort of vs likewise bee so fast setled in our owne ouer-wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of our selues, that easily may wee induce others to be of opinion that wee are right, when neuerthelesse wee are very wrong, vnlesse they haue the wisedome and grace, resolutely to make tryall of vs by the exact word of God. Howe it was with Saint <hi>Peter</hi> himselfe in such a-like case wee cannot certainely say: though hee <note place="margin">Iohn. 21: 15-17.</note> also, it seemeth, by persisting in his aunswere, vnderstood as little the meaning of Christ. But sure we are, that such as would bee his onely successors since, and their complyces and adherents, many of them sufficiently furnished, with humane capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, wisedome, and learning, haue eyther not seene (or else haue dissembled) what should be the meaning of Christ therein: euery where so busily hanching at some probabilities for their desired Primacy, that this place also must needes bee of that matter too; neuer perceiuing (at least not acknowledging) though a matter as easie to bee seene (to such as haue not theyr eyes fore-stauled already) as in a fayre daie the Sunne in the Firmament, that Christ allowed not that to stand for any sufficient <note place="margin">Ibid. 7.</note>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> token of his loue towardes him, that so readily hee leaped foorth of the shippe to come first vnto him, but much rather by diligent imploying himselfe about those that he left behinde him. Another example sufficient to shewe, how hardly the best of vs all, in our owne case especially, doe at any time pierce to the depth of that which is by God deliuered vnto vs: but the parties in this case beeing of a baser kinde, and much more fore-stauled, than was that party that wee spake off before in the other. Hauing thus farre dealt with him about his comming thyther, and get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting no better aunswere of him now than before (which notwithstanding hee qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly putteth vppe: a token of a wonderfull loue and patience in him) then hee im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployeth him about some other seruice besides. But heere it is not amisse to marke, that after in this hee vseth in his seruice others besides, and not onely <hi>Elias,</hi> as hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto this hee had doone: and yet that afterward hee both vseth him agayne, and vouchsafeth him extraordinary and speciall fauour. But because it pleaseth GOD no more to vse the seruice of <hi>Elias</hi> after this for a time, therefore wee are not nowe to prosecute his Story any farther yet: but onely so farre as this prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent place dooth giue vs occasion. Heere therefore wee are to see, what ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice it was about which it pleased GOD to imploy him nowe: and howe it was by him performed. In that about which it pleased GOD to imploy him <note place="margin">1. Kings. 19: 15-18.</note> nowe, it pleaseth God both to direct him in that which hee should doo: and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all to acquaint him before, with the effect that it should take. That which hee was directed to doe, was now no difficult peece of seruice, but yet part of it some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what daungerous: but the residue of it both very easie, and altogether without daunger too. That which was of no difficulty (I meane for the laboriousnesse of it) but yet some-what dangerous, was, that hee was to goe and annoynt two se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall persons to succeede in two Kingdomes, to those that nowe raigned in them: <hi>Hazael,</hi> for the Kingdome of <hi>Syria,</hi> the King at that time beeing <hi>Benhadad;</hi> and <hi>Iehu,</hi> for the Kingdome of Israell, <hi>Ahab</hi> as yet raigning there. The daunger of which peece of seruice, was, that if those that then raigned should get vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing thereof, then were the life of the Prophet in daunger, without some spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> protection had of God: as <hi>Samuell</hi> made no other reckoning before, when he <note place="margin">1. Sa. 16: 2.</note> was to goe and annoynt <hi>Dauid</hi> while <hi>Saule</hi> yet raigned. That which was both very easie, and altogether without daunger too, was to annoynt <hi>Elisha</hi> (common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called <hi>Elisens)</hi> Prophet in his roome. The effect that this his seruice shoulde take, was, that God would make those whom hee should so annoynt, Instruments of his iudgementes agaynst many of them for theyr sinnes: and yet, notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding such slaughters as they should make, hee would leaue seauen thousand in Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell, all of them such as had not polluted themselues with the Idolatry of <hi>Baal;</hi> but therein making no mention at all of that other Idolatry of the Calues that raigned among them. That this seruice was by him performed, though we may well hope the best, yet we do not finde, sauing onely for that part of it which was without danger, <note place="margin">1.

When he did but onely desire to haue it, it was because it lay so neere vnto him; <note place="margin">1. King. 21: 1, 2</note> and, to make him a Garden of it: and withall, he offered to giue another Vine-yard better for it; or the worth of it in Money. A reasonable Gentleman, in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of many meaner with vs. What his falt was, when although it were ill gotten, he neuerthelesse entered into it, that we may the better find, we had need first to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider of the getting of it: then, of his entering into it. Ill gotten it was by <hi>Iezebels</hi> meanes: but himselfe gaue some occasion of it. The occasion hee gaue, may it selfe likewise be occasioned by the nay that <hi>Naboth</hi> did giue him. For notwithstanding <hi>Ahabs</hi> faire offer, <hi>Naboth</hi> did plainely deny it: standing, as it may seeme, on some <note place="margin">Ibid. 3.</note> conscience therein; but it may likewise bee, that he was more stiffe therein, than ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conscience, or wisedome required. For it may well bee, that the Lawes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning that matter, did not so much tend to instruct priuate men what they should <note place="margin">Leu. 25: 23. Num. 36: 7-9.</note> not in duty do, as to shew vnto all priuate and others, how farre their power should <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> be in that matter restrained, or that they should not be able to do it: and, that in du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty they bind Magistrates chiefly to see them obserued; and not priuate men so much, but so farre as their owne estate shall beare, because healloweth them if neede be, to
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:7530:204"/> sell, but then himselfe prouideth how those Landes shall come againe, and, as they in their measure are to bee carefull to haue all the Lawes of God obserued. Againe, if hee stood but on conscience onely, then might hee haue yeelded it so farre vnto him, as by the Law of God hee might haue done: but that he dooth not, that heere wee reade of. And then, so stifly refusing to gratifie the King therein, so farre as hee could not but see himselfe cleered of the Lawe of GOD for that matter, it might well occasion the King (yea, and any other Neighbour or Friend, that might account himselfe to haue any speciall interest in him) to take it as vnkindly and ill as <hi>Achab</hi> did: at least it is plaine, that it was the occasion of his owne ouerthrowe, as soone after appeared. The occasion that <hi>Ahab</hi> hereupon gaue, was, that he tooke <note place="margin">1. Kin. 21: 4-6.</note> it so impatiently as hee did: and that hee imparted the cause of his griefe vnto the Queene. In that hee tooke it so impatiently as hee did, it was very ill, though hee hadde beene but a priuate man, and needy withall: but much worse in that hee was the King, and therefore neyther had himselfe any such neede, and by his office hee was to see, that the Lawes of God (and that Law among others) were in all his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome duly obserued. In that hee imparted his minde to the Queene, although it may be he had no such meaning, that shee should any way attempt the obtaining of it inordinately: yet was it in common reason most likely, that to gratifie him, she wold be doing after her manner: and his fault therein was the greater, in that hee left his Seale so carelesly too, that shee might come so easily to it, and vse it so badly as shee did. Himselfe hauing thus far giuen some occasion, shee quickly taketh the mattet in hand: first deliuering a peece of her mind vnto him: then setting in hand with her bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse. In deliuering her mind vnto him, both she reproueth him, as not gouerning <note place="margin">Ibid. 7.</note> well, in that he tooke not vpon him better than so: and biddeth him set his heart at rest for that matter. Setting in hand with her businesse, the effect of all is this: first, to make him a way vnto it; then, to get him to take it vnto him. To make him a way vnto it, she taketh her course to woorke by certaine Instruments: and <note place="margin">Ibid. 8-10.</note> they doe according as shee praescribeth. Her Instruments were the Nobles and cheefe Men of the Citty▪ where <hi>Naboth</hi> dwelt, to whom shee wrote in the Name <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> of the King, and sealed the Letters with his Seale, to publish a Fast (as to inquire of some speciall sinne committed among them) to lay to <hi>Naboths</hi> charge, that hee had blasphemed GOD and the King, to haue witnesses ready, to bring him to his tryall, and to stone him to death thereon: and they doing accordingly as shee prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed, <note place="margin">Ibid. 11-14.</note> when so they had doone, they sent her word of it. To get him nowe to take it vnto him, both shee stirreth him vp so to doe; and telleth him withall that <note place="margin">Ibid. 15. Ibid. 16.</note>
               <hi>Naboth</hi> is dead. Which when <hi>Ahab</hi> heard, he neuer inquireth (that we read of) what was doone in that matter, nor how <hi>Naboth</hi> came to his death (though it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, by the report of <hi>Iehr,</hi> as he related the matter to <hi>Bidcar</hi> one of his Captaines, and that as deliuered by the Lord himselfe, that his Sons also were put to death with <note place="margin">2. King. 9: 25, 26.</note> him, and then was the murther so much the more hainous) but praesently addressed himselfe, to go and take possession: as many of our heires doe, who succeeding vnto their Fathers, whom they knew to be hard men to others, &amp; to haue come to much of their lands and goods by some kind of iniurious dealing, neuertheles do neuer enter into any such consideration, but readily enter into the fruition of those thinges them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues. How it pleased God to deale with him about this sin of his, that wee may the better finde, we are to note that iudgements were first but onely denounced against him: but afterward executed also. When iudgements were denounced against him, as he had <hi>Iezebell</hi> partaker with him in his sin: so was she made partaker with him in those iudgements also. <hi>Elias</hi> therefore was now sent vnto him againe, to meet him at the Vineyard of <hi>Naboth,</hi> there to doe his message vnto him, by denouncing vnto him such iudgments as he would cast on him for it: and <hi>Ahab</hi> was so touched there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, <note place="margin">1. King. 21: 17, 18.</note> that in some sort he humbled him thereon. Vnto the denouncing of which iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments it doth appertain, that immediatly after we haue set downe, that which may be some farther reason, why the Lord dealt in such sort with him. In the denouncing of those his iudgements, the Prophet, wee may well conceiue, deliuered what was appoynted vnto him: but yet it shall bee good, that wee distinctly marke what pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:7530:205"/> therein betwixt God and the Prophet; and then, what passed betwixt the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet and the King. Betwixt GOD and the Prophet there passed of this matter some-thing twice: vppon the former of which, some-thing likewise passeth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Prophet and the King; but nothing (that wee reade of) vppon the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. That which the former time passed betwixt the Lord and the Prophet, was, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> the Lord directed him, how to speak to the King, first as touching his fault: then, as touching some part of the punnishment which should light (as it were) on his owne <note place="margin">Ibid. 19.</note> person. That which now passed betwixt the Prophet and the King, was, first that the King (eyther at their first meeting, or on deliuery of this first part of his message, <note place="margin">Ibid. 20.</note> as it seemeth, for it is not plainely expressed) spake to the Prophet, tearming him his Enemy, and shewing himselfe greeued, that there hee had found him: then, that the Prophet, answering somewhat (yet but little) of that his finding of him, and so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming <note place="margin">Ibid. 20-22.</note> to the matter, first telleth him that he is become, or hath made himselfe excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping sinfull before the Lord; then, hee assureth him (not, as in the name of the Lord, but as in his owne: yet not vnlikely, but that some other speeches passed betwixt them, though not mentioned heere, whereby all might be cleered to come from the Lord; and yet the Prophet might in good sense so speake in his owne person also) first for himselfe, that he would bring euill vpon him, then for his yssue or linage (first simply, then by comparison of two other Families) that hee would vtterly destroy them, and withall sheweth why. That which the latter time passed betwixt the Lord and the Prophet, was, as touching the fearefull end of <hi>Iezebell:</hi> and of <hi>Achabs</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ibid. 23, 24.</note> stocke, that it also should be strangely destroyed, for the substance of it, the same in effect that was saide before. That farther reason, why the Lorde dealt in such sort <note place="margin">Ibid. 25, 26.</note> with him, is yeelded to be, for that he did so farre exceede in wickednesse, prouoked thereto by his Wife: and more specially, that his Idolatry was so exceeding great. In <hi>Achabs</hi> humbling of himselfe, we haue noted, first, in what sort hee did it: then, how <note place="margin">Ibid. 27-29.</note> it pleased God to accept of it. In that which he did, wee may note, seeing it was no true repentance that was in him, how many things may be in a Child of the world, which may seeme to boad true repentance, which notwithstanding is none indeede. In that it pleased God so to accept of it, we may note likewise, that if God so accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of that his sorrowing which was no true repentance, much more may wee assure our selues that he will accept of that which is true indeed: and that, as his repentance was not true, so the acceptance of God did not extend it selfe to the remitting or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> of those his iudgementes, but onely to the deferring or putting off the most part of them to a farther day.</p>
            <p n="9">9 How these iudgements were accordingly executed, we haue not to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> of now, but onely for one part of them, which appertaineth to this Story, and (as it were) to his owne person too: the residue wee are to looke for in the Stories ensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. That which wee haue in this Story of him, is how hee came to his end: and therein withall, how some part of those iudgments that were foretold him, were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted on him. Comming to his end as he did, it is good for vs to note, by what mean he came thereunto: and then what end he had thereby. The mean whereby he came thereunto, was, by a certaine warre that then he entred into: first, as it seemeth, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting an error in that, but himselfe resolued thereon; but then most plainely ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his choyce ill, in the aduise that was giuen vnto him. It seemeth he commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted an errour in that, but himselfe resolued thereon, for that hauing made peace with the King of <hi>Syria,</hi> himselfe (for any thing wee finde to the contrary) would needes <note place="margin">1. King. 22: 1-3</note> first breake it, and so enter into needlesse warres. For it doth not appeare, but that he was content to make peace with <hi>Benhadad</hi> before, without demaund of that Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty then, when as he had fitter opportunity so to doe: neyther doth hee now make his quarrell, that it was one of the Citties that should haue beene restored when the peace was made, as hauing hitherro kept it from him contrary to their agreement; but that time was, when it did belong vnto them. Diuers opinions I know there are of the cause of this warre: and, among others, that it was <hi>Ahabs</hi> duty to make this warre, for the recouery of that Citty, because God had giuen it vnto the people <note place="margin">Pet.

               <pb n="389" facs="tcp:7530:205"/> of Israell before. But the same God that giueth such thinges oft-times to one, doth iustly take them away againe, and bestoweth them on some other: and in this case, neither was his owne Tytle to the Kingdome itselfe, very cleere; neyther haue wee so good warrant in the Text, anyway to take it, as that nowe hee entered into a needlesse warre. In the aduice that was giuen vnto him, wherein hee made his choyce so ill, we are likewise first to consider what aduise it was that was giuen him: then, of the choyce that himselfe did make. The aduise that was giuen him, was first by a King who then was with him, and in the way of friendship came to make <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> merry with him, <hi>Iehoshaphat</hi> the King of <hi>Iudah:</hi> then, by others of those parts neere vnto him. The aduise that <hi>Iehoshaphat</hi> gaue him, was by occasion that the King of <hi>Israell</hi> desired his company in that his warfare: whereunto hee readily yeelded; <note place="margin">1. Kin. 22: 4-6</note> but then desired withall, that first he would aske counsell of the Lord therein. This aduise being giuen (and that plainely enough, though but in the forme or manner of a request) the King thereuppon sent but for such as ordinarily went vnder the name of Prophets among them: but he got together enow of those (if they were not mo than a good many) euen foure hundred persons, or there-about. Who these should bee, it is not agreed: most men taking them for the Prophets of <hi>Baal;</hi> and some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinuating, <note place="margin">Lyr. Martyr. Bibl. Angl.</note> it seemeth, they were such as were gotten together in the place of those that <hi>Elias</hi> had slaine, which is in effect (being so taken) all one with the other. For they were the Prophets of <hi>Baal</hi> that by him were slaine. But it seemeth to me, that these were the Prophets of the Groues before mentioned: both because the number doth so well agree; and because these doe speake in the name of the Lord. Ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">1. King. 18: 19.</note> doe I finde, that the Prophets of <hi>Baal</hi> did praetend the name of the Lord, as is conceiued: but rather as we haue it in one place plainely, that they professed but <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pet. Martyr.</note> onely. For there it is said, that they called on the name of <hi>Baal,</hi> from Morning <note place="margin">1 King. 18▪ 26. Ibid. 19. 22. 40 2 Chro. 17: 6. 34: 3. 1 King. 14: 23 2.

And this may wee the rather conceiue, both because diuers of the Kinges of <hi>Iudah</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 King. 15: 14, 22: 43 2 King. 12: 3, 14▪ 4. 15: 4, 35 2 Chr. 20: 33. 2 Chr. 33: 17</note> are much commended in the cause of Religion, who yet notwithstanding are noted withall to haue tollerated the peoples worshipping in their high-places: and because wee haue it plainely set downe, in the Story of <hi>Manasses,</hi> that although the people <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> did wotshippe in their High-places, yet was it not but only vnto the Lord their God; as also the <hi>Assyrians</hi> their Neighbours (though enemies then) and priuy enough to their manner of worshipping, would make the people to doubt they were not able to stand in their hands now, because <hi>Hezechiah</hi> their King had taken away the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>places <note place="margin">2 King. 18: 22</note> where the Lord their God was worshipped, and noted no other defect in the peoples worshipping therein, but that <hi>Hezechiah</hi> would haue had them to doe that in Ierusalem, which they did in those their high-places. Those therefore (it seemeth) were none other but such as indeed professed the Lord: &amp; yet in no other maner, but as the kingdome of <hi>Israel</hi> did, after that now they were deuided from the rest of their Brethren. So that, when <hi>Iehoshaphat</hi> desireth him to aske counsell of the Lord, he go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth but only to these, that though they still professed the Lord, yet had they far depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from him: but thinking belike to make vp in number, that which hee wanted in weight and measure. And so doe many in these daies also, when they praetend their meaning is to inquire of the Lord, neuerthelesse not but to go vnto those that though they retaine the profession of him, yet are they departed farre from him: not hauing the grace to repaire vnto those, whom by the testimony of the word it selfe they may find, to be such indeede, as by whom they may bee assured, to haue their dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction euen from the Lord. Those others that were of those parts neere vnto him
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:7530:206"/> were of two sorts: many that did aduise him vnto it; but one that did disswade him from it. Of those that did aduise him vnto it, some we haue of whom we are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <note place="margin">1 King. 22: 6, 11, 12</note> for that matter: others there be of whom we haue but likelihood onely. Those of whom we may be certaine for that matter, were those foure hundred Prophets, who all aduised him to set forward, assuring him that hee should praeuaile; one of them also (and not vnlikely but that it was done with the priuity of the rest, in the name of them all) confidently assuring the same by a visible signe of those Iron. hornes. Those others of whom we haue but likelihood onely, are those that did attend him, especially his Captaine and Martiall men: and the likelihood we haue, <note place="margin">Ibid, 13, 14</note> is that one of his attendants beeing sent to <hi>Micaiah,</hi> did earnestly labour him (though but in vaine) to frame his speach to Iump with theirs. As touching that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> one that disswaded him from it, wee are to consider, first, how hee came into that company: then, in what sort he did disswade him. Being to consider how he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so was brought into that company, it is not amisse first to consider of his leauing-out hitherto: then, of his bringing in now. That he was hitherto left out, and yet so great store of others brought in, it rightly noteth both the finister iudgement of worldly people: and of what reckoning the truer Seruants of God may looke to be of heere. His bringing in now, was both mooued and vrged too, by <hi>Iehoshaphat;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ibid. 7-12</note> and then performed by <hi>Achab:</hi> as they both sate together, while those foure hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred peophecied before them, and deliuered their iudgement vnto them. In which it is good farther to note, first in those Princes, that <hi>Iehoshaphat,</hi> a man that had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to God indeede, could not content himselfe with those degenerate Prophets, though <hi>Ahab</hi> could: then in those Prophets, that though themselues might plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly see (if they could rightly examine themselues by the word of God: and so might ours aswell as they) that they were farre departed from God, and from all sincerity in him; yet can they asmuch assure themselues, that hee doth acquaint them with his Will and pleasure, as if they were his true seruants indeede. <hi>Michaiah</hi> being now brought vnto him, and we being to see, in what sort he doth disswade the king from it: that intended voyage, because it will fall out in the end, that it was not wel accepted, therfore we are first to see in what sort he disswaded the kings from it: then, how it was accepted of them. The manner of it was, that he did not at the first fall to disswade him: but in plaine tearmes made a kind of shew, that he also did approue it. For being asked by the King of <hi>Israel,</hi> whether they should go vppe <note place="margin">Ibid. 15</note> against <hi>Ramoth Gilead,</hi> or not, Go vp, saith he, and prosper: and the Lord shal deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer it into the hands of the King. Which words in what sence he vttered, it is not declared in the Text: and the learned are not all of minde in it. It seemeth to me, that the Prophet conceyuing no hope that any thing would be accepted, but onely that which was to their owne liking, did therefore after a sort accorde therunto: and yet not but in such sort withall, as that the King perceiued he spake not in the freedome of his owne mind. Which also I should rather impute to some infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in him, notwithstanding he was otherwise resolued before (for such infirmitie is in the best) rather than account him so bold, as, at the first, in the presence of those two Kings set in their Maiesty, honourably (no doubt) attended, and before those foure hundred Prophets had any way opposed themselues against him, to speake it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> in the way of a scorne to them, which is the iudgement of the most that I meet with. <note place="margin">Conr.

When hee came to disswade it indeede, wee are there also to consider, in what manner hee did it: and how hee did farther confirme it, when hee sawe it called in question. Vnto his manner of dooing of it, doo appertayne the occasion giuen him▪ and in what sort he dealt thereupon. The occasion giuen him was, that the King, perceyuing he spake not with that freedome, that might fully cleare the same to bee his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:7530:206"/> did earnestly charge him to tell him truely, what it was that he vnderstoode to be indeede the Lords pleasure therein. And this, it seemeth, was not so much to let <hi>Iehoshaphat</hi> see, that he neuer prophesied good vnto him, as it is taken (thogh it may be, that also was his meaning, and it is plaine that he did so apply it after:) a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

His dealing heereupon was, that he plainly told him, as touching that <note place="margin">Ibid. 17.</note> matter, both what he saw: and how the Lord himselfe did interpret the same vnto him. Namely, that he saw all <hi>Israel</hi> scattered vpon the Mountaines, as Sheep that had no Shepheard: and that the Lord saide vnto him, These haue no Mayster; let euery man returne vnto his house in peace. This so plainly implyed a strong dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion, that <hi>Ahab</hi> himselfe right well perceyued it, notwithstanding that other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise he was earnestly set on the contrary: but yet he interpreted it, as of some spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
               <note place="margin">Ibid, 18.</note> bearing of the Prophet hardly against him; as neuer prophecying good vnto him, but euer euill. Whereupon the Prophet adding farther confirmation to that he had saide before, first requiring all to giue eare, and telling them it was the word of the Lord: then, he telleth them how farre him-selfe was made acquainted with <note place="margin">Ibid. 19. 23.</note> this matter; and sheweth the King the plaine meaning thereof towards him. Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe was made acquainted both by sight and hearing of an honourable assembly in heauen the Lord sitting in the Throne of his Maiesty, and all his hoast about him: first propounding, how <hi>Ahab</hi> might be enticed to go to <hi>Ramoth-Gilead</hi> to his own ruine there; then concluding, that it should be by a lying spirit in the mouths of all his Prophets. The plaine meaning whereof was, that the Lord himselfe had put a lying spirit in the mouths of all those his Prophets; and had determined euill a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him.</p>
            <p n="10">10. How this was accepted of them, we haue plainly set downe for the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> most part of it: but we may gather somewhat more than is expressed. That which is plainely set downe, is, first of one of those Prophets: then, of the King himselfe. That one of the Prophets was <hi>Zidichiah,</hi> who as hee was the chiefe dooer thereof all his fellowes, so may we sufficiently see in him how acceptable these dooings of <hi>Micaiah</hi> was to all the company of them: he striking him there on the face, euen in <note place="margin">Ibid. 24.</note> the sight of them all, as it seemeth; and insolently asking him when the spirite of the Lord went from him, to speak to so base a fellow as he. But the Prophet an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered <note place="margin">Ibid 25.</note> quietly againe, that when that day came, himselfe should then know it: and to auoid the danger thereof, should run from chamber to chamber to hide him. In which act and presumptuous speech of <hi>Zedekiah</hi> we may note, not onely a maruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous bad and sawcy dealing in him, so to strike him in the sight and presence of both the Kings; but in them also, yet chiefely in <hi>Ahab,</hi> very dishonorable dealing too, to suffer him so to be stricken before them: as also, in that the Prophet was so dealt withal then, that the seruants of God must be prepared to beare such dealing; and therein to be assisted, not onely not by <hi>Ahabs,</hi> but also not by <hi>Iehoshaphats</hi> too. <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sephus</hi>

But besides that the Text it selfe hath no such matter. <hi>Zedechiahs</hi> owne words do shewe, that there was no such meaning in him, as had any such sparke of moderation, but that altogether it proceeded of violent passion: and therefore is it so much the stranger, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Lyr.</hi> 1 Kings. 22: 26, 27.</note> that any other should neuerthelesse bee so conceited.

               <pb n="392" facs="tcp:7530:207"/> euer he returned in peace: and withall he willed all the company to marke it well. That which we may gather farther, which is not expressed, is of <hi>Iehoshaphat,</hi> who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inquiring before for some Prophet of the Lord, and yet regarding him so slenderlie now, seemeth to bee strongly bound with the back-bias of that his affinity with <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hab,</hi> seeing he doth no straighter hold on the course he began; a good warning for all, to take heed of such affinitie; and to Princes too, that many good graces, by such vnkindly mixture, may be so abased in them, as that neither may the better sort di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stressed, hope of any great helpe at their hands, nor themselues retaine the account of good Princes indeed. Being thus aduized, by the one sort of them to holde on the course that already they had entred into, but, by those iudgements fore-shewed dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded by that other, what choyce thēselues make of these, is seene by the waies that now they take, holding on the course that before they conceiued, going vp in war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare against <hi>Ramotb Gilead,</hi> either of them making their choyce very ill: the King of <note place="margin">Ibid. 29</note>
               <hi>Israell,</hi> it seemeth, as vtterly destitute of iudgement and grace to chuse any better: the King of <hi>Iudah</hi> not vnlikely but to see hee was wrong, and yet ouer-weake to breake off the course that hee was already entered into. In the Story of his end it seemeth that <hi>Ahab</hi> had some feare of that which was threatened, and that hee did something endeuour to escape it: but yet that it fell on him notwithstanding. His endeuour to escape it, was, not by turning vnto the Lord, and giuing vp the course that he was <note place="margin">Ibid. 30, 31</note> in; but to performe it by a slight of his owne, and the same such withall, as was to put the King of <hi>Iudah</hi> his friend in his roome, especially the King of <hi>Syria</hi> hauing giuen <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> that charge that he did, of which himselfe, as it seemeth, had gotten vnderstanding before: a very good patterne, first what helps they are that vngodly men turne them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues vnto in their distresse; then, how such of the better sort may looke to be dealt withall by the vngodly, when they on good-will so cleaue vnto them, that they goe against their owne conscience therein, and put their liues in hazzard besides. It fell out notwithstanding, that hee by whom hee would haue made his escape, was praeserued: and that the mischiefe fell on himselfe who was the chiefe actor heerein, <note place="margin">Ibid. 32-37.</note> and vsed the base helpe of wily dealing to shrowd him from it.

And it may very well be, that then on the suddaine he did not so much as remember the Lord: or if he did, yet being now in his owne conscience clogged with sinne, hee had not that freedome of conscience, as so readily to call vpon God. But certaine it is, and plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly set downe, that the Lord did deliuer him, and made the <hi>Syrians</hi> to turne aside from him. The mischiefe that fell on him who was the chiefe actor heerein, the King of <note place="margin">2 Chr. 18: 31</note>
               <hi>Israell,</hi> was, that he had his deaths wound in the field, by an arrow very casually shot (as to the iudgement of man it might seeme) and thereupon died that euening in the field: and to make it more plaine to be of God, it seemeth the <hi>Syrians</hi> did not get the field that day because the likelihood rather inclineth, that the Proclamation to <note place="margin">1 King. 22: 36</note> giue them licence to depart, is meant to bee in the hoast of <hi>Israell</hi> (the Story going chiefly of it; and most likely, that if it had beene in the Hoast of the <hi>Syrians,</hi> it would haue beene mentioned so by name) and because the King of <hi>Israell,</hi> though woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, <note place="margin">Ibid. 35 2 Chr. 18: 34</note> yet stoode still in his Chariot against the enemy vntill euen; and because wee read of none other slain besides. And that he abode in the field til he died, it appeareth in this, that his death, and the said Proclamation (it belike being made immediately <note place="margin">1 King. 22 36 2 Chr. 18: 34 <hi>Pet. Martyr.</hi> 1 King. 22: 17</note> thereupon) are both set downe to haue beene at the going downe of the Sunne. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch that whereas it is conceiued, that the <hi>Israelites</hi> lost the field &amp; fled, it seemeth to be on that praediction of the Prophet, that he saw all <hi>Israel</hi> scattered on the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, as sheepe that had no shepheard: but that may well be meant of their manner of returning home when they were dismissed, and is found by this, that so it ought the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> rather to be taken. And the hand of God being so strange heerein, as it seemeth it was, the Captaines and Souldiers, as they returned had the better occasion to call
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:7530:207"/> to remembraunce the sinne of <hi>Ahab</hi> in the cause of <hi>Naboths</hi> Vineyard, for which this iudgement was cast vpon him; and to admonish themselues to take heed of the like. That part of those iudgements that were fore-told him, and was heerewith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all executed on him, as appertaining to this Story, was, that when his Charriot and <note place="margin">1 King 22: 38</note> Armour, all stained and much defiled with his blood, issuing out of that his wound as he stood in his Charriot so long, were had to the poole of <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>cked off <hi>Naboths</hi> blood before. It was no paine nor shame to him, when once he was gone, that so base creatures should be so bold with his royall bloud: but comming from the hande of God, as some part of his punnishment, and so fitly answering his sinne before, it may iustly strike a speciall horror into the hearts of those that being of the greater sort, stand so much on the aestimation of their blood, and yet can hardly brooke that any of their <hi>Naboths</hi> dwell quietly by them. It is reported immediately after (as a reference <note place="margin">Ibid. 39</note> for no where haue we the Story now) that he builded diuers Citties, yea, &amp; made an house of Iuory (a speciall odde vanity, Iuory being but Elephants teeth; and so <note place="margin">Aria. Montan.</note> the Originall tearmeth it, the house of the tooth:) but how much better hadde it beene for him, either to haue walked more vprightly in that matter of <hi>Naboth,</hi> and as a strong and mighty Protector to all good dealing, against whosoeuer should go about to impeach the same, or when he had slipped therein to haue stirred vp him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to sound and true repentance for it; than omitting those, to build him mo Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, much fewer being moe than he could gouerne, or to spend his Treasure or time in so needlesse and vaine a toy of an Iuory house? But this foolishnesse also is stoutly followed by many of vs: especially of those, by whom our <hi>Naboths</hi> find it so hard a matter to dwell, or quietly to enioy what God hath giuen them, and themselues by their honest labour haue got them.</p>

Seeing therefore we haue the Story of his taking vp, before we haue any Story of <hi>Iehoram</hi> the King himselfe, and seeing that <hi>Moab</hi> rebelling on the death of his Father, the matter was ommitted or slipped in the raigne of his Brother, it is most likely that hee would set in hande with it so soone as he could after that once he came to the Crown, and <hi>Elias</hi> at that time was gone before: as it is heereby most likely to be before the raigne of <hi>Ioram,</hi> so haue I thought good this time to take it; leauing it not withstanding to the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of other mens iudgements, if they thinke good otherwise to take it. So haue we in the time of <hi>Ahaziahs</hi> raigne, some-thing as touching <hi>Ahaziah</hi> the King: and some-thing of <hi>Elias</hi> the Prophet. In that part of the Story which concerneth the King, something we haue deliuered of him as he was by himselfe, before that God had as it were any dealing with him: then some-thing againe, when it pleased God to lay his hand vpon him. As he was by himselfe before God had any dealing <note place="margin">1 Kings. 22: 5<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

By which occasion he farther vttered more impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety in him than appeared before, for that when hee thought good to seeke farther than to his owne accustomed gods for helpe, neyther did he then seeke to the God of <hi>Israell</hi> in that his distresse, but to the Idoll of <hi>Ekron</hi> the God of Flies. When it pleased GOD to haue some dealing with him, and to lay his hand vpon him, it is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> good to note, wherein God so did: and how that same dealing of God did worke with the King. As touching that which God did, wee find that it was in two thinges: one, in the matter that now we are in; the other, in a purpose that hee had of a voiage on the Seas. In the matter that now wee are in, hee did it twice: first sending him word by the Prophet, that he should not recouer because he sought to <note place="margin">Ibid. 3, 4, 15, 16</note> Gods abroad, as if there were no God in <hi>Israell;</hi> then, when he looked (as it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth) <note place="margin">Ibid. 5-14</note> to haue the Prophet at his command by his earthly forces, twice destroying those forces of his by fire from heauen, and yet sparing the third company of them comming in more dutifull manner vnto him. That purpose that he had of a voiage on the Sea, was to be partner with <hi>Iehoshaphat,</hi> praeparing a Nauie to bee sent to the <note place="margin">1 King. 22: 48, 49. 2 Chr. 20▪ 35-37.</note>
               <hi>Indies</hi> to bring-in Gold: which though he obtained at the hands of <hi>Iehoshaphat,</hi> yet the Lord so brused the whole Nauy with tempest before it set forth, that it was not able to take that voyage; and this the Lord did because <hi>Ahaziah</hi> was partner there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. Concerning which Story, it is good further to note, that whereas diuers there <note place="margin">Lyr. Prt. Mart.</note> be that take it for two seuerall Stories, or that <hi>Iehoshaphat</hi> making two seuerall voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages, <hi>Ahaziah</hi> did seeke to be partner in both, but that <hi>Iehoshaphat</hi> yeelding vnto him in the former, did deny him in the latter (for the Text in one place is plain, that <note place="margin">1 King. 22: 49</note> he did deny him: in another place againe the Text doth witnesse, that the Prophet <hi>Eliezer</hi> did charge him, that he had taken in <hi>Ahaziah</hi> to be partner with him) see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">2 Chr. 20: 37</note> the Scripture maketh no mention, but onely of one such voyage intended, and of none performed, and seeing the place wherein <hi>Iehoshaphat</hi> denyed is the former, and both of them true (both that he denyed, and that he yeelded:) the best recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation seemeth to be, that first he denied (and that we haue plainly recorded) but yet that afterward he yeelded (which indeede we haue no where deliuered vnto vs, but that the Prophet did so charge him, and tolde him that for that cause the Lord had broken his Nauy) and so is it interpreted by others also. How that dealing of <note place="margin">Tremel.

So the Lorde tooke him away when he had raigned but two yeares, nor those full out neither, as by compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the beginning of his and his Brothers raigne togither may soone appeare, him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe beginning in the seauenteenth, and his brother in the eighteenth yeares of <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoshaphat.</hi>

            <p n="12">12 That which we haue of <hi>Elias</hi> the Prophet, and (as it seemeth, as I said before) in the time of this Kings raigne, is of his taking vp into heauen. such ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> example of another estate aboue (after that once we haue done heere) to the Age that then was, as that other of <hi>Enok</hi> was to that other Age that was before; both of them confirmed and much more cleered, by the Ascension of Iesus Christ that followed after. But whereas God, according to his wonted manner, would not take away one, but that he would giue another, so falleth it out, that we are not onely to consider of <hi>Eliah</hi> himselfe: but something also of him, that was left vs in his roome. In that which concerneth <hi>Elias</hi> himselfe, it seemeth God had a speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all respect, both to that people of his then: and to all others generally that in any Age after should come vnto him. That wherein it seemeth God had respect vnto that people then, was, that he would vouchsafe that Prophet of his so speciall ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour: and that hee would haue it in such sort done, as might resolue them of the certainty of it.

For the manner of doing it, wee are first to consider what the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner was: then howe it is, that it might resolue them of the certainety of it. Of the manner of it, some part thereof fell out, as it were, of itselfe: and some part againe was vrged by others.

Whereby also, for these two places, <hi>Bethell</hi> and <hi>Iericho,</hi> it plainely appeareth, and it seemeth for diuers others be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, that there were many of them, that in this corrupt state of theirs neuerthelesse gaue themselues to the study of the Law of God, and had those that exercised them therein: and it is not vnlikely, but that the better sort of the people purposely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tooke themselues to that course, so to retaine the knowledge of God among them still, in those corrupt dayes, so well as they could; as on the other side, that ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther people nor Prince were so egerly bent agaiast the truth of God, but that this sort of people might like-wise finde harbour among them. Those to whom there were some thinges more propper, were <hi>Elias,</hi> and <hi>Eliseus.</hi> In <hi>Elias</hi> wee haue one thing that is no more but onely probable: but some others, that are more certayne. Probable it is, that seeing hee went immediatly before his departure to those two places where those young Prophets and Studentes of Diuinitie were, that hee had to deale with them in some thing of speciall moment: and yet, because wee haue nothing recorded that hee did there, it may bee it is but to direct vs, nowe to beholde in this action of his, that which after wee shall see more fully in Christ. For though Christ imparted the praesence of his naturall body to all, not onely to Disciples, but to all the whole multitude of his Enemyes and Friendes indifferent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, so long as hee was to bee occupyed in the Mynistery for which hee came into the World: yet when hee had doone, was risen againe, had a gloryfied body, and was vppon his departute from them, though hee appeared then also to many, and the same diuers and sundry times, and at one time to fiue hundred at once; yet wee finde not that euer hee imparted the praesence of his gloryfied body, but onely to those that were Disciples. So it may bee, that so farre as the taking vp of this Prophet now, was to raise vp theyr heartes to the consideration of another woorke of that kinde that should afterward bee of farre greater glory, which was the Ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of IESVS CHRIST: so farre likewise shoulde this resemble that other also, in that now after hee had doone his Mynistery, and was to bee taken vppe from them, hee shewed himselfe but onely to the Children of the Prophetes; though before (all the time of his Ministery among them) he imparted himselfe to all indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Those that are more certaine, were, first when he would gone alone: then, when hee tooke <hi>Eliseus</hi> with him.

For it was knowne before to diuers, at least to those Children of the Prophetes at <hi>Bethell</hi> and <hi>Iericho,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ibid. 12.</note> and to <hi>Elisha</hi> withall: seene likewise, out of all quaestion by <hi>Elisha</hi> then with him; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> and, as it seemeth, by those fifty men of the Sonnes of the Prophets, who looked af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them a farre off. And GOD it seemeth would haue it so knowne, to make the authority of his Mynistery while he was on Earth among them, to bee the more regarded with them. But then must all take heede, that none conceiue such a manifestion of such thinges as many a one would himselfe imagine: but that euery one hold himselfe fully contented with such manifestation onely as it pleaseth God in his wisedome to giue vs. He that prophecyed against the Altar in <hi>Bethel</hi> was no sooner gone out of the Citty, but hee was found slaine of a Lyon: this man neuer opened his lippes against the Golden Calues that we reade of (but onely against the Idolatry of <hi>Baal)</hi> and nowe is taken vp into Heauen, And whereas <hi>Elias</hi> was so notable a Prophet, and did not meddle with that kinde of Idolatry (and yet most likely to haue gone so farre as it pleased God to appoint him) it may seeme that God would teach them thereby (and vs with them) that once reproouing must be suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, though it be neuer mentioned more. The respect that heerein God may seeme to haue vnto all generally, is, to teach vs these two Lessons: first that there is another estate abiding for vs in the world to come, and that so glorious, that euen the ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance thereunto is glorious also; then, that in this little seruice of <hi>Elias</hi> so notably re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardad heere, we may conceiue good hope of vndoubted rewarding all faithfull ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice there.</p>

Of those others that hee did as hee returned to those two places where his Mayster was a little before, some there are that were doone in the way: and some others at the places themselues, Those that were done in the way, were two: one, that himselfe also now assayed (but with some diffidence it seemeth, for <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> that hee stayed there for a time, and afterward spake some-what doubtfully too: and yet both these might bee otherwise also) to part the Waters of Iordan, and to come ouer on dry Land as his Mayster had gone before, striking the Waters with his Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters Cloake, and so got passage for his returne, as his Mayster and hee had as they went forward; the other, that those fifty men of the Children of the Prophets <note place="margin">Ibid 15.</note> that were looking after them, perceiuing nowe, that the Spirite of GOD that did rest on <hi>Eliah</hi> before, was now giuen to him, or that hee was endued there-with, came to meete him, and did him reuerence, as vnto him that now was Prophet in his Maysters roome. In the former of which wee may see agayne, that the effect oft-times is better than our Fayth: and in the latter, that where wee see the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite of GOD to haue lighted, there should wee likewise place regard correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. Those two places wherein his Mayster had beene but lately before, were <hi>Bethel</hi> and <hi>Iericho:</hi> but in this his returne hee first commeth to <hi>Iericho,</hi> and then after to <hi>Bethell.</hi> From <hi>Iericho,</hi> it seemeth, there were sent those fifty men of the Sons of the Prophets, to see if they could find the body of <hi>Elias</hi> cast on any of the <note place="margin">Ibid. 16-18:</note> Mountaynes, or in any of the Vallies, as they conceiued it might so bee: and yet it is very playne, they met him on the way; and because the motion of this sending is immediatly noted to haue beene made, therefore might soone conceiue, that they were sent from that place where they met him, and it may bee, that so they were. But it seemeth rather, that seeing they were of <hi>Iericho,</hi> they would first at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend and bring the Prophet thyther: and seeing they tarried forth three dayes in see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> it seemeth they tooke prouision with them; which is not so likely, they had done when they came to meete him, because they knew not then (depending on the Prophet therein, so much as after they did) whether they were to goe about that bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse or not. Againe, it is plainely noted, that they returned to him to <hi>Iericho:</hi> and that the Prophet stayed them there. In which sending, and those so many, so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirously going about that businesse, sparing no time to haue performed it, if it might haue beene doone, and yet not beeing able to doe it, wee may plainely see, that God would yet adde that farther confirmation vnto that his people, that that Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant of his was indeed taken vp, and not taken out of their sight for a time, and then cast down else-where: so the better yet to commend those his former labours among them. While this Prophet was there, the inhabitants of the Citty, or certaine of the <note place="margin">Ibid. 19-22.</note> Elders of them, complained vnto him of the vnwholesomnesse of the Water they had there, and how it made the ground (such belike as lay neerest vnto it, or which some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it did ouerflow) barren also. Which complaint of theirs seemeth not to bee, as onely misliking that they had no better; but on hope they conceiued to haue help by the Prophet: else it is not like the Prophet should so readily haue set in hand with so extraordinary an helpe vnto them. But they so desiring it as they did, and, though ordinary means did fayle, yet seeking to him as ordayned of God, by whom it might please him to woorke extraordinarily, hee yeelded vnto them, and myraculously healed those waters of theirs: God meaning thereby as it seemeth, by this so rare and speciall a woorke, doone by the speciall power of GOD, so much the better to confirme his authority, and to commend his Mynistery vnto the people of his time. But one thing there is therein, which needeth more specially to bee consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered; namely, that the Prophet vsed Salt heerein: a thing that by the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <note place="margin">Lyr.

<pb n="398" facs="tcp:7530:210"/> an occasion, so far foorth, to make it more barren, and not more fruitfull) but that being the way to commend vnto them so much the more the power of God. And true it is, that diuers places of Scripture there be, that seeme altogether to condemne salt of barrennesse; but, if we marke, they are of two sorts: most of them speaking of such earth, as is of saltish nature and ouermatched therewith, or that the whole <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> soyle is salt indeede; but one place there is which speaketh but of small quantity of Salt, by the hand of men cast on the ground, as men sow Corne. Such of them as suppose the ground to bee of saltish nature (as diuers of them do) though the soile it selfe be not meere Salt, yet may they very well boad barrennesse (as indeede they do) <note place="margin">Iob. 39: 9.

Of the other sort of places of Scripture, I remember but one, and it is of a fact of that vngracious Imp, <hi>Abimelek:</hi> who hauing gotten <hi>Sichem,</hi> destroyed the Citty and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed it with Salt; which in like sort is expounded, that he did it to make the soile bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, so to be after vnprofitable to others. But strange it is, that so many of the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned should account, that the sowing of Salt (vnlesse it were in great quantity, which is not likely, and wee doe not reade off there) should make the ground vnfruitfull: when as also it is not said that it was sowne in the fields or grounds thereunto apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining; but in the Citty, which was not to bee sowne, and whose ruins made it vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meete enough to such purpose, without any helpe at all of the other. For there is another vse of Salt in the Scripture, which might seeme to agree to that place much better than this: namely, when it is vsed to signifie a couenant, and that the same should bee inuiolable. In which sense the people of God were willed to haue Salt <note place="margin">Leu. 2: 13.</note> in all their offerings, where also it is called the Salt of the couenant: and when God <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> will assure <hi>Aaron</hi> of certaine Fees, out of the oblations of the children of <hi>Israell,</hi> that euer they should appertaine to him and his, he telleth him that he should bee a coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant <note place="margin">Num. 18: 19.</note> of Salt, as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="399" facs="tcp:7530:210"/> to our place againe, if it bee so, that Salt maketh the Land more fruitfull, then <hi>Eliseus</hi> taking a little Salt, and casting it into the head of the Riuer, did not a thing contrary to that operation which he would haue it to haue with the Water, and the ground that it passed by; but on the contrary side tooke such a matter as directly tended vnto it, though for the quantity it was of no force or vertue to such a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, and as short thereof as might be: as when a while after hee would raise com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity <note place="margin">1.

At <hi>Bethel</hi> we haue such Story of him, as that although the Prophet sustayned no more, than men of his calling might euer looke for at the handes of the World, one way or other: yet did it little become that Citty, that hee should haue it offered vnto him by any of theyrs; they hauing a company of the Children of the Prophets residing among them. The matter was, that as he came thyther, a sort of Children came foorth wondering at him, and mocking him, crying vnto him, Come vppe, thou <note place="margin">2. King. 2: 23, 24.</note> Balde-head, Come vppe, thou Bald-head. But it is not likely, that the Children would haue beene so forward in that matter, especially so many of them (for though they had beene no moe but onely those that by and by were slaine thereupon, which is not so likely, for that the Text it selfe seemeth to make those but part of them) but theyr Parentes also made at all no reckoning of him to speake of, but rather had him in great contempt, or rather in a manifest scorne. But <hi>Eliseus</hi> cursing them thereuppon in the Name of the Lorde, it praesently came to passe, that two Shee-Beares came out of the Forrest, and tare in peeces two and forty of them: a very good example to shew, both how the best men may bee prouoked (especially, by the contempt of theyr persons in such a Function as it; and how readily the Lord dooth in such case take part with them also, and effecteth the cursses that they in greefe of theyr heartes haue vttered.

               <hi>Iudah,</hi> there is this tearmed but <hi>Ioram,</hi> a name of two sillables, and the King of <hi>Iudah</hi> hath then the name of three sillables giuen vnto him, though he also bee otherwise called but <hi>Ioram</hi> too. So it appeareth, that <hi>Iehoram,</hi> and <hi>Ioram,</hi> are all one: and true it is, that they both were called by eyther of them indifferently. Then as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching <note place="margin">2. King. 8: 21, 23, 24.</note> his Story, we haue some-what set downe of him generally: then, more speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally all the residue. Of that which is set downe of him generally, some part there is that doth appertaine to the whole course of his time: but some part there is that doth not belong, as it seemeth, but onely to some part of his time, though therein the Text it be not so distinguished. That which belongeth to the whole course of his time, is, that he did euill in the sight of the Lord, cleauing to the sinnes of <hi>Ieroboam.</hi> In <note place="margin">Ibid. 2, 3.</note> that which it seemeth did not appertaine to his whole time, but onely to some part of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> we are not onely to consider what it is: but withall, whereupon it is, that wee are
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:7530:211"/> so to take it. The thing it selfe is, that it is plainely sayde of him, that hee was not so ill, as his Father and Mother: for that hee tooke away the Image of <hi>Baal,</hi> which <note place="margin">Ibid. 2.</note> his Father had made. The cause wherefore it seemeth that this may not be concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of all his time, but onely of some part of it, is, for that the Prophet a while after <note place="margin">Ibid. 13, 14.</note> dealt so roughly with him, refusing to haue any thing to doe with him, bidding him goe to the Prophets of his Father and Mother; and protesting vnto him, that, but for <hi>Iehoshaphats</hi> sake, he would not haue seene him: which he seemeth he would not haue done, if before this he had departed from those Idols of his Father and Mother. But seeing that one time or other he did depart from them, it is most likely, that it was after that he had receiued good by the Ministery of this Prophet, which he did thrice: once, in his warfare against the <hi>Moabites:</hi> and twice when he was inuaded by the <hi>Siryans.</hi> Comming to consider of those thinges that are set downe more specially of him, wee haue in his Story diuers thinges to bee considered, not onely in his life: but euen in his death also. Those that belong to the Story of his life, are all in a manner onely matters of Warre: and first of his warfare against the <hi>Moabites:</hi> then, how the <hi>Syrians</hi> warred on him. In his warfare against the <hi>Moabites</hi> wee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> haue the occasion first: then, the warre it selfe deliuered vnto vs. The occasion of <note place="margin">Ibid. 4, 5.</note> it is noted to be, that the <hi>Moabites</hi> now withdrew themselues from the tribute that they were wont to pay since <hi>Dauids</hi> time: and so had done in the raigne of <hi>Ahaziah</hi> his Brother, immediatly after the death of <hi>Ahab</hi> his Father. The tribute was an hundred thousand Lambes, and an hundred thousand Rammes (or Weathers) with their Wooll. This when <hi>Mesha,</hi> the King of the <hi>Moabites,</hi> refused to pay, the King of Israell did not consider, that he also and his late ancesters and praedecessors had with-drawne themselues from paying the tribute they ought to the Lord: ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that they had diuided themselues from the Line of <hi>Dauid,</hi> to whom it was most properly due. In the warre itselfe we are to note, first in what sort they proceeded vnto it: then, what was their successe therein. In their proceeding vnto it, we haue deliuered, that the King of <hi>Israell</hi> sought to haue <hi>Iehoshaphat</hi> the King of <hi>Iudah,</hi> to <note place="margin">2. King 3: 6-9.</note> ioyne with him herein: and that the King of <hi>Iudah</hi> readily yeelded for himselfe and his people; and brought with him besides the King of <hi>Edom,</hi> a Vassall of his. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning whom it shall not be amisse to note one thing as touching them all: &amp; some others besides, as touching certaine of them. As touching them all, wee doe not read that now they inquired of the Lord before they set forth about theyr businesse: and that although they had a snub in the way; yet they made no quaestion of the lawfulnesse of theyr businesse, so neyther haue they any thing sayd to them about it. We also, making no quaestion of our purposes oft-times where wee ought, oft-times obtaine the much like fauour, that we are not troubled therein, but suffered to runne our owne course. Such of them as of whom it is good to note some-thing more specially, are <hi>Iehoshaphat</hi> the King of <hi>Iudah:</hi> and the King of <hi>Edom.</hi> Of <hi>Iehosha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phat</hi> we read, that he sped but ill before, in taking part with the wicked (crying out for the danger he was in, and being beaten out of the fielde:) and that the Lord, by <note place="margin">1. King. 22: 32 2. Chr. 18▪ 31. 2 Chr. 19: 1-3</note> one of his Prophets, did very plainely reprooue him for it. He for whom he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooued, was but <hi>Ahab</hi> the Father; and this was <hi>Iehoram</hi> his Sonne, not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but almost as bad as his Father, and it seemeth, that as yet there was no oddes betwixt: <hi>Iehoshaphat</hi> also himselfe is in diuers things of good commendation; and yet is now found in that fault againe, for which he was reprooued before.

And true it is, that he was no absolute King, because he was subiect to the King of <hi>Iudah:</hi> which is the thing that those places meane. But because Kinges oft-times haue Kinges vnder them (as King <hi>Ben-Hadad</hi> had two and thirty, al retaining the Name of Kings, though <note place="margin">1 King. 20: 1, 12, 24. 2 Kings. 3: 9, 10, 12, 13, 21, 23, 26.</note> they were at his command) and the people themselues will rather be the more quyet, if their gouernor retaine his wonted name of King, than if he be abased; and seeing this King of <hi>Edom</hi> is on all hands so called, by the Text, by <hi>Iehoram,</hi> by the <hi>Moabites,</hi>
               <pb n="401" facs="tcp:7530:211"/> and by the King of <hi>Moab</hi> himselfe, it seemeth that the name of the King might bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be giuen him (onely cleering the truth of the matter) than any of those other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior names; especially, seeing those two places that are most against it, doe no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther crosse it neyther, the one of them plainely saying, that the Deputy was King, the <note place="margin">1 King 22: 47 2 King 8▪ 20</note> other importing no more, but that then they made them a King themselues, whereas before they had their King appointed them by the King of <hi>Iudah.</hi> Theyr successe in this expedition was first but hard: but afterward more agreeable to their desires. When it was but hard, yet then they sought vnto the Lord, which we doe not reade they did before: and it is no rare thing, that aduersity maketh vs to remember God, otherwise but sildome thinking of him. The hardnesse of theyr successe at this time <note place="margin">2 King. 3: 9.</note> was, that they all brought themselues into speciall danger, to perish for lacke of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, meeting with none in the way that they tooke, for seauen dayes together: by likelyhood, a maruellous great ouer-sight of them: and yet no strange thing, for the wisest that are, to bee exceeding wrong, yea, euen in their owne faculty (as these, no doubt, for many of them, were expert Leaders) when they forgot to take the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uise of the Lorde with them. In theyr seeking to the Lorde they had but a rough welcome at the first: but afterward they sped better. They had but a rough welcome, when as, vnderstanding that they might enquire of the Lord, by <hi>Elisha,</hi> the <note place="margin">1 Kin. 3: 11, 12</note>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> three Kinges did not send for him, but themselues in person went downe vnto him. Where the Prophet now was, wee doe not know. <hi>Samaria</hi> is the last place that we read of he came vnto: but that seemeth to be too farre now, and if the Prophet <note place="margin">2 King 2: 25.</note> were there, then, when they went out of <hi>Samaria</hi> without him, they left a good peece of theyr businesse behinde them; as also it is the manner of many to doe, and then to make more hast than good speede. It is thought, I graunt, that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <note place="margin">Ioseph. Pet. Ma</note> followed the Campe: but his owne wordes a while after, dealing so roughly with the King of Israell when hee came to him, seeme to impart that hee had little minde to follow. If hee remayned yet in <hi>Samaria,</hi> they then tooke so much the more paynes, to speede them vnto him: if hee were neerer, as the worde <hi>Heere</hi>

               </note> twice vsed (the Originall being so too) doth seeme to import (and yet not so neree, but that the Kinges were fayne to goe downe vnto him, before they came at him) yet thetein also they gaue a rare example of dutifull reuerence vnto the Prophet. And it may well bee doubted, whether great Personages, or others doe euer get any benefite of that sort of the Seruauntes of GOD (towardes theyr inward re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation) till they can bee content so to vse them, as in such case theyr calling requireth. Wheresoeuer the Prophet then was, these three Kinges being come vnto him, hee dealeth roundly with the King of Israell twice: first notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <note place="margin">2 Kin 3: 13, 14</note> this his seeking vnto him now; then againe, notwithstanding his quyet aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere. His seeking vnto him now, might in reason imply, a remorse with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, that hee had not sought vnto him before: and yet the Prophet plainely tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth him, that there is no cause why hee should haue any dealing with him, or (it may bee, his meaning was) why hee should make any reckoning of him; and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth him to goe to those base Prophets whom his Father and Mother so much aestee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. A great liberty of speech: and playne enough in it selfe to shewe, that such tartnesse may bee founde some-times euen in the best men of all: and that great ones too must bee content to take it quyetly some-times at the handes of those that other-wise are farre inferiour vnto them. The quyet aunswere that the King gaue, was as it seemeth, that hee wished the Prophet, not nowe to call <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> such matters to minde, as might prouoke his greefe against them: but fauourably to consider, in what sort hee and the other two Kinges were, both themselues and all theyr Armyes. Notwithstanding, which milde and quiet aunswere the Prophet tolde him againe, and earnestly bound it with a great Oath (the worse sort are very often so offensiue vnto the godlyer) that, were it not that hee regarded the praesence of <hi>Iehoshaphat</hi> the King of <hi>Iudah,</hi> hee would not haue vouchsafed so much as to haue seene him the King of Israell. Which neuerthelesse the King of Israel tooke in good part (for any thing that we find to the contrary:) an example that may be to the greater sort more easily propounded, than conceiued that it will bee pacified; it
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:7530:212"/> may be also, that the King of <hi>Israell</hi> was of greater moderation now, in bearing so quietly that reproofe, than at this time the Prophet was (for men are men) in laying it so roughly vpon him. And experience often teacheth, that those that are occupied in matters of state, &amp; with commendation weld the same, haue better hold of their affections, than many of those, in whom may be sound on behalfe of Gods glory, an excellent zeale. When their successe began to be better, or more a greeable to their desires, first it was but in promise onely: but then in performance after. When it was but in promise onely, first we haue a praeparation towards it: then, the promise it selfe. The praeparation towardes it, was, that the Prophet laboured so much as he did to reduce himselfe to a milder temper: in which his doing, one thing there is that is but implyed heere; but another plainely set downe. That which is but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed heere, is notwithstanding fully gathred out of his words going before: name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that it was for <hi>Iehoshaphats</hi> sake, that now hee did bend himselfe to their good. So is it oft-times, that for some few good, it pleaseth God to extend his goodnesse to many ill. That which is plainly set downe, is, that he woulde haue one that had skil in Musicke to come and play before him: a great likely-hood, that <note place="margin">2 King. 3: 15.</note> he found himselfe to be farre out of temper; and withall, that he was careful to get himselfe into order againe. Finding himselfe out of temper, by that immoderate heare, it seemeth, he accounted himselfe not meete to that purpose, about which he was to be employed now: in seeking to get himselfe into order againe by that kind of meanes, and the hand of the Lord being vpon him thereon, it sheweth likewise, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> that euen the good blessing of God is on Musicke also (and therefore farre from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so vnmeet for some orderly vse thereof in our Churches, as some haue concey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued) readily to bring vs to some temper againe, when orderly it is to that end vsed. The promise it selfe rested in two principall points: one, about the reliefe of theyr praesent necessity; the other, about the businesse they had in hand. For the reliefe of their praesent necessity, first there is a triall of their fayth imposed vppon them: then are they promised, plentifully to be that way releeued. The trial of their faith that is imposed on them, is, that they, a-long by that valley, shoulde make many <note place="margin">Ibid 16.</note> ditches or pits, the better to containe the aboundance of water that should bee gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen them. The reliefe that they were that way promised, was, that though there should be neither winde nor raine, whereof themselues shoulde haue any percey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing: <note place="margin">Ibid. 17.</note> yet should that valley be filled with water, that themselues and theyr Cattle should all haue plenty. Concerning their businesse they had in hande, they were giuen to vnderstand, first by the way of comparison, that this helpe that they had <note place="margin">Ibid. 18, 19.</note> in releeuing that their thirst, should be but a small matter in comparison of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: then, that they should so thoroughly praeuaile against the <hi>Moabites,</hi> that they should haue them all, and all that they had, fully and wholly at their own pleasure. The successe that they had in the performāce insuing, was according to the promise going before: first for the reliefe of that their praesent necessity; thē for their other businesse also. For the reliefe of that their praesent necessity, they had the next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <note place="margin">Ibid. 20.</note> by the way of <hi>Edom</hi> (the same belike that they had compassed seauen dayes together, and all that time could find none) such aboundance of water, that all that valley fully replenished there with. For their other businesse, whereas the <hi>Moa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bites,</hi> when first they vndestoode those Kings were comming against them, had ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered <note place="margin">Ibid. 21.</note> together all that were able to beare Armes, and now were in a readinesse in their owne Borders, wee haue deliuered vnto vs, first how they praeuailed against those that were to stop their entry: then, how they went farther into the Land, and what they did there. Those that were to stop their entry, came into their handes as faire as they could wish, vpon a vaine conceit they had taken vp of themselues, <note place="margin">Ibid. 22. 24.</note> that the Kinges and their Armies had fallen out among themselues, and had slaine one another: and so were put to flight, and many of them destroyed withall. Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> their victorie into the Land, they praeuailed there likewise euen to their own <note place="margin">Ibid. 24. 27.</note> hearts desire: sauing onely that at one of their principall Citties, where <hi>Mesha</hi> the King of <hi>Moab</hi> himselfe was, of themselues they gaue-ouer the War, as hauing prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed farre enough now, and so departed. Whereupon it was that so they did, is
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:7530:212"/> not agreed on by the learned themselues: but it seemeth to be, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>pon detestation, &amp; commisseration mingled withall, of a most vnnaturall and barbarous fact that they saw the King in that his extremity to commit on his owne naturall son, that should haue succeeded him in the kingdome, namely, that when the King had first assayed by a desperate sally to haue broken forth by the King of <hi>Edom,</hi> and could not, then on the walles, in the sight of them al, he sacrificed his sonne: and they on the other side, on the horror and detestation they conceyued thereon, accounting that now he was enough afflicted, would vrge him no farther, but so did leaue him, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to theit Country againe.</p>
            <p n="15">15 The <hi>Syrians</hi> (after this) warring on him, we find that they did inuade <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> him twice: first but comming as it seemeth, to make spoyle in the Countrey; but afterward making head against the whole estate, besiedging the chiefe City there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, <hi>Samaria</hi> it selfe. When they came in but onely to spoile the Countrey, as it seemeth, they were defeated without hurt to either side (that wee read of) while they were in the Countrey: and so dealt withal besides, that for that time they qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly <note place="margin">2 Kin. 6: 8-13.</note> returned, and for a time came-in no more against them. When they were but defeated, and without hurt to either side (that we read of) it was by the means of the Prophet, who diuers times sent worde to the King, and as it seemeth, from time to time continually, so long as there they stayed, still what was their secret in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and purpose against him, to the end that he might cast to preuent them: which also in such sort and so often he did, that the king of the <hi>Syrians</hi> thoght, that he was still betrayed by some of his owne company; till he was giuen to vnderstand, that it was the Prophet in <hi>Israel,</hi> that so discouered his secret counsell. And as at that time it was, that God by <hi>Eliseus</hi> directed the King of <hi>Israel</hi> how to escape the traps that for him were set: so is it still by God, that Princes, armies, and others (euen to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> euery seuerall person) do at any time escape such dangers as are towards them, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed by others, or meerely casuall; though he do not euer shew by what meanes he doth it. When they were so dealt with, that for that time they quietly retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and for a time came in no more against them, it was againe by the meanes of the Prophet. Whom when the King woulde haue surprised, by certaine forces <note place="margin">Ibid. 14-20.</note> that he sent to take him, because he could so discouer his secret intents against the King of <hi>Israel,</hi> the Prophet strangely led those forces into <hi>Samaria</hi> (the head-Citty of the kingdome of Israel) about a dozen miles distant from the place where then the Prophet was: they, all the while, perceiuing nothing, either that already they had the man among them for whome they came; or that now they were led to a place of great disaduantage to them, if so be that same aduantage had beene taken of them. So vainely the greatest Potentates that are employ themselues, whenso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer they attempt any hurt to any of the Seruant of God; at least, when hee is pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to stand to their defence: and yet it is not to be denied, but that God some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times doth giue euen the dearest seruants he hath into the handes of the basest sort of them; but withall, as to the greater encrease of glory to those his seruants, so to the iust condemnation of those that so do vex them. In which Story we haue two other particulars deliuered vnto vs, good to be considered too: one, at <hi>Dotham,</hi> where the Prophet then was, and whither these were come to take him; the other, when he had brought them into <hi>Samaria.</hi> Where the Prophet then was, his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant who attended him then, when he saw those forces without the Cittie, cryed <note place="margin">Ibid. 15-17.</note> out to his Maister, as not knowing how to escape them. Vpon which feare of his, first his Maister tolde him, that those that were with them, were mo than their eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: then, desiring the Lord to open the eyes of that his seruant, the Lord so did, and his seruant then saw the Mountaine round about them full of horses and Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ots of fire. When he had brought them to <hi>Samaria,</hi> the King calling him Father <note place="margin">Ibid. 21-23.</note> then, and shewing himselfe to depend on his direction, offered himselfe readye to fall vpon them, and to put them all to the sword; so ready are the children of the world, by all occasions to execute the malice of their owne hearts, where them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues would gladly bestow it: but the Prophet forbidding that, required to haue
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:7530:213"/> them wel refreshed, &amp; so to be sent to their Maister again, which the King also readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly did; a much better way of the two, and a good example it was, that the King did so readily yeeld therein. And this did so worke in the heartes not onely of these that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> were so well vsed, but euen with the King himselfe besides, that for a time hostility ceased on the <hi>Syrians</hi> side against the <hi>Israelites.</hi> In that other inuasion when they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siedged <hi>Samaria</hi> it selfe, and brought the Citty to great extremity, we are first to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider of the extremity it was brought vnto: then, how it was again releeued. In the extremity it was brought vnto, we are to consider, what it was in it selfe: and how it <note place="margin">2. Kings. 6: 24-29.</note> was taken. It was in it selfe so great, that most vile things that were to homely vse with them, were sold very deere: and two women (it is noted) there were, that agreed together to eate their owne children. The King himselfe did take it so ill, that as it <note place="margin">Ibid. 30-32</note> seemeth, he professed a speciall sorrowing for the same: but on the other side, was so angry with the Prophet, that he deepely protested that day to slay him; and praesent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as it seemeth, sent one about it, and himselfe followed immediately after, belike for the better effecting of it, though others there be (but I see not whereon) that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise <note place="margin">Ioseph. Lyr. Pet. Martyr.</note> take it, as comming to stay the excution which he had before commanded. When the Story sheweth vs, how it was again releeued, it sheweth first how the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet (by whom they were to vnderstand thereof) was, notwithstanding the Kinges determination, praeserued: then after, it treateth of the releefe it selfe that was giuen vnto it. The Prophet was notwithstanding praeserued, by the vnderstanding that God gaue him before of the danger that hee was in: and by the meanes that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon himselfe did vse to preuent it. Treating of the releefe it selfe which now soon after was giuen vnto it, it is first declared, how the Prophet did foreshow it: then, how it was performed vnto them. Fore-showed it was, vpon occasion of an impatient speach, deliuered by the Messenger, it seemeth, and to picke a quarrell vnto him, to do that which he had commanded with greater show of colour for it. The speach was, that the euill that then was on them, came from the Lorde: and therefore that <note place="margin">Ibid. 33.</note> now they were no longer to await any goodnesse of him. That occasion being of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, the Prophet then (putting vp the indignity of it) did plainely tell them (he had <note place="margin">2 King. 7: 1, 2</note> other company with him before, and by this time it appeareth by that which follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth, that the King himselfe was come and others with him) that by that time next day they should haue such plenty there, that a great personage that was in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany replied againe, that it was cleane beyond all possibility: but the Prophet neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse persisted therein; and farther told him, that himselfe should see it, but because <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> he did not beleeue it, he should not tast of it. A iudgement that in these daies also is cast on many, who in these daies of the Gospell, cannot but see the plentifulnes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, though themselues haue not the guift to make it theirs. Performed it was by the suddaine departure of the <hi>Syrians</hi> (hearing such a warlike noyce, and beeing so af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted <note place="margin">Ibid. 3-16.</note> with it, that they left their Camp and all thinges therein, and fled away for their liues withall the hast they were able to make) they leauing so great plenty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde them: but they got the first vnderstanding of it by certaine Leaprous persons who went to the Campe for some reliefe, and soone after brought word thereof to the Citty; and making thereof a farther triall, they found it to be so indeede. Of those Leapers it is farther declared, that first for a time they were altogether occupied in packing-vp for themselues, and did not praesently bring that glad newes to the Citty, who stood in great need to haue had it so soone as it might haue bin: but that feare of punnishment for that their lingering on priuate Lucre, did make them soone after to amend that fault of theirs. Many of ours that are called vnto the Ministery, ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much following the steps of those Leaders that were before vs, by immoderate thirst of priuate Lucre, are not so imployed as they ought to bee, in deliuering the glad ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of the Gospell to the people of God: and though it be sufficiently knowne, that iudgements heauy enough are prouided for those that are so defectine in that point of duty; yet neyther doth the remembrance thereof win them to sound amendment therein. But according to the word of the Prophet, both they had now such plenty <note place="margin">Ibid. 16-20.</note> indeede: and yet that great personage that did not beleeue, was himselfe neuer the better for it.</p>

The party by whom hee should haue his death, was one of his Captaines, whom God himselfe ordained to do that seruice, <hi>Iehu</hi> by name, first, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming him vnto <hi>Elias;</hi> but now setting him in hand with it by <hi>Eliseus.</hi> When hee named him first to <hi>Elias,</hi> it was, that he should go and annoint him King ouer <hi>Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 King. 16. 16</note> while yet King <hi>Ahab,</hi> this mans father, raigned in <hi>Israel:</hi> and that God willed him then to doo it, it seemeth, it was to comfort the Prophet then, being at that time in great discontentment, to see things go so ill as they did; but that it was not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> done by <hi>Elias</hi> then, it seemeth, it was for that <hi>Ahab</hi> a while after hauing those iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments denounced vnto him which God did now meane to bring on his yssue, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued <note place="margin">Ibid. 21: 21-24, 27-29.</note> some speciall sorrow thereon, and therefore God would for his time respite the same. Setting in hand with it by <hi>Eliseus</hi> now, wee haue more distinctly deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered vnto vs, first what was done by those, by whom it pleased God to signifie his will and pleasure for that matter: then, what it was that was done by others, vpon the vnderstanding thereof. Those whom it pleased God to vse there in to signifye his will and pleasure for that matter vnto him, were <hi>Eliseus</hi> himself: and one other of the children of the Prophets, called also (at least as it is conceiued) the seruant of the Prophet (for there be that do not so take it) whom the Prophet then sent vnto <note place="margin">

But whether the Lord himselfe did a-fresh set this man on worke therein; or whether <hi>Elias</hi> had left that direction with him, we haue not declared as also it may bee, that on that former sentence of God, himselfe did gather it; though one of the other seemeth to me to be the likelyer. The seruant of the Prophet, or that young Prophet went <note place="margin">Ibid. 4-10</note> and did accordingly: both in the maine point of the matter; and presently speed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himselfe away as he was commanded. The maine point of the matter was, that he both annointed him to be king of <hi>Israel:</hi> and that he shewed him what executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he should do on the house of <hi>Ahab,</hi> and what the Lorde had determined both on all that whole house of his, and on <hi>Iezebel</hi> withall; in all things agreeing to the <note place="margin">1 King. 21: 21-23.</note> words of the Lord by <hi>Elias</hi> before. Those others were the other Captaines, who were in company with <hi>Iehu,</hi> when this young Prophet came vnto him, and tooke him a-side to speake with him a-part by himselfe. Who, though at the first they <note place="margin">2 Kin. 9: 11-13</note> accounted this inferior Prophet but a mad fellow: yet when <hi>Iehu</hi> aquainted them with the businesse that he had with him; they most readily yeelded thereunto, and forth-with proclaimed him to be their King. In what sort <hi>Iehoram</hi> the king came to his death being now to be seene, when the party is fully prouided by whom hee should haue it, we haue noted vnto vs, what disaduantage was nowe against him: and how it was to his ouerthrow accordingly taken. The disaduantage that now <note place="margin">Ibid. 14, 15, <hi>&amp;</hi> 8: 29.</note>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> was against him, was, that he had an Army at <hi>Ramoth-Gilead;</hi> but himselfe was ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent lying in <hi>Iezreel,</hi> to be healed of certaine wounds which hee had gotten in his conflicts with the <hi>Syrians</hi> before. In that his army, it seemeth, by the Text, that <hi>Iehu</hi> was a Captaine of speciall reckoning, because the residue were so readye, on the occasion that then was giuen, to proclaime him King: but <hi>Iosephus</hi> conceiueth that hee was the Generall of all the Army; and then had his maister so much the <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Antiq. Iudaic. lib.</hi> 9. <hi>cap.</hi> 4.</note> greater disaduantage therein. The King himselfe likewise being absent from his Army then, about the curing of those his wounds, left his Captaines the readier op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to inflict a greater wound on him: and those former woundes of his, it may well be, by the ordinary course of Gods dealing with vs, were some speciall call vnto him, before this last stroke came to cut him off cleane. The King being in this disaduantage, and we being now to see how it was to his ouer-throw as rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily taken, when <hi>Iehu</hi> perceiued how ready the Captains were to haue him to take <note place="margin">2 King. 9: 16-24.</note> that honour vnto him, and (belike) the rather perceyuing that the Prophets mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage was of the Lord, when he saw these things to bee so suteable there-unto (his
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:7530:214"/> Maisters absence, the Captaines so willing, and sufficient forces at hand already) hee first tooke order that none should steppe out thence to carry worde what was to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes: and then, sped himselfe and his company a-pace to surprize the King, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee might haue any warning of it. The King on the other side hauing a watch, and vnderstanding thereby of a company comming a-pace towardes him, and sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding foorth twice to vnderstand the cause of their comming, but receiuing no aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere againe, and vnderstanding his Messengers were stayed, got himselfe ready so well as in that time hee could, to goe and meete them in forcible manner. At which time espying it to bee <hi>Iehu,</hi> he asked of him whether hee came in peaceable manner: but when <hi>Iehu</hi> replyed that he might looke for no peace, so great iniquity of his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther yet remaining vnpunnished, and withall (as it seemeth) making towardes him in hostile manner, hee then perceiued what the matter was, and fled; but there in his flight was quickly slaine, by <hi>Iehu</hi> himselfe, when he had raigned twelue yeares.</p>
            <p n="17">17 Such thinges as we haue of <hi>Elisha</hi> or <hi>Eliseus</hi> the Prophet apart by himselfe, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> nothing at all appertaining to the Story of the Kingdome, and comming within <note place="margin">Elisha.</note> the raigne of <hi>Iehoram</hi> of whom wee haue spoken, were most of them done within the Land: and some, without. Of those that were done within the Land, most of them were done to helpe, in some neede then praesently being: but one, to preuent an ill that was comming. Of those that were done to helpe in some neede then praesently being, one there is, of which we haue no mention where it should bee done: but of the others wee haue the place also something noted where they were done. That one, of which we haue no place noted, is of that poore Widdow, late wife to one of the Sonnes of the Prophets that feared God: seeking to the Prophet <note place="margin">2 King. 4: 1-7.</note> in her distresse; and miraculously holpen by him, by the increase of that little store of oyle she had left. Of those others of which we haue the place something noted where they were done, some there are of which the place where they were done is more certainely noted: and some againe, where we haue but likelihood of it. Of those that were done where the place is more certainely noted, one there is, which the Prophet did as of himselfe: others, wherein he was requested or sought vnto. Of himselfe we may account that to be done which he did at <hi>Sunem:</hi> and yet is it good to note withall, that hee accounted himselfe, after a sort, iustly prouoked vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <note place="margin">Ibid. 8-17.</note> it. For though he did many pleasures to diuers, according to the power where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he was endewed, miraculously: yet for the most part wee find not that he did such pleasures but when they were sought for, or otherwise himselfe saw some vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent occasion. Which also we may find in Christ himselfe, and in all the seruants of God generally, who haue beene in like sort endewed: a consideration good to teach vs to seeke for such help where God hath laid it vp for vs; and that otherwise we may want, when we are in the midst of plenty. The Prophet might account himselfe (after a sort) iustly prouoked vnto it, for that a woman of good reckoning there (for whom hee did it) was so carefull as shee was to giue him entertainment there, as he had occasion to passe-by that way: which it seemeth, hee often had, it standing in the way betwixt <hi>Carmell</hi> and <hi>Gilgal,</hi> and some other places whereunto he most repaired. That which the Prophet did heereupon, was, that being other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise carefull to haue done her any pleasure that he was able, when he vnderstoode that she stoode in no neede of his help any such way as he supposed she might, but <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> that indeed she had no child, &amp; her husband was old, he then obtained of the Lord that she might haue a Sonne, and assured her that so it should bee, in such like time from thence, as women were wont to conceiue and beare: as also at the time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed she had. In which Story it is good likewise to marke, both the wisedome of the Prophet, and the modesty of the woman; when as he dealt with her first but by his man, and then when she was to come in presence, yet then she stoode but in <note place="margin">Ibid. 13, 15.</note> the doore: a good example in them both to take good heede, not onely of euill it selfe; but also of all thinges whereon might breede suspition thereof. Vpon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest or seeking vnto, wee find that the Prophet did such thinges, first at <hi>Carmel:</hi>
               <pb n="407" facs="tcp:7530:214"/> then also, at <hi>Gilgall.</hi> But yet as touching the former of them, we may not properly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute the doing of the thing it selfe at <hi>Carmell:</hi> but onely that some part of it was don there; and that there he was when first the suit was moued vnto him. That which thus far we allot vnto <hi>Carmel,</hi> a Mountain neer to the sea side, in the Tribe of <hi>Issachar,</hi> was the restoring of that child to life againe, when in processe of time he sickned and <note place="margin">Ibid. 18-37.</note> died. In which Story it shall be good to note, what confidence the woman had in the Prophet: &amp; what it was the Prophet did to satisfie her desire therein. The confidence that the woman had in the Prophet was such, as that she laid hir dead child on his bed, <note place="margin">Ibid 18-28.</note> &amp; sped himselfe forthwith to the Prophet where he was at <hi>Carmel,</hi> no doubt for some help of him, euen in that case also. For had she had no hope that way, then she would haue imploied her selfe about his buriall: and vnlesse shee had had some hope in the Prophet, it is no way likely, that of al places in her house besides, she would haue made choice of his bed wheron to lay him. A good example of a notable reckoning of the seruants of God, euen in that rude age of the world: &amp; that where there was such re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the seruants of God, there was a wonderfull faith in God likewise, euen in death to looke for life. When she came to the Prophet, though in plaine tearmes she made not that suit vnto him: yet both the passion that then she was in, and the words which then she vttered did plainly imply it, that the Prophet himselfe so conceiued, as by that which praesently he did thereon appeareth. That therefore that the Prophet thereon did, was first assaied by his seruant: and soone after performed by himselfe. By his seruant, he first assaied to restore the child to life againe, as appeareth by the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere his seruant gaue him on the way, letting him vnderstand what he had done in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> that busines about which he had sent him. But in that his first assaying of it, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> did not praeuaile: belike to teach, both him and vs, that the mightiest Prophets that are, praeuaile but little in such matters, vnlesse they go about them in the best manner they can. And the woman (it is plain) did not leaue him thereon, but plainly protested, that (his seruant though he sent about it, yet) she would not leaue him so. It may be also, that God hath left this story to teach vs, that thogh in many cases there be good vse of Curates and Deputies, and that in such case the vse of thē is so needful, that in no wise it ought to be called in quaestion: yet we must take heed, that our selues do not shrink from the labour of our calling, vnder the cloake of vsing others therein, nor vse any such compendious waies to spare our own labour whensoeuer the case doth require it of vs. A point of duty, that though it be not vrged (lightly) but vnto the Ministery: yet is it as needfull, in their measure, for others also. But especially for the Minystery it is not amisse (for those to whom it appertaineth) to conceiue, that although such Homelies as we haue appointed, bee very good (euen the best Sermons, that for the most part we haue) and to speciall good aedifying to those that haue a reuerent regard vnto them: yet if any of vs haue that meaning, that we may otherwise imploy or take to our owne priuate vse, such Church-maintenance as God appointed, whereby an able Minister should be maintained, so that we leaue them Curates to read them Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, that may very well prooue, and ouer often dooth, no better than was that lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Prophetes staffe on the face of the Child, in stead of the Prophet him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe. But that good Woman beeing so importunate with him, that shee would not away without him (belike shee knewe, there was faire oddes betwixt the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet himselfe, and his Seruant) then went the Prophet himselfe praesently with her: not tarrying to see whether his Seruaunt had doone it or not (for hee met him by the way) but readyly yeelding that readyer helpe that in his owne praesence shee had conceiued; a very good patterne for many of ours likewise to followe. Bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come to the House, it is good to marke what hee dooth (not this at <hi>Carmell,</hi> but at <hi>Sunem</hi> now:) and all such to take our patternes hence, as are to giue life to such, as from whom it is departed; not onely of the Ministery, but euen of all others besides, euery of vs in our owne bounds and measure. That which he did, resteth in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> two principall points: one, seeking the help of God from aboue; the other, vsing his owne endeauour beneath. He sought the help of God from aboue, by prayer: and to <note place="margin">Ibid 32. 33.</note> the end he might the lesse be cumbred therein, he first shutteth the doore vnto him, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing but onely the Corps and himselfe within. Wherein it shall be good to mark, as
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:7530:215"/> first and chiefely, some-what as touching the substance of it: so then likewise, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what as touching the manner of it. As touching the substance of it, no more but this, that whensoeuer any of vs al are about to raise our selues or others from the bondage or death, or no more but from the sleep or slumber of sin, then are we first to consider, that it is not to be done, but only by the good grace and help of God: and therefore, that truly &amp; earnestly we seek vnto him for his help therein by prayer. As touching the manner of his doing it, we are sure that this man was plentifully endued with the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God: so that in reason wee may account, that his doing heerein may be a good patterne to vs to follow; and withall, a good rule whereby to try the spirit of others. For it is the manner of some, who also do seem to be touched with some special zeale, and to haue some earnest desire of reformation, neuerthelesse to haue no great care to pray for the same a-part by themselues: but to get such families, or such seueral per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, as they hope may be allured to be of the same bent with them (vnder the name of reformation, to vrge a needlesse and hurtfull innouation) &amp; then in their hearing, and leading them on to ioyne with them, to conceiue such praiers, as vnder the shew of confessing the deformities and wants of the praesent age or state, are indeed meere inuectiues against good orders established, and those very false and slanderous too. But these are euer out of their proper element, if they haue not others, whom vnder the name of some glorious prayer, and as it were by the force of it, they may lead far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than they are aware of vnto the other, and set them fast on it so neer as they can. There is good vse as the case may bee, and often is, of ioyning together in prayer, and of leading others therein: but some doe vse it for their owne glory, and to lead others in thier owne priuate and distempered humor; and it is good that that abuse be also noted. His owne endeuour that himselfe did vse beneath, was, that twice hee applyed himselfe, and many of his particular members, so well as hee could, to the youth deceased, so to get some warmth vnto him: the former of those two times so far praeuailing, that the flesh of the Childe now waxed warme, and reuied at the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> the Prophet himselfe leauing a space betwixt, as also it is good that we in such actions be not importunate with any, but that after some time of instruction or exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, we leaue some time of aduisement vnto them. So in the end hee deliuered the Child aliue to his Mother: and we, in our case, might very well hope of the like effect <note place="margin">Ibid. 36, 37</note> in the end, if truly we vsed like means vnto it. That which the Prophet did at <hi>Gilgal,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ibid. 38-41.</note> was, that miraculously he alaied or tooke away such a bitternesse from meat prouided for many to feede on, as imported all the meat to be poysoned by an hearb ignorant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly put in: not causing it to be cast away, and myraculously prouiding other; but vsing that (a matter worth the noting too) which God had already prouided, and correc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the hurtfulnesse of it. Those of which we haue but probability onely where they were done, were, one of them on the behalfe of many: and two of them about two seuerall persons. And the place where it seemeth these were done, was <hi>Gilgal,</hi> the place last aboue mentioned. For as touching the first of these three, the particular whereby it is coupled vnto the other before, though diuersly interpreted, yet stil doth seeme to note, the former place last before mentioned to be the place where this also was done: and both the others note the place to be (by likelyhood) neere vnto <hi>Ior<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan;</hi> and so was <hi>Gilgal</hi> that now we speake of. That which was done on behalfe of <note place="margin">Ibid 42-44.</note> many, was that with smal prouision brought him, he fed many, clean beyond the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of those that were priuy vnto it. Those seueral persons were, one of them, a stranger: the other, one of that people.</p>
            <p n="18">18 That which is of the stranger, is that of <hi>Naaman,</hi> a Noble Man of <hi>Syria,</hi> and of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
               <note place="margin">2. King. 5: 1.</note> great reckoning with his Prince: and the effect of it is, how, he being a leprous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, that disease of his was miraculously taken off from him by the Prophet: and by the same Prophet as miraculously laid on another. In that part of the Story that shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth how the Leprosie was taken off from him, wee haue noted vnto vs, first how hee got vnderstanding, that <hi>Eliseus</hi> the Prophet in <hi>Israell</hi> was likely to heale him of it: then, how he got to be cured of him. He heard of it by a little wench of the <hi>Israelites,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ibid. 2, 3.</note> who in the time of Hostility had beene taken out of her owne Countrey, and at that time serued <hi>Naamans</hi> Wife: she telling her Mistris, that if her Lord and Maister were
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:7530:215"/> with the Prophet in <hi>Israell</hi> he might there bee cured of his Leprosie; and shee letting her Husband vnderstand, what comfort therein her Maid had giuen her. To get him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe cured of him, first he obtained the Kings letters: then, he went about it himselfe. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> The Kings letters he obtained vppon the report of that Seruant of his: yet not to the <note place="margin">Ibid. 4, 5.</note> Prophet, but vnto the King himselfe; but imperiously enough, commanding him to cure that his seruant of his Leprosie. A foule shame to al <hi>Israel</hi> generally, that a wench could make that reckoning of the Prophet, that her Mistris, Maister, &amp; the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, all Heathen folke, could giue that credit thereunto: and yet the Prophet to bee so little regarded of his owne people: not only of the baser sort of them, but euen of those that should most haue done it. When himself went about it, he made (as it were) two assaies of it: himselfe marring all in the former; but then speeding very wel in the latter. In the former also, for a time hee did very well: but afterward ouerthrew it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. He did well, both in setting forth in such sort as he did: and holding on the like course when he was in the land of <hi>Israell.</hi> In his setting forth, we find that he came so <note place="margin">Ibid. 5.</note> furnished, with such store of treasure and things of price, as that it seemeth he meant the Prophet some very special and great reward: and the greater he intended his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward should be, the better regard it sheweth he had of him before he came forth; and the more thankfull that he would be, when he had been so holpen by him. For mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable prouision, and miserable rewarding of benefits receiued, do both of them argue, but a miserable regard of the parties by whom wee are holpen, and as miserable a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luing the benefit it selfe. When he was in the land of Israel he held on his course well, first to the King: then, when he was dismissed from him. Being come to the King, he found, that when he had deliuered his Lords letter vnto him, he was in such a passion <note place="margin">Ibid 6, 7.</note> or perturbation of minde, as might sufficiently of it selfe witnesse (without any thing else to help it) that the King knew not he had any such Prophet, of whom hee might hope so far to be holpen: and then, if the King himselfe did not know any such, what might this stranger thinke of his iourney, who had come so far to seek to such a one, as was so obscure among his owne people? When hee was dismissed from the King, <note place="margin">Ibid. 8, 9.</note> albeit he had discouragement enough there to go any farther, yet when there he vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood who it was to whom he was to repaire, he goeth on thyther: and there hee awayteth, with all his traine, at the doores of the Prophet. Hitherto hauing doone well, now he ouerthrew all againe, in that the Prophet did but send him word <note place="margin">Ibid. 10-12.</note> what he should doe, and did not himselfe come foorth vnto him: thereuppon tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> his course, and going away thence in displeasure. And wee see by often ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, that great men are so vsed to much attendance, that whatsoeuer reuerend regard they haue of the Prophet, euen whom they like best of all others: yet euen of those also must they haue such attendaunce, as neyther becommeth the one to looke for, nor the other to yeelde; and argueth withall, but vaine ostentation in the one, and an abiect and base minde in the other, conforming themselues to the lusts of Men, on hope of aduantage. And seeing the Prophet did so vse his liberty then, and that neyther in Pride not Vanity: such freedome may be vsed sometimes of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Seruants of God likewise, and they neuerthelesse not to bee hardly censured for it. The greater that God is (beyonde all comparison) than any other earthly Potentate whatsoeuer, the more should the oddes, that men of worship when they repaire to the honourable, and the honourable themselues when they repaire to their Princes Courts, do find for such matter as now we speake of, betwixt themselues and much meaner persons there, &amp; are faine to brook it too, sufficiently teach, how little cause such <hi>Naamans</hi> haue to find themselues so much grieued, if in such an earthly expectation they find themselues, in some of the best seruants of the higher God, now &amp; then deceiued. In the latter of those his assaies we haue set down, not onely what it was: but withall, in what sort he tooke it, that hee sped so well therein. That his second assay it selfe we may account to be, when those that did attend him then, did <note place="margin">Ibid. 13, 14.</note> in dutifull manner perswade with him, to doe as the Prophet had sent him word to doe: and he, thereon yeelding vnto them, did so indeede. For then he was cleane cured of his disease, and had the full end of his desire. A good place to put great men in minde, to haue meete attendantes about them, such as will not sticke to
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:7530:216"/> warne them as occasion is offered; and, that themselues doe euer allow them so to do: especially, in all such thinges as wherein they haue the seruants of God concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring; and to that end euer to nourish in them a dutifull regard of those that are of that profession. We haue had and professed the Gospell long, and yet it may be it were hard to find many great personages among vs that haue such attendants, as if they should see their Lord and Maister in needlesse displeasure with some of that calling, would be so carefull to weigh him to a moderate course: but ouer many, that in such case would open their mouths wide against them; and be ready enough to passe their bounds otherwise too, in much greater and fuller measure. In what <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> sort he tooke it, that he sped so well therein, we haue deliuered vnto vs, in that part of his dealing which afterward hee had with the Prophet: and that was, partly on behalfe of the Prophet himselfe; and partly on behalfe of God. Of that which was on behalfe of the Prophet, some part of it is out of question: but other some, not. Out of quaestion it is, that hee returned vnto him, and would haue bestowed a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward vpon him, but that the Prophet would in no wise take it. That which is in quaestion, <note place="margin">Ibid. 15. 16.</note> is that which followeth immediately after, when hee father vrgeth the Prophet, about two Mules-load of that earth to bee giuen to his seruant. Which (doubtlesse) may be well vnderstood, as if the meaning of <hi>Naaman</hi> were, to obtain of the Prophet, that with his fauour hee might leaue the load of two Mules of such <note place="margin">Ibid. 17.</note> thinges as he had brought with him to bestow vpon him, with his seruant that did attend him: that so the Prophet might hold on his own course, himselfe not to take it; and yet might haue a great stroke in it when his seruant had it. For it is an vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all manner of men (as wee may see in those that attend Princes, or any other great personages, &amp; are in credit or fauour with them, in Officers of Courts likewise, and in many others that haue the like oppertunities, and can be content to bee conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, though themselues will not seeme to take any thing) to haue some of their ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants Catechized before to such a purpose: and of such as would seeme thankfull vnto them, not so much to vrge it vnto themselues, as to seeme to haue no farther meaning, but onely to gratifie their seruants with it. Insomuch that <hi>Salomon</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth <note place="margin">Prou. 11: 14.</note> secrecy to be the manner of considering such; and that, if that course be obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, it mightily praeuaileth with all that are of that sort of takers: but withall, that they are wicked men, that do make such sale of their fauour. That in this sense he <note place="margin">Ibid. 17: 23</note> should call that his Treasure, those his Iewels and Ornaments that he brought with him, but earth, that also is no new thing, when as not onely men generally are ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med earth and ashes: but euen a King himselfe, a principall personage among men, <note place="margin">Ecclu. 10: 12. 17: 33.

Concerning which, although it were no necessary argument, that seeing he could leaue none of those things with the Prophet that hee brought to bestow vpon him, hee had yet no Mules empty to carry any such matter away with him (which notwitstanding hee might haue had, if he could haue left those things with the Prophet which he meant vnto him:) yet is it altogether as strong, for any thing that I do see to the contrary, as is that their opinion which they haue heereof conceiued. Two things there be, that may seeme to haue haue induced them vnto it: one, that the vulgar translation doth plainly set downe, that himselfe was that seruant of the Prophet that there hee spake off; the other, that immediately after he protesteth, that thenceforward he will not sacrifice to any other Gods, but onely to the Lord.

In that hee protesteth so of his sacrificing from that time for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, that also may bee, to the ende hee would haue had the Prophet to haue taken those thinges at his handes: conceiuing that the Prophet would so much the rather haue done it, if he might perceiue that he did not remaine so Heathenish and Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> as he was before (in which case the Prophet, hee conceiued, might not in any reason communicate so farre with him) but that now he would professe and worship the selfe-same God, that the Prophet himselfe did worship. Neuerthelesse, it is not to be denyed, but that a man so lately touched with any knowledge of God, and so ignorant yet as he was, might well be so farre conceited to haue of the earth of that Land to such purpose as is conceiued of them: but that other sense doe I thinke to be a great deale the likelier of the two, to be the meaning of the Text aforesand. That which was on behalfe of God, was part of it very commendable: part of it again, iust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reproueable. Commendable it was, that he then protested that thenceforward he <note place="margin">2. King. 5: 17.</note> would worship none other God, but onely the Lord. In that which was iustly repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uable, we haue not only noted vnto vs, what it was: but withal, how the Prophet dealt with him in it. It was no more but this, that hauing the testimony of his owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, <note place="margin">Ibid. 18.</note> that there was no other God but onely the Lord; yet neuerthelesse he did not meane, altogether to with-draw him-selfe from the semblance or outward shew of worshipping others, when as other-wise it might haue impared his fauour with the King: but yet, in that case, he desired God to be mercifull vnto him.

Yet therin also it is good to mark, that as he, not inquiring of the prophet, what in such case he was to do, but ouer-ruling it vnto himselfe, had no direction of the Prophet therein: so, if we will not inquire, but walk in the glimmering of our owne light, we likewise deserue to be dismissed without instruction, to noddle on forward as our selues thinke good. In that other part of the Story, that sheweth how the Leprosie was layd on another, whereas it was <hi>Gihezay</hi> the Prophets own man on whom it was laid, because the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of this one circumstance dooth very probably imply, that there was some great fault in him, therefore wee are more distinctly to consider, first of the fault that he did make: then, of the punishment that for the same was laide vpon him. His fault was, that whereas his Mayster had refused those thinges, that <hi>Naaman</hi> hadde <note place="margin">Ibid. 19-24.</note>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> brought to bestow vppon him, hee first resolued that he would runne after him, and take some-thing of him: and accordingly (in his Maysters name) did so indeed, two talents of Siluer, and two change of Garments; the Noble Gentleman very readily yeelding thereto and causing two of his Seruants to carry them home with him. This was the fault for which he was punnished: but this was not all. For it is the manner of sin to engender sinne: and of one fault, to draw in another. For being returned, and his Maister asking him, where he had bin, he told his Maister he had gon no whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: and so, while hee was desirous to couer his fault in that matter, hee made a <note place="margin">Ibid. 25. 26.</note> plaine lye vnto his Mayster. The punishment that for the same was laide vpon him, had a kind of conuiction, or at least a reproofe going before: and then, the punnish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it selfe. The conuiction or reproofe was, first, but as touching that praesent lye that then hee made: but then, as touching his maine fault, which thereby hee
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:7530:217"/> would haue couered. As touching that his lye that then he made, hee did no more but charge him with it: giuing him a plaine token, that the truth of that matter was not vnknowne vnto him. As touching his maine fault, which thereby hee would haue concred, his Mayster dooth aske him, whither it were a time then, so to bee on the taking hand: playnely implying thereby, that it was not. But why it was no time then, as it is altogether omitted by some: so it is not sufficiently examined by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers <note place="margin">Lyr, Conr, Pell. Tremel.

For I doe not finde, that there is any farther matter thereof conceiued, why he should not then haue taken any thing of <hi>Naaman,</hi> but onely, as one supposeth, because he was not of their Religion, but a stranger therein <note place="margin">Fra.

But it <note place="margin">Pet. Mart<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r.</note> seemeth to me, that the Prophet hath not respect so much to eyther of these, as to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other that toucheth much neerer: but yet, that if wee doe not well marke what his fault was, wee also may easily misse it. His fault therefore was but onely in that his taking (for his Mayster doth not, in his punishment it selfe, charge him, eyther with going vnto <hi>Naaman</hi> in his name, or with his lying when he returned; but only, that the time was not then to be taking) but then are wee to consider, that it was not sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply but taking, as when a thing is offered first: but first a resolution with himselfe, that he would get some-what of him; and then speeding himselfe accordingly for it. The time that hee speaketh of, must eyther haue relation to that time then, in some speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> respect to it appertaining: or else to be taken generally, so as concerned not that time onely, but all others at any time whatsoeuer. If he should meane of that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry time that then hee spake of, in some speciall respect to it appertayning, I see not what other might be conceiued, but eyther as thinges had passed then among them: or else, as it stood with the estate of the whole Church or people then. As thinges had passed then among them, it is very plain that his Maister had refused those things before: and so, that it had becommed the Seruant better, to haue abidden in the same course still with his Mayster. But seeing his Mayster dooth not charge him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, we finde lesse reason why we should doe it. As it stood with the estate of the whole Church or people then, this beeing in the dayes of <hi>Iehoram,</hi> it were not easie to finde, when the people were in better estate generally: he not being so corrupt in Religion as his Father and Brother were, and hauing so good successe against the <hi>Moabites,</hi> and against the <hi>Syrians</hi> twice, as we saw before that he had. For though <hi>Iehu</hi> afterward praeuailed against him, yet was that but in a moment, and in the last end of his raigne: which calamity also went no farther, but onely to him and others of his stocke: and not vnto the rest of the people. So it seemeth, that it was but a generall respect that the Prophet had to the time, such as concerneth all times else generally: as giuing him to vnderstand, that now (while wee liue heere) wee should attend better matters, than to runne after the thinges of this World: not onely Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets themselues; but euen theyr attendants also, and then all other sortes of people generally. And true it is, that as touching our earthly estate heere, wee should not couet, or so much as in heart desire any better estate for those matters, than it hath pleased God already to giue vs, or from time to time shall giue vs hereafter: but that we should gather all our affections and desires, onely vnto the seruice of God, and to such things as do appertaine to his glory. So that indeed the Prophet might well say, that this is no time to seeke after such matters: but to make our Seed-time of such thinges now, as we would be gladdest hereafter to reape. The punishment it selfe <note place="margin">Ibid. 27.</note> was, that the Leprosie of <hi>Naaman</hi> should cleaue vnto him and to his Seed: and that it should be to them incurable, or that they should neuer get remedy for it.

A Story sufficient by it selfe to shew, that they were a poore company (but carefull withall of that they had bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed) when so small a losse as that did touch them so neere (whereas if other men could worke Myracles, some good estate in earthly thinges would be one of the first Myracles that they would worke:) and yet withall, that God vouchsafed that extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary power of his to bee so plentifull in his Prophet among them, as that euen in those small matters also they should bee holpen, euen by that precious (and the same very glorious) kinde of supply. That one thing that this our Prophet did, to prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent an ill which then was comming, hath besides the thing it selfe, another matter thereunto appertaining. The thing it selfe was, that he gaue the <hi>Shunamite</hi> warning <note place="margin">2.

A case of experience, that the secret of the Lorde is among the faithfull: and, that first he prouideth for his, before hee poure foorth his wrath on others. That other <note place="margin">Ibid. 3-6.</note> matter thereunto appertaining, is an example of the prouidence of God, so disposing on behalfe of the <hi>Shunamite,</hi> that when shee was returned againe, and was faine to goe to the King for her House and Land, whereinto others had gotten in that her absence, and held her from it now: euen againe rhat very time was the King in such communication of her, and that of his owne desire too, as mooued him to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund right to bee done her with great fauour. And wee likewise are neuer to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> doubt of the fauour of God towardes vs (in the way of his calling) though yet wee see no appearance of it: he euer hauing it in a readinesse, against the time that wee shall neede it, and euer (for the most part) keeping it close till then. Those that were done without the Land, were such as passed betweene <hi>Hazaell,</hi> a great man in <hi>Syria,</hi> and this our Prophet at <hi>Damascus,</hi> the head Citty of <hi>Syria;</hi> one, as touching <hi>Benhadad,</hi> the King then; the other, as touching <hi>Hazael</hi> himselfe, that nowe wee speake off.

               <note place="margin">Ibid. 7.</note> and the King hearing that he was come thither, he thought good, beeing at that time sicke, to send vnto him, to know whether hee should recouer, or not: and it shall bee good for vs therein to consider, first, in what manner the King sent vnto him; then, what aunswere the Prophet giueth. When the King sent vnto him about <note place="margin">Ibid. 8, 9.</note> it though he were but an Heathenish man, and had beene a great Enemy to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God: yet hath he that regard to this Seruant of God, that he sent him of the best thinges the Countrey yeelded, the burden of forty Camels for a praesent.

But so farre as I see, nothing letteth, but that wee may take the Prophets meaninig to bee, as his wordes are, notwithstanding, that the euent did not so fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low: namely, that hee should recouer, the Prophet beeing no farther inquired for, but onely as touching that his sicknesse; and the Prophet making no aunswere but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 word">

<pb n="414" facs="tcp:7530:218"/> vnto him. So that although hee perished the next day after, and that then hee was not as yet recouered: yet that then hee perished, it was not by his sicknesse where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Prophet was inquired; but by the forcible dealing of others, and so not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the truth of the Prophets answere. Which I thinke so much the rather meete to be noted, because that some (belike to salue the matter the better, in respect of the euent that followed) haue made both the answere and the quaestion too, to go vpon <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>

Which notwithstanding is no way needful, if we conceiue the Prophet to go no further, but onely to that his sicknes, according as the question was to him propounded: as it may well bee, that himselfe also was ignorant, that death should otherwise seaze vpon him so soone as it did; and though hee were not, yet leaueth it his praediction, in the bounds of the question, full and true. As touching <hi>Hazaell,</hi> by whom the Prophet returned his answere (the selfe same party that now had brought the quaestion vnto him) wee haue not onely such dealing as passed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Prophet and him: but some other things withall which soone after ensued thereon, and are, in their kinde some part of this Story. Such dealing as passed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Prophet and him, was first, some farther matter as touching his Maister: the residue then, as touching himselfe. As touching his Maister, after that he had giuen him a direct answere to the quaestion that he had brought him, willing him to tell his Maister hee should recouer, then hee telleth him, that neuerthelesse the Lorde had <note place="margin">Ibid. 10.</note> shewed him that he should surely die: a couple of speeches, that may easily seeme to crosse one another, vnlesse they be rightly referred to their owne proper places; but being so referred, leauing no doubt, but that both may well stand together. As tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching himselfe, the Prophet doth very pregnantly shew him, that he should doe very much euill: and then, when himselfe made quaestion of it, he shewed him farther, what opportunity he should afterward haue, whereby hee might readily come to doe such thinges indeede. When he doth but onely shew him, that he should do very much euill, first he maketh a way thereunto by his deede: and after explaineth the same by his word. His deede was, that praesently thereupon he fell, as it were, into a deepe <note place="margin">Ibid. 11. <hi>Ari. Montan. Bibl. Angl.</hi>
               </note> muse: and therein did both shame with somewhat (for the originall doth not ascribe th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> shame vnto <hi>Hazael,</hi> as some haue conceiued;) and fell a weeping. He explained the same by his word, when <hi>Hazaell,</hi> espying that the Prophet wept, asked him (cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him his Lord; and there may be foule thinges in the handes of those that haue a kind of reuerence to the seruants of God) wherefore he wept: telling him then, that he foresaw that he should do outrageous and barberous cruelty against the <hi>Israelites.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ibid. 12.</note> He shewed him farther, what opportunity hee should afterward haue, whereby hee might come to doe such thinges indeede, when as hee seemed vtterly to detest, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
               <note place="margin">Ibid. 13.</note> such barbarity should euer bee found in him: the Prophet then telling him, that hee should be King of <hi>Syria.</hi> Those other thinges that we haue set downe withall, which soone after ensued thereon, and are in their kinde part of this Story, are two: one, how he discharged himselfe of this his businesse; the other, in what sort hee farther dealt with his Lord &amp; Maister. Of this his businesse he discharged himselfe but indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently: <note place="margin">Ibid. 14.</note> telling the King but onely in what case he stood as touching his sicknesse; nothing at all acquainting him, in what danger of death he otherwise stoode, which the Prophet had as plainly told him. His farther dealing with his Lord and Maister was, that the next day after he bereft him of his life, and withall possessed himselfe of <note place="margin">Ibid. 15.</note> his Kingdome: making the more speede belike therein, least he should recouer, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as the Prophet had said that he should; wheras now, if he tooke him in time, he might seeme to haue died of that his sicknesse, and himselfe neuer bee brought in question for it. So immoderat a desire had he, presently to step vnto the Kingdome, after that once he vnderstood, that in time he was to come vnto it: a plaine example of that bad property in vs, that if any way wee vnderstand our selues to be marked to any speciall place, thenceforward we are euer working inordinately to come vnto it; and though therein we see a ready downfall before vs to all manner of euill (as this man did, and whereby he should become, by his owne confession, as bad as a Dog) <note place="margin">Ibid. 13.</note> yet no whit at all for that to shunne it.</p>

            <p n="1">1 <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He latter of those that God himselfe appointed, was <hi>Iehu,</hi> of whom we haue heard some-what already: namely, how beeing set-vp on <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> the suddaine, he came so suddenly on his Lord and Maister, <hi>Ieho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram</hi>

So being a little before by God thereunto appointed, and nowe in actuall possession of the kingdome of <hi>Israel,</hi> we are to consider of his Story therein. Where first it shall be good to remember, that whereas in the Story of <hi>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ram</hi> before, we heard that wee had not all the residue of the Story of <hi>Elisha</hi> or <hi>Eliseus,</hi> for that hee out-liued the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> raigne of <hi>Iehoram:</hi> so haue we not the residue of his Story in the raigne of this king neither, nor of his sonne; but then in the raigne of his Sonnes sonne wee haue it. And yet though we haue no part of his Story heere, it shall not be amisse to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der euen of that point also: namely, that neither in the Story of <hi>Iehu,</hi> nor of his Sonne, we haue any mention of the Prophet that now wee speake of, though hee out-liued the raigne of them both. First, therefore of the Kinges themselues: then, that this Prophet is not in their Story remembred. Of the Kings themselues <hi>Iehu</hi> is the former of them: but then we are not to consider of these two onely, but seeing he had moe Sons also that came to the Crowne, of those likewise, and not only of him and his line: but of the residue of those kings that after him succeeded. But first of him and his line, then of the others: and againe, first of himselfe, and that sonne of his, who was within the time of this Prophet; then of those that came after. Of <hi>Iesu</hi> himselfe, it shall bee good, first to cast our eyes but onely to him: but then to come to our selues withall. Casting our eyes but onely to him, it shall bee good to marke, first what his wayes were: then, in what liking it may seeme they were with the Lord. As touching his wayes, we find him not liked but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in some, and disliked in others. To begin first with those wherein there was li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king conceiued of him, he is noted to haue raigned a good time, namely eight and <note place="margin">2. King. 10: 36</note> twenty yeares: and yet haue wee no Story of him (for these matters) but onely of that, which part of it vndoubtedly was, and the residue seemeth to bee, in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of his raigne. Which Story of his, is, first where he began this his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; then, in a few other places besides. We may then account, that he began his kingdome, when he ouer-threw and slew his Maister in the field, which was at <hi>Iesreel,</hi> where <hi>Iehoram</hi> the King lay to be cured of his woundes, which at <hi>Ramoth-Gilead</hi> he had receyued of the <hi>Syrians:</hi> where, whether first he prosecuted his vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, till he had smitten <hi>Ahaziah</hi> too, as hee was flying from him: and then tooke order for <hi>Iehorams</hi> body, or contrary-wise it is, so farre as I see, a matter of quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion. For by the Text heere it is plaine, that we haue it first noted, that he tooke <note place="margin">2. Kin. 9: 25, 26</note> order for <hi>Iehorams</hi> body, to be cast in that parcell of ground, which before had bin the Vineyard of <hi>Naboth:</hi> thereby to fulfill the word of the Lord, in that point, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore deliuered by the Prophet <hi>Elias.</hi> But it is saide withall, that when <hi>Ahaziah</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ibid. 27, 28.</note> vpon the discomfiture and death of <hi>Iehoram</hi> fled, <hi>Iehu</hi> pursued after, crying to his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Souldiers to strike him also, and that so they did, naming with all the place there, and telling besides, that soone after hee dyed at <hi>Megiddo,</hi> a little from the place where hee was wounded, and that his Seruants carried him thence to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> there to bury him. Yet in another place this Story of his death is so reported, as <note place="margin">2. Chr. 22: 9. Ibid 8.</note> if he were some-time after the battell hid in <hi>Samaria,</hi> and after the death of those Princes of <hi>Iudah,</hi> brought forth to <hi>Iehu</hi> from where he was hid, and then slayne.

Where also one of the places is mistaken by some: being taken to be in the Tribe of <hi>Iuda,</hi> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as it was in the Tribe of <hi>Manasses.</hi> But whether this (of the pursuit of <hi>Ahaziah,</hi> who also is called <hi>Azariah)</hi> were before or after that order taken for the body of <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horam</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. King. 9: 28. 2.

Of those that are set downe more specially, we haue two thinges re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded of him: one, concerning <hi>Iezebell;</hi> the other, concerning the sonnes of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hab.</hi> Concerning <hi>Iezebel,</hi> the effect is no more but her death; and that according to the word of the Lord: but more specially it is good to marke, both how by the <note place="margin">2. King. 9: 30-37.</note> prouidence of God shee should then shew herselfe vnto him, and others should bee ready at his commandement to tumble her downe; and how shee, a bad woman be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, now when her end was so neere vnto her, and that in so bloody manner as it was, was neuerthelesse so vainely occupied in painting her face and tyring her head, to be anon of a sort of Curs so cleane deuoured, so trimming-up that Dogs-meate then, as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> many of vs trim-up or pamper such wormes-meate now. Concerning the Sonnes <note place="margin">Ibid. 10: 1-10</note> or Issue of <hi>Achab,</hi> though they were many, and so he had hope of a goodly posterity: yet no sooner did <hi>Iehu</hi> set in hand to ouer-throw them, but that most readily it was performed; and by the handes of those with whom they were left for their strongest Guard. A good example to shew, that when mighty men begin to pull down others, then do they so vndermine their owne estates withall, that they are in no wise able to stand, whatsoeuer their owne forces may be, or what prouision soeuer they can make for their Issue succeeding. Those that are set downe but generally, are, that he did execution on all that pertained to <hi>Ahab:</hi> such as were either of any speciall recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <note place="margin">Ibid. 11.</note> with him; or but his Priestes in that Idolatrous seruice of his. A sufficient pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne likewise (for those that were his Familiars, or great with him) that God maketh no other reckoning of those that are great or familiar with bad men (though by their greatnesse they might otherwise be beneficiall to all their followers) than as of bad men themselues: and that although hee do not alwaies execute such iudgements on them: yet by this and such like he declareth, what in his iustice is due vnto them. And lesse maruell, when as euen experience it selfe so commonly teacheth, that there is no good will nor liking neither on the one side nor on the other, but onely among such as are of like disposition and waies. So that we may easily conceiue, that neither that <hi>Ahab</hi> before, nor any of our latter <hi>Ahabs</hi> since, would neuer suffer those to bee great nor familiar with them, that at any time misliked either his Idoll worshipping, or either his consenting-to, or his dames oppressing of <hi>Nahoth</hi> for his Vine-yard: and though they bee able, mightily to benefite those that doe attend them, yet are there none of good disposition indeede, or that haue any sound integrity, that so much as desire to be great or familiar with them. Those few places besides, were but two: one, in the way as he went from hence to <hi>Samaria;</hi> the other, at <hi>Samaria</hi> it selfe. In the way he met with certaine of whom we haue some Story: first, a great company; then, one person. That company was of two and fourty, all of the blood <note place="margin">Ibid. 12-14</note> or alliance of <hi>Ahaziah</hi> King of <hi>Iudah</hi> lately slaine, and by that alliance hee had with the house of <hi>Ahab,</hi> of that line also, and so of the number of those, on whom <hi>Iehu</hi>
               <pb n="411" facs="tcp:7530:219"/> had to do execution: which also presently he did, not sparing any of them. That <note place="margin">Ibid. 15, 16.</note> one person was <hi>Ionadab</hi> the sonne of <hi>Recab,</hi> one, it seemeth, that <hi>Iehu</hi> thought wel <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> of at this present: and afterward we haue father mention of him, as of one that was a rare man indeede. To him he imparted generally, that he had on the Lords be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe an intent of some speciall seruice: and withall tooke him vp into his Charriot with him vnto <hi>Samaria,</hi> there to be partaker of it. Comming to <hi>Samaria,</hi> first hee finisheth a businesse he had in hand before: then, he setteth in hand with a newe. That which he had in hand before, was the vtter destruction of <hi>Ahabs</hi> house, or to root out the whole race of him from the face of the earth: and therein he diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">Ibid. 17. Ibid. 18-27.</note> employed himselfe, and was the first thing that hee did when hee came thither. The other was, as it seemeth, not onely proper to that one place: but enlarged to diuers others besides. That which was proper to that one place, was, that hee <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>igned he would be a great worshipper of <hi>Baal,</hi> and farre exceede <hi>Achab</hi> therein; and that at that present he had a great Sacrifice vnto him: commending therefore, both the solemnity thereof to be published; and that all the Priests, Prophets, and Seruants of <hi>Baal</hi> should come in and attend their busines to helpe forwarde the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity and seruice of it on paine of death. But when he had by that meanes got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten them altogether, and set them a-worke about their businesse (first commanding thēselues to see to it, that there were none of the seruants of the Lord with them, as acounting that the presence of any of thē would be great pollution vnto the seruice they had in hand) he then setting a strong guard without, sent in others to do exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution on them all within, and gaue special charge that none should escape on pain of death. Which when they had done, then they destroyed the Images also, and made the house of <hi>Baal</hi> it selfe, in detestation of it, a common priuy. That which was enlarged to diuers others besides (at least as it is conceiued by some, and is much fauoured by the Text it selfe) is, that hauing thus begunne there, they went thence to euery other Citty also, where there was any Temple of <hi>Baal,</hi> and did so to the Images and Temples there, as they had done at <hi>Samaria</hi> before. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides that it is the iudgement of some, that this is the meaning of that place, both <note place="margin">Pet. Martyr. Tremel. Iun.

               </note> not a necessary consequence, that though he had gathered the Priests &amp; Prophets and al other seruants of <hi>Baal</hi> at that time vnto <hi>Samaria,</hi> yet were the places else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> remaining, and to be suppressed as was the other. For as for any other Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty neere to <hi>Samaria,</hi> which peculiarly should be meant by this, as some haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, I see not yet how that may be iustified: such as haue written of that argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <note place="margin">Fra.

Comming now to our selues, withall it shall bee good that first wee marke well whether we be not in our waies much like to <hi>Iehu:</hi> and if wee be, then eyther to cast to amend, or else to feare the like iudgements also.

To our aduantage it is, when we reape any benefite by it, as some slight in weight, or measure, vanity of speach, or such like in selling: especially if it bee the stay of our mainteinance, as Vsury, the keeping of gaming or Brothel-houses, and extorting by Office or opportunity of the place that they haue for expedition, is vnto many.

For his Father began his seauenteene yeares raign, <note place="margin">1 kin. 13: 1, 10</note> in the three and twentieth yeare of <hi>Ioash</hi> King of <hi>Iudah;</hi> and himselfe his sixeteene yeares raigne, in the seauen and thirtieth of the same King of <hi>Iudah</hi> aforesaide: so leauing but fourteene yeares to his Father to raigne alone, before that he also came <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> to the Kingdome. And true it is, that this <hi>Iehoash</hi> did valiantly against the <hi>Syri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans:</hi> but, because we do not reade, that hee did any thing till after the death of his Father; and seeing that the deliuerance that is spoken of heere, is concluded to haue beene somewhat within his Fathers raigne (for that it is so plainely noted, that neuerthelesse they departed not from their former sinnes, and had a Groue yet stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <note place="margin">Ibid. 6.</note> in <hi>Samaria</hi> it selfe) therefore it seemeth it is not cleere that it was by his Son, but some other rather, which we haue not in particular deliuered vnto vs. For as
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:7530:221"/> for the Angel that is conceiued, by the second opinion to haue bin peculiar to the land of <hi>Israell,</hi> and that this deliuerance should bee by him, that is of no more certainety than the other: and so, as it seemeth, the safest i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> hold, that the deliuerer spoken of heere, was such as it pleased God then to vse; but not to appropriate it to either of these. The reason wherefore the Lord did so help them, is giuen to be, for that he saw <note place="margin">Ibid. 4, 23.</note> the trouble in which they were by the K. of <hi>Syria:</hi> whereunto also it seemeth may be laid (for that also is the opinion of those before alleadged) that which is a little after <note place="margin">Ibid. 7.</note> more specially set downe, that in those daies they were brought so low, that they had but fifty horsemen, ten Charets, &amp; ten thousand footmen; the K. of <hi>Aram</hi> hauing so destroied them, and made them like dust beaten to pouder. Neuerthelesse it seemeth to me, that the Hebrew particle which doth seem to giue it that way, may be so inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted <note place="margin">Sant.

That the deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance which they receiued was but little regarded, is very plaine, for that they are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, not to haue departed from their former sins, but still to haue walked in them: and <note place="margin">Ibid. 6.</note> for that there was that groue yet remaining euen in <hi>Samaria.</hi> That <hi>Eliseus</hi> the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet (<note place="margin">Elisha forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten 40 yeeres together</note> whom we noted before, not to be reēmbred in the Story of either of these two kings) was now at least these forty years together, so little, either emploied by God, or regarded by mē, is first a thing very strange in it self: but then yeeldeth it good instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction withall. It is a thing strange in it selfe, that a man of so great power as hee, to whom one of the kinges might account himselfe so much beholding (he hauing sent to annoint him king) and to whom the other (so distressed as he was, euen to an huge depth thereof) had so vrgent occasion to seeke: yet notwithstanding should bee all this while, euen a whole age to speak of, so buried in obliuion (for any thing that we <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> read to the contrary) euen in his owne Country in the midst of the people of God. But then is it a notable example withal, and much tending to out instruction, not only that men, though much beholding vnto them, or in great need of them, do neuerthelesse oft-times little remember them: but euen that God also dooth not euer vse, but see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth strangely for long time to forget the best of them all: and that in a time of such confusion, as wherein it should seeme, that some way or other, they were most of all to be imployed.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Those other three of the line of <hi>Iehu</hi> who after succeeded, did two of them enioy the Crowne some reasonable time, &amp; came vnto it immediatly vpon the auoidance of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> such as were in it before: but long it was before the other came vnto it, &amp; besides he was soon cut off. The former of those two that enioyed it som reasonable time, &amp; cam so readily vnto it, was <hi>Iehoash,</hi> the son of <hi>Iehoahaz</hi> already remembred: in whose time seeing we haue the residue of <hi>Eliseus</hi> his Story, therefore haue we, when we haue seen <note place="margin">Iehoash</note> the Storie of the King, then to come to the Prophet also. As touching the King, first wee haue deliuered vnto vs, what was the whole course of his raigne generally: then certaine particulars besides. The whole course of his raigne was ill, neuer <note place="margin">2 Kings. 13: 10, 11.</note> departing from the sinnes of <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> but still walking therein, as all his praede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors before him had done: and so continued sixteene yeares. The particulars are of two sorts: one, a commendable regard he had to the Prophet; the other, certaine dealing of his with the enemie. In that commendable regard he had to the Prophet, we haue not onely deliuered what it was: but also, that it was well rewarded. His regard was such, that hee came vnto him when hee was sicke, and tooke it heauilie <note place="margin">Ibid. 14.</note> that then they were likely to leese him: accounting him, both his Father; and the stay or strength of that whole State. Well rewarded it was, in that the Prophet did then giue him so comfortable assurance, that hee shoulde mightily praeuaile a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <note place="margin">Ibid. 15-17.</note> the <hi>Syrians,</hi> euen to theyr vtter destruction; naming withall the place vnto him, where he should looke to haue the fruition of that speciall blessing of GOD: <note place="margin">Ibid. 18, 19.</note> and when thereuppon hee willed him to strike the Earth, or to lay vppon it with those Arrowes which hee had in his hand, and hee, hauing doone so thryce, stay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> there, and proceeded no farther, hee tolde him hee should haue layed oftner

The <hi>Iewes</hi> became his enemies also, by occasion that <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> made a spoile of the Temple &amp; kings treasury, tooke away certaine Hosta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and so returned. Of the Prophet we haue no story remaining, but onely that hee <note place="margin">Ibid. 10: 20.</note> died of that sicknesse wherein he lay when the King was with him, and so was accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly buried: but, though God did not exempt him from death as hee had done his Maister before; yet that soone after God did so specially grace him when hee was dead: namely, that within the compasse of the yeare following, when as certain of the people were about to bury the corps of another man that was dead, &amp; being nere to <note place="margin">Ibid. 20, 21.</note> the place where the Prophet was buried before, cast in thither their Corse also in hast, for that they espied certaine bands of their enemies cōming in vpon them: so soone as the dead corps touched the bones of the Prophet, it praesently reuiued, and so the man liued againe. And God in some measure in such sort graceth many of his seruants yet; by their writings or good example while they liued, quickning others to follow them in the ages ensuing: a matter so much the worthier to be considered, as hauing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in good encouragement to be doing the best seruice we can, when as we remember how auaileable it may proue to be, not only while our selues do liue, but many yeares after that we are dead. The latter of those two of the line of <hi>Iehu,</hi> who enioyed the Crown some reasonable time, was <hi>Ieroboam</hi> the son of <hi>Ioash,</hi> who raigned 41. years: <note place="margin">Ieroboam</note> who also was ill; and yet vouchsafed speciall fauour of God. Il he was, in that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted <note place="margin">2 King. 14: 23 Ibid. 24.</note> not from the sins of <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> but walked therein as his praedecessors before had done. In that speciall fauour that God did vouchsafe him we haue deliuered vnto vs, what that fauour was: and whereupon the Lord did vouchsafe it vnto him. That <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> speciall fauour was, that whereas God by <hi>Ionah</hi> the Prophet had fore-shewed such a thing before, he now accordingly gaue him power to recouer all the coasts of Israell <note place="margin">Ibid. 25.</note> out of the hands of those that had gotten them away before. The reason whereupon the Lord so did, was, for that he saw the exceeding great affliction of <hi>Israel;</hi> and that they were altogether without helpe therein; yet that God was not disposed, then to <note place="margin">Ibid. 26, 27.</note> take them cleane away; and therefore holp them by this <hi>Ieroboam.</hi> He that stayed so long before he came to it, and besides was soone cut off, was <hi>Zachariah</hi> the sonne of <hi>Ieroboam</hi> who next succeeded, and was the fourth in descent from <hi>Iehu,</hi> according as <note place="margin">Zacariah.</note> the Lord had promised vnto him. But first before he should come to the crown, it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth <note place="margin">2 Kin. 15: 8-12</note> that God would shew himselfe much offended with that race of <hi>Iehu,</hi> to whom he had promised it for the fourth descent; expecting belike, that they or some of them at least, should haue walked more carefully in his waies: and seeing hitherto none of them would do it, neither would he yet performe that promise of his to him that now followed &amp; was the last of them; but would hold him off in suspence for a time, to oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion him to see better vnto it, than his elders before had done. For it is plain, that he came not to the kingdome, till 22. yeares after the death of his Father: and there was none that we read of that did raigne in the meane season. That it was so long before he came to the kingdome, may thus be gathered. In the 27. yeare of <hi>Ieroboam</hi> his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <note place="margin">2 King. 15: 1, 2</note> came <hi>Azariah</hi> the Son of <hi>Amasiah,</hi> the King of <hi>Iudah,</hi> to his kingdom of <hi>Iudah,</hi> and raigned therein two and fifty years. <hi>Ieroboam</hi> his Father raigned but one and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: &amp; so continued but to the fifteenth of the raign of <hi>Azariah</hi> or <hi>Ʋzziah</hi> aforesaid. So if this <hi>Zachariah</hi> had come to the Crowne immediatly after his Fathers death, as his other ancestors before did, then he should haue come vnto it in the fifteenth year of <hi>Vzziah</hi> or <hi>Azariah</hi> aforesaid: but he came not vnto it, till the eight and thirtith yeare of his raigne; so leauing two and twenty yeares of the raigne of <hi>Azariah,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <note place="margin">Ibid. 8.</note> he was able to come to succeed his Father in the kingdome. In which time the people (no doubt too, were in very hard and miserable estate: beeing euer the lesse
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:7530:222"/> euill of the two, to haue the worst King, and the greatest tyrant that euer was to raign ouer any people, than to haue no king at all, vnlesse they haue some other Magistrate to supply for the time. For the worst King that can be, cannot be so grieuous but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to some: but if there were none, nor others to supply that want for the time, then <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> would there be confusion to all. And so it may be, that God would teach them also heereby, that if they did so little regard to liue according to the ordinances that hee had giuen vnto them, neither did he much regard, if they had any pollicy or gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at all. So when hee had taught both him and them his minde for those matters, then in the end hee brought in that other of the line of <hi>Iehu,</hi> to sit on the seate of the Kingdome. But he likewise did ill in the sight of the Lord, cleauing to the sins of <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roboam,</hi> as his Fathers before had done: and so raigned but sixe monthes, <hi>Shallum</hi> conspiring against him, slaying him in the sight of the people, and raigning in his stead. Which bad dealing beeing heere begun, held on for the most part with those that followed, so long as the kingdome it selfe did afterward stand: he that next suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded, being likewise soone cut off; the residue enioying it some farther time.</p>
            <p n="4">4 As touching the residue of the Kinges that after succeeded, and were none of the line of <hi>Iehu,</hi> the next that came to the Crowne was <hi>Shallum;</hi> who raigned onely <note place="margin">Shallum.</note>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> onely one month: being then slaine by <hi>Menahem,</hi> as himselfe had slaine <hi>Zachariah</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ibid. 13, 14.</note> before; so leesing that new vsurped Kingdome of his, in a manner so soone as he had gotten it, and ending his life as wretchedly with it. And so it is lesse maruel, that these and the residue that hereafter follow, are not on all hands accounted Kinges, but ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantes <note place="margin">

               </note> rather: disorderly, for the most part, comming vnto the Crowne, and hauing their gouernment sutable thereunto. Those that enioyed it some farther time, were two of them of one line: the others, but strangers one to the other. Those that were of one line, was this <hi>Menahem</hi> for one: and his son succeeding him for the other. Of <note place="margin">Menahem</note> this <hi>Menahem</hi> thus comming to the kingdome, first we haue some things noted that were common to him and others: then, some other thinges that were propper vnto himselfe. Common to him and others are, the time, and manner of his raigne. For the time it is noted, that he raigned ten yeares: and for the manner, that he also did <note place="margin">2. Kings. 15: 17, 18.</note> ill, walking in the waies of <hi>Ieroboam</hi> as others had done. Proper to himselfe are other two: one, an example of speciall cruelty; the other, a point of worldly pollicy. In that speciall cruelty of his, it is good to note, first what it was: then, what a token therein we may see, how mightily ambition sometime rageth. The cruelty was great, first in it selfe: but then much greater by one circumstance of the place that is noted. It was great in it selfe, for that he destroyed a whole Citty, and the people thereof, &amp; <note place="margin">Ibid. 16.</note> ript vp the women with child, because they did not receiue him in thither. That one circumstance of the place, is, that wheras <hi>Thapsa</hi> the citty that so he destroyed, seems <note place="margin">

How migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily sometimes ambition rageth, is here very plainely at first to be be seen: he hauing so ill a title as he had, and yet wreaking his greife so bitterly on such as did not at first reciue him. In such cases to be forth-putting, was very tollerable among the <hi>Romans,</hi> in that declyning estate of theirs: and thence doe many of vs take so good heart, and put on such face, as in such case wee often doo. But this may teach vs (as that parable of <hi>Iotham</hi> before) that where ambition is so praedominant, there also is <note place="margin">Iud. 9: 7-15.</note> much iniquitie, if not sauage barbarity, lurking. That point of worldly pollicy which in him wee may note, was, that <hi>Pul</hi> the King of <hi>Asshur,</hi> beeing stirred <note place="margin">2. Kings. 15: 19▪ 20. 1. Chr. 5: 26.</note> vppe by the Lorde for the chasticement of the people Israell, and so comming in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:7530:223"/> this <hi>Menahem,</hi> he thought good so to praesent him, and so farre to pacifie his displeasure towards him, as not onely might free him from the danger of his armes, but might bee a farther strength to that his vsurpation also: and so yeelded to giue him a thousand tallents of Siluer; but made the people themselues to pay it. The other of this line besides, was <hi>Pecaiah</hi> his Sonne, of whom we haue no Story to speak <note place="margin">Pecaiab.</note> off, but onely that he raigned two yeares, and did ill in the sight of God, as his elders <note place="margin">2. Kings. 15 23, 24.</note> before him had done: and then, as his Father had slaine <hi>Shallum</hi> before, and possessed himselfe of his Kingdome; so did <hi>Pekah</hi> one of his Captaines slay him now, &amp; tooke vnto him his Kingdome withall. But truely it was but a small recompence to the Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice of God, for so many as his father had so vnmercifully destroyed (and, it may be, without cause too, vnlesse his tittle had beene better to the place hee was in, than it seemeth it was) the recompence that should be made therefore, should goe no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> but onely to this one person, the Son of one that was very bloody, and himselfe none of the best. <hi>Achab</hi> was, as it were, but priuie (or secretly consenting) to the death of one (but that it seemeth, his children were wrapt in with him too:) and yet must satisfaction be made with all his whole line, which were many; yea, with all his kindred, and friends too. <hi>Menahem</hi> had mercilesly slaughtered many, euen an whole Countrey to speake off, man, woman, and child; not for any benefite to himsele, as did the other, but in the way of reuenge, as it seemeth, and that vpon a small trespasse made, if it were any: and yet wee reade but onely of one, that heere is seazed-on to make the reckoning. We must leaue all iudgement to God: but his iustice is euer one; and, according to the measure of sinne vnrepented, may iudgement be feared. But then is it a more blessed thing, and much more on our parts to bee desired, that our sinne be roundly punished heere to our bettering for the time ensuing: than that heere it should be but easily dealt-with, &amp; then put-ouer to future iudgement. Those that were but strangers, one to another, were those two that next followed: <hi>Pekah</hi> the former, and <hi>Hoshoah</hi> the latter, yea, and the last of all the company. <hi>Pekah</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise came to the Crown by the blood of his Maister. For being one of <hi>Pecaiahs</hi> Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, <note place="margin">Pekah.</note> with the priuity and helpe of two others besides (as it seemeth, of much like <note place="margin">2 King. 15: 25</note> place in the Court, as himselfe) and fifty others of his followers, he slew <hi>Pecaiah</hi> his Lord and Maister, euen in the head Citty of his Kingdome, and in the Pallace it selfe: and so inuaded the Kingdome withall, though but in this bad manner hee got it, yet <note place="margin">Ibid. 27. Ibid. 28.</note> he held it about twenty yeares. He also did ill in the sight of the Lord, by following the waies of <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> as all his praedecessors (in that Kingdome) before him had done, and is without any farther Story, vntill very neere the ende of his raigne: but then haue we two speciall Stories to his time, or to the Story of his raigne appertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. That we haue no farther Story of him, till towardes the end of his raigne, it appeareth, because that both those Stories that we haue of him, haue no place in any part of the raigne of <hi>Iotham</hi> King of <hi>Iudah;</hi> but in the daies of <hi>Ahaz</hi> his Sonne who next succeeded: and it is plaine, that <hi>Iotham</hi> came to the Crowne of <hi>Iudah,</hi> but in the second yeare of this King of <hi>Israell</hi> that now we speake off; and that he raigned sixe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen <note place="margin">Ibid. 37. Ibid. 33.</note> yeares. Which of necessity taking vp better than seauenteene years of his twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, leaue him not full out his last three for both those Stories that we haue to him ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaining, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> or at least but thereabout. Whereas therefore those two Stories (as in themselues we are more fully to see) were, one of them to imploy him in a peece of seruice, the other to learne himselfe and his people to know how far they offended: we may probably conceiue, it was long before the Holinesse of God could as it were disgest to vse so bad a man, and so badly comming to the roome he was in, in any ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of his; and that he gaue him time to repentance in great measure, before that he did lay his reuenging hand vpon him. The former of those Stories wherein i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Wherein we may see that euen as <hi>Ahaz</hi> did by his Idolatry in great measure offend, and thereby led the people to that course also; euen so did God proportionably poure foorth his displeasure vppon them: and that, the greater theyr deuotion was in that kinde, though they might conceiue of themselues, that they were (at least) very religious; yet that thereby they made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues so much the more offensiue to God, as Pope-holy persons now, and deuout Idolaters in all ages doe. The mercy that God therein vsed towardes them, was in those Prisoners, and part of the spoile: wherein we haue more specially noted, what aduise it was that by a Prophet was for that matter giuen vnto them; &amp; what regard was on their partes yeelded thereunto. In the aduise that by the Prophet was for that matter giuen vnto them, it is good to note, not only what the matter of it was: but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, in what manner it was deliuered vnto them. The matter of it was, first, as touching theyr waies: then, as touching his aduise therein. In their waies he noteth what they they had already done: and what they were then of purpose to do. That which he no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth they had don already, was, that because God had deliuered into their hands their <note place="margin">2 Chr. 28▪ 9.</note>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Brethren of <hi>Iury</hi> for their sins, they had now slaine them in most rageous maner, tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming their rage to be such, as in detestation or greatnesse of it, reached vp to heauen. That which he noteth them to be of purpose then to do, was, to haue those Bretheren <note place="margin">Ibid. 10.</note> of theirs their prisoners, as bond-men and bond-women vnto them. As touching his aduise therein, to the end they may the better receiue it, first, he maketh some way vnto it: then, commeth he forth with his aduise it selfe. The way that he maketh vnto it, is, that he asketh them, if their waies be not such, as that the Lord might find them faulty <note place="margin">Ibid. 10. Ibid. 11.</note> also. Comming forth with his aduise it selfe, he willeth them to be said by him, and to send home againe those prisoners of theirs: giuing thē withal to vnderstand (the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to moue them therin) that the fierce wrath of the Lord was towards them. As tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the manner, he was indeed a Prophet of the Lords, &amp; it may seeme so knowne <note place="margin">Ibid. 9</note> vnto them to be: but, if we mark, he did not now speak vnto them in the name of the Lord, or tell them now that God had sent him about that matter vnto them; but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as it were of himselfe, doth giue them his best aduise therein. The regard that was yeelded hereunto was great (notwithstanding the Prophet did not shew himselfe ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <note place="margin">Ibid. 12-15.</note> to come vnto them directly from God) first in that they yeelded to let them goe, (certaine Elders of <hi>Samaria</hi> first requiring that of the Army, and therewithall of the King himselfe it seemeth; then the Army, and with them the K. himselfe it seemeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, yeelding thereto:) then, in that they did it in so good manner, with the spoile refreshing and arraying them first, and then freely sending them home. A very good and rare example, both of obedience vnto the Prophet, yeelding so fully and so ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally to be ruled by him, so much to their losse, &amp; for which they had ventured their liues: and, of compassion towards their Brethren, notwithstanding they had bin, and yet were, their enimies also, &amp; now of long had bin dāgerous to their estate. Many of vs haue taken prisoners of our brethren, euen the greatest part of the maintenance of the Ministery among vs, and thereby themselues withall; neyther haue we beene de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute of Prophets that haue reprooued vs therein: but where haue we any that send backe those prisoners againe, and in so good manner as did the others; or when it is likely, it will be done generally, when as it sticketh so hard as it doth in all our par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars? How can it be, but that, that vsurping King of Israell, and all his Army, must one day rise vp in iudgement against many of our lawfull Kinges and other Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> together with their peoples professing the Gospell, and condemne them: euen onely for this, for that still they with-hold, or yet doe keepe so fast in their clouches those prisoners of theirs; or may they thinke their deuotion is sound, that can still dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest to doe it? The latter of those Stories beeing to teach the King and his people how far they offended, we are not only to marke what it is was done vnto them: but withall, when, or at what time the same was done. That which was done vnto them, was, that <hi>Tiglath-Pileser</hi> (called also <hi>Tilgath-Pilneeser;</hi> and <hi>Pul,</hi> another King there ioyned vnto him, came in forcibly vpon them, wan many of their Citties, and took <note place="margin">2 King. 15: 29 1 Chr. 5: 26</note>
               <pb n="424" facs="tcp:7530:224"/> away a great part of the people, and scattered them in Countries of his owne among the Heathen. The time when this was done, necessarily falling out to bee shortly after, that the <hi>Israelites</hi> had so farre obeyed the Prophet, and shewed that compassion towardes their Bretheren, it teacheth vs, that as God spared not those <hi>Israelites</hi> for those two rare and speciall duties which now they yeelded, abiding yet as they did in the sinnes of <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> the Idolatry of those golden Calues: so may God bee as highly offended with vs, notwithstanding our profession of the Gospell now, so long as we are so defectiue as we are in those two duties or eyther of them, in which wee had so good example giuen by them, and yet is so vntowardly learned of vs. And true repentance doth not onely amend some one thing or other that was amisse; but euer hath an eye vnto all: and resteth not, till, in some good measure, it hath taken good order for all. The time of his raigne thus beeing finished, and ending so miserably as he did, it may probably be conceiued, that heereupon, he who next suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded, tooke occasion to step vp in his roome. And so it doth immediatly follow, that then <hi>Hoshea</hi> wrought Treason against him, smote him, and slewe him, and raig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <note place="margin">Hoshea</note> in his stead. But this man being the last of the Kinges of <hi>Israell,</hi> in whose time <note place="margin">2 King. 15: 30</note> the Kingdome it selfe was vtterly abolished, so that after this time there remained neyther Kingdome nor people of Israell: wee are now to consider, not onely of so much of the Story as concerneth himselfe; but of that also, which concerneth his kingdome, which together with himselfe did perish. That which concerneth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, is some part of it plainely set downe: and some part againe, more obscurely. That which is plainely set downe, is, that hee did ill in the sight of the Lord; but not <note place="margin">2 King. 17. 2-6</note> as the Kinges of Israell that were before him: and that for some part of his raigne he was in subiection to the King of <hi>Assyria;</hi> but afterward with-drew himselfe so farre againe (leaning then to the King of <hi>Aegypt)</hi> that thereby the King of <hi>Assyria</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> tooke oceasion to inuade the Land, to the ouer-throw of himselfe, and of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. Wherein it is good more specially to note, one thing, first, as touching the getting of this his Kingdome: and then one other, as touching that commendation, of him, that he did not so ill as the other Kinges before him. As touching the get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of this his Kingdome at the first, he got it we saw, by the slaughter of him that was in it before; a very inordinate meane to obtaine, not onely a place of so speciall note, but any of the meanest places that are: and so lesse maruell, that it sped no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with him, but to be the bane of himselfe, and of all that did belong vnto him. In that hee was not so ill as others, and yet that in his time the whole Kingdome should be s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> ruined, we may very well gather, that though we be not so very ill as many are: yet may the heauiest iudgementes that God vseth heere in this World to cast on Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, bee in his Iustice due vnto vs, and seaze on vs too in greater measure than wee could haue doubted; and that, without any impeachment at all to the Iustice of God. That which is more obscurely set downe, is, as touching the time of his raign: that whereas it is said in one place, that hee began his raigne in the twentith yeare of <note place="margin">Ibid. 15: 30.</note>
               <hi>Iotham,</hi> that is the twentith yeare after that <hi>Iotham</hi> began his raigne (for hee raig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned but sixteene, and as yet there was no mention made of <hi>Ahaz</hi> that followed next, that the reckoning might bee from him deryued) in another, that hee beganne his raigne in the twelfth yeare of <hi>Ahaz,</hi> eyght yeares after the other: albeit there bee <note place="margin">Ibid. 17: 1</note> diuers interpretations thereof, yet seeing wee see the Text it selfe dooth lead vs to conceiue, that hee submitted himselfe to <hi>Salmaneser</hi> the King of <hi>Assyria,</hi> it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth <note place="margin">Ibid. 3.</note> to bee the likelyest, that the former place speaketh of his owne stepping vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Kingdome, before hee became the Vassall of <hi>Salmaneser;</hi> and the latter of his confirmation by him therein, now also by likely-hood holding his kingdome of him: and then, that the ninth or last yeare of his raigne afterward spoken of, was not to bee taken from his first entery into his Kingdome, on the death of <hi>Pekah:</hi> but from the time when hee was by <hi>Salmaneser</hi> confirmed in it; and that, as the Text saith, that <hi>Salmaneser</hi> found Treason in him, so thereuppon wee may gather, that before hee had become, (as wee doe tearme it) a Vassall vnto him. So was he, for one part of his raign, as it were, a King, and yet none; and, in another, a kind of King indeede, but in subiection, and besides, where least he would: and yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding,
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:7530:224"/> a Kingdome, both for freedome and glory good enough for those that make their way by such intrusion; and the end of it too, albeit more miserable than any would wish it, yet sutable enough to the beginning. That which concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> his kingdome, is first of those that then were: then, of others that did succeed them. As touching those that then were, we haue deliuered vnto vs, not onely the punnishment that God cast on them; but one speciall note of the time besides. In their punishment we haue likewise deliuered vnto vs, what was done with them: and wherefore. That which was doone with them, was, that so many of them as in the <note place="margin">Ibid. 6▪ 24 18: 11.</note> warre escaped the Sword, were taken away Captiue, and scattered in other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries: and other peoples brought in in their roomes to inhabit there. The reason wherefore they were so dealt with, was for, that by the meanes of <hi>Ieroboam</hi> they <note place="margin">Ibid. 7-23. 18: 12.</note> did so fall from the Lorde then: and afterward would neuer bee reclaimed to him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. That one speciall note of the time besides, is, that this their vtter and final ruine falling vpon them in the dayes of <hi>Hezechiah</hi> King of <hi>Iudah,</hi> as he had taken speciall paines with them, to reclaime to the Lorde againe: so they also, for many of them <note place="margin">2 Chr. 30: 5-10 Ibid. 11-13.</note> came in, in very good manner, ioyning with <hi>Iudah</hi> in the true seruice of God. Out of which we may gather, that the Iustice of God on our impenetency long before, may in time grow so resolute against vs, that albeit we doe in some thinges seeke vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him againe; yet will it be too late then to reuerse againe, that which he before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined: and yet, that the Idolatrous may deceiue themselues, if, because the ruine of the Kingdome of <hi>Israell</hi> did then come vpon them, when many of them had sought the Lord a little before, they should thereon conceiue, that leauing those Calues and seeking the Lord, was the cause of that their ruine. As touching those that did suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede, although they are no part of this people, but meere strangers vnto them, and at this time might rather be held to bee of the number of their enemies also: yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause hereafter they goe oft-times vnder the name of <hi>Israelites,</hi> and not vnlikely, but that diuers of the <hi>Israelites</hi> (such as shog'd aside for the time, to auoide the danger of the enemies Sword, and afterward came dropping in againe) did afterward come in and dwell among them, at least because these doe now hence-forward inhabit that Land where the <hi>Israelites</hi> dwelt before, therefore it shall bee good to see the Story of them. And their Story is no more but to shew, how far forth by their comming thither they also were wonne to be professors of the God of Israell, whereas before they were altogether ignorant of him, and heere also worshipped the Idols of theyr owne Countries, whereunto before they were invred: and first, whereuppon it was, that they came to yeeld so farre to be worshippers of the God of Israell, then, how farre they yeelded vnto it. That any thing at all they yeelded thereunto, is more than in such case may be expected, not onely for that it is not the manner of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> sort of men, easily to make any change of their wonted Religion; but also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause these were so much the more vnlikely in this case to doe it, for that this ancient people of his were now brought so low as they were: and howsoeuer it was, the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is plaine, that for a time, at their first comming thither, they did not acknowledge <note place="margin">2 King. 17▪ 25</note> the God of Israell. But then the Lord sending in Lyons among them, and destroying many of them, it was conceiued after their manner, but more truly than they were <note place="margin">Ibid. 25-28.</note> aware of, that it was because they did not worship the God of that Countrey: they conceiuing no farther, but that, as they supposed, there were seuerall Gods of euery Countrey, so was it in this case also; but yet making him no better therein, than the rest of his fellowes, fellowes I meane, as they supposed. And according as themselues did in such sort take it, so did they cast to prouide some remedy: namely, to get some to instruct them, how to worship the God of that Land. But as the motion was made but for one; so we read but of one sent: a sufficient token, that on all hands they made no great reckoning of it (nothing so much as they ought to haue done) when as there was no farther care but of one for so many people, inhabiting so many citties, and so great a circuit as it. A meet pattern of the care that is in many of vs for those matters: but ours though some-what exceeding theirs, yet much more repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uable▪ not only for the greater light that God hath giuen vs; but also, for that we, for our own priuate luker, withdraw that, which others had laid forth to <hi>y<seg rend="sup">t</seg>
               </hi> purpose. How
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:7530:225"/> far they yeelded vnto it, we haue very plainly set down vnto vs: first more at large; then, more briefly comprised together. While it is done more largely, first we haue declared vnto vs, what was done by the people themselues at the first: then, what was done by their Issue or posterity ensuing. That which was done by themselues at the first, rested in two points: one, that stil they held to their wonted Idols (which also are, for many of them, named there;) the other, that neuethelesse they serued <note place="margin">Ibid. 29-33.</note> (in some sort, or after their manner) the Lord too. Whereunto when once they had yeelded, although this were nothing to that which they should, yet now it seemeth, that those Lions came no more at them, but were thereon restrained, because wee heere no more of them after. A reasonable good Testimony, that the Lord is oft-times content to take what wee doe but meanly yeeld: and a good warning withall, that we hauing done somewhat, do not thinke we haue then yeelded full contentment vnto him, if he thereupon withdraw his hand from vs; when as wee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> see, that heere he did the like, and yet that the people had nothing neere yeelded that which they should. That which was done by their Issue or posterity, vnto that time when these things were recorded of them, was in effect the same and none other, that was done by those their elders before. But heere haue wee more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly <note place="margin">Ibid. 34.</note> set downe, as I do take it, two things: the former of them, not so cleared in the iudgement of others; but the latter of them, out of quaestion withall. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer of them it is, as I doe take it, that so diuiding betwixt both, the Text dooth charge them, that they did neither, but, as the Prophet <hi>Elias</hi> tearmed the like, hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted betwixt them. For the words are, that they neither feared God, nor did after their Ordinances, nor after their Customes, nor after the Law, not after the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement which the Lord commanded the children of <hi>Iacob,</hi> &amp;c. So it seemeth the meaning is, that they did neyther: first setting down that they feared not God; then, that they did not after their owne Ordinances nor Customes neither. But then, because it was hardest for them to conceiue, that they did not feare GOD, when now they had betaken themselues to bee worshippers of him, and when that plague of the Lyons was ceased (as it seemeth that now it was, because wee heere no more of them since) therefore is that point more fully explained vnto them: first in the residue of this verse that now wee are in; then, in all the rest that followeth. In the residue of this verse that now we are in, it is added, that they did not worship or feare him after the Lawe, nor after the Commaundement which the Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded <note place="margin">Ibid. 34.</note> the children of <hi>Iacob.</hi> But now the truth is, that whereas I haue enterpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the former part of this verse, where there is mention made of ordinances and Customes, that they were their owne Ordinances and Customes that there were meant: others there bee, who attribute the same also to God. But seeing it is <note place="margin">Ari. Montan. Tremel. Iun. Bibl. Angl. Vet. edit. Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tab. I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

But heere it is not to bee denied, but that some of those that do retaine the plurall number, neuerthelesse do not refer the <note place="margin">Tremel. Iun. Bibl. Angl.</note> same to those new Inhabitants placed heere now, but to those of the ten-Tribes dwelling there before: but I see so little warrant for their so doing, that I rather thinke it to be as before I haue noted; and the rather, for that in the former of those <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="L"/> words which so I interpreted, there is another of good iudgement concurring. The same is more fully explained in that which followeth, for that therein is more speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Conr.

The later of those two thinges, which heere I saide we had more distinctly see downe, and which was out of quaestion with all men, is, that it is no fearing or worshipping of God, when other thinges are ioyned with those that hee by his word hath appointed: but that whosoeuer would haue the Testimony of a good conscience, that he worshippeth God, he must sequester him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe from all such worshipping of him, as is not taught by his holy word, and keepe himselfe praecisely onely to it. When the matter is more briefly comprised toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:7530:225"/> neuerthelesse it is plainely said, both of those that then were there placed first, <note place="margin">Ibid. 41.</note> and of all their posterity following, that euer they kept so long as they stood, their mingle-mangle in Religion: after a sort fearing God; and yet seruing their Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges also.

            <p n="1">1 <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S touching the kingdome of <hi>Iudah</hi> that stood the longest, whereas <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> the estate of it was also variable (first for a time being in their won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted freedome, and a kingdome themselues; but afterward beeing in subiection to others) it shall be good for vs, in such sort to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider of them: first so long as themselues were a kingdome; then, when they were in subiection to others. As they were a kingdom themselues, it shall be good, first to consider of it also, but generally, as we did of the kingdome of <hi>Israel</hi> before: then to come to a more speciall consideration of it. The generall consideration of it, or such as doth appertaine to the whole, resteth in two principall points: one, what time it stoode; the other, in what manner it was, or what was their estate therein. The time that they stood, or were in their won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted freedome, and a kingdome by themselues, was, from the diuision aforesayd, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <note place="margin">386. <hi>Functius.</hi>
               </note> three hundred fourescore and sixe yeares (some diuersity of reckoning beeing conceiued by diuers, for a few yeares;) or, as some account (foure yeares more) <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> three hundered and ninety: and so, longer than the kingdome of <hi>Israel,</hi> by one <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Beroaldus Broughton.</hi> 133.</note> hundred thirty and three yeares. The estate wherein these stood, wee may easily conceiue, euen at the first, was much more tollerable, than that wherein the <hi>Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi> were, of which we haue heard: first because of the promises made to the Tribe of <hi>Iudah,</hi> and line of <hi>Dauid;</hi> then, for that all this while they had no mo Kings that raigned ouer them, than had the other, and (one onely Vsurper for a while excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) all but of one line neither. More specially seeing we find, that this kingdom stood much longer than the other, it shall not be amisse, that we consider of it in what estate it stood, first, so long as the other continued with it: then, when the other was taken from it. In that compasse of time wherein the other continued with it, we finde, that once it pleased God to touch the line of <hi>Dauid,</hi> and the scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Iudah</hi> withall, by the vsurpation of an vngodly and bloudy woman, who nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was of the house of <hi>Dauid,</hi> nor of any of the Tribes of al the people, but a meer stranger vnto them: but then soone after to make a riddance of her, and to bring in the Scepter of <hi>Iudah,</hi> and the Line of <hi>Dauid</hi> againe. So it shall not be amisse, first to consider of the estate of this kingdome, vntill the time that God gaue such a snub to the Scepter of <hi>Iudah,</hi> and line of <hi>Dauid:</hi> and then of the time when they were both restored againe. Before that snub was giuen vnto them, we find like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, that for a time the Kings of <hi>Iudah</hi> stoode cleare from all enter-course or doo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings with the Kings of <hi>Israel:</hi> but afterward they grew into friendship with them. They stoode cleare of them for three of their first Kings: of which the two former were offensiue to God by their Idolatry; the other tooke a better course for that matter. The two former were <hi>Roboam,</hi> or <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> and <hi>Abiam</hi> his sonne. <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam</hi> the Sonne of <hi>Salomon,</hi> vnder whome the kingdome, as we heard before, was <note place="margin">Roboam.</note> deuided, raigned seauenteene yeares: three of them reasonably well; but the resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due, <note place="margin">1.

His employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

About that part of his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome which reuolted from him, his employment was, to recouer it againe if hee might. But it is good, more carefully to keepe such blessinges as it pleaseth God to giue vs, and better to see to them while we haue them: hard it is, when once (by our owne default) they are gone, to get them againe, in such sort as wee had them before. <hi>Esau</hi> might be a sufficient example to all ages ensuing: but vnthrifts and fooles will euer be doing notwithstanding. He sought to recouer it againe, first, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> as it seemeth, by making as though hee did not yet take it, that they were so muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mously disposed, as in their griefe they seemed to be: and so did but send his Officer <note place="margin">1 King. 12: 18 2 Chr. 10: 18 <hi>Conr.

But they then shewed, that they were in good-earnest and did not dally, being yet in such heat vpon the answere the King had giuen them, that they killed his Officer, and put the King himselfe in such feare, that hee sped himselfe away so fast as he could vnto <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> When this way would not serue, then he thought to do it by force: but therein also he was disappointed; and yet in that disappointing of his, he yeelded an example of good obedience. To the end that by force hee might doe it, being come to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> hee gathered together an <note place="margin">Ibid. 21. 2. Chr. 11: 1.</note> hundred and fourescore thousand able men, of the Tribes of <hi>Iudah</hi> and <hi>Beniamin (Beniamin</hi> now, one Tribe mo than before, ioyning it selfe to the line of <hi>Dauid)</hi> so to go against <hi>Ieroboam</hi> to recouer his Kingdome againe: but he was forbidden (he and all his people) to proceede therein, the Lord sending <hi>Shemaiah</hi> the Prophet in <note place="margin">Ibid. 22-24. 2 Chr. 11: 2-4</note> his name to forbid them, and to let them vnderstand, that it was of him, that so the Kingdome was now diuided. The obedience that hee and the residue yeelded thereunto, was, that they all accordingly ceased to proceede any farther therein, and so departed: giuing therein so much the better example of obedience vnto the Prophet, in that the matter was altogether ciuill; and for no lesse, than for a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. About that part of his Kingdome that still aboad with him, his imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were, all (to speake of) about fortifications: but yet one other thing there is besides, wherein he bestowed himselfe but ill; although notwithstanding it may be his meaning was, thereby also to make his state so much the stronger. For his fortifications hee is noted to haue builded and repaired many Citties in <hi>Iudah</hi> and <hi>Beniamin:</hi> and to haue furnished them, both with Victuals and Armour. That o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">2 Chr. 11: 5-12</note> thing wherein hee bestowed himselfe but ill, and yet might haue a meaning therein to make his state so much the stronger, was, that he gaue himselfe so much <note place="margin">Ibid. 18-23.</note> to the vse of women: hauing eighteene Wiues, and threescore Concubines; and begetting on them eight and twenty Sonnes, and threescore Daughters, whom he dispersed into the chiefe Citties, but making most reckoning of <hi>Abiah,</hi> called also <hi>Abiam</hi> who next succeeded him in the Kingdome. But whereas afterward wee heare that fouly hee fell, in this we may see, that it was no otherwise likely, being so loose a man in his Wedlocke, and so impotently giuen to the lusts of the flesh as hee was. It pleased God notwithstanding so to blesse him, that his Kingdome was soone after much encreased: and in such manner, as that out of the same we may <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> probably con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="4 letters">
                  <desc>••••</desc>
               </gap>e another speciall matter besides.

That other speciall matter besides, that out of it may be conceiued, is, that these the better sort of the people of <hi>Israell</hi> so gathering themselues to the Kingdome of <hi>Iudah</hi> (the Priests and <hi>Leuites</hi> generally all, and many of the others besides) it may probably seeme, as in such cases men are wont to iudge, that they did so withdraw themselues, not onely in dislike of that departing that then was made from the Law
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:7530:226"/> of God, and from the promises made to the Tribe of <hi>Iudah</hi> and line of <hi>Dauid:</hi> but also on some speciall feare, that ere long there would bee some notable iudgement cast vppon them, euen to the vtter destruction of them; and yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing that State did stande better then two hundered yeares after. So that in such case wee are not onely to consider, what such hadde dealing of man deserueth: but how much it standeth with Gods glory, to shew his patience and long suffering, when himselfe is most deepely prouoked. When he gouerned ill, we haue likewise described vnto vs, what that ill gouernment of his was: and how they were punnished for it. That ill gouernment of his was, that he aboad vnto <note place="margin">1. Kings. 14: 21-12. 2. Chro 11: 17, 12: 1.</note> the Lord but three yeares onely, and then turned to Idolatry, he and all his people with him: and himselfe hauing let loose the bridle to the lusts of the flesh so much as he did, now was hee accordingly rewarded with most beastly lusts by others of his people committed, euen cleane contrary to nature it selfe. The punnishment that was inflicted on them for the same, is most of it restrained to one speciall time: but some part of it seemeth to be extended through all the most part of his gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. That part of it that was restrained to one speciall time, seemeth to yeelde a close example of so speciall dealing of God, as deserueth well, of vs to bee noted; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> and so are we to consider, what part of punishment it was that to one speciall time was so restrained; &amp; what was the speciall dealing of God, that deserueth so much of vs to be noted. That part of his punishment which to one speciall time was so restrained, came so strongly and so fearefully vppon them, that there-vppon they sought vnto the Lord: and yet notwithstanding they could not obtaine a full deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerance from it.

Whereuppon <note place="margin">2. Chro. 12: 5</note> the Princes of <hi>Iudah</hi> came to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> belike there, together with the King, to humble themselues vnto the Lord, in this their distresse to obtaine his fauor: when as notwithstanding the Lord at the first did send them word by the Prophet <hi>She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maiah,</hi> that they had forsaken the Lorde, and therefore the Lorde had thus giuen them to the hands of <hi>Sisak.</hi> But then, when they did acknowledge, that they had <note place="margin">Ibid. 6-<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> iustly deserued what the Lord had done vnto them, the Lorde then told the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet that he would shortly helpe them: but that in the meane season they shoulde be in subiection to <hi>Sisak,</hi> to let them see, what oddes there was betwixt his seruice, and to serue the Princes of the world. So their enemies came-on against them, &amp; preuailing, tooke away with them all the Treasure of the House of the Lorde and of the Kings pallace, together with those three hundred shields of beaten Golde, <note place="margin">Ibid. 9: 16.</note> which <hi>Salomon</hi> had made, three hundred siccles of golde going to euerie of them, and the Siccle of the Sanctuary being about our Ounce. But whereas there were <note place="margin">Ibid. 15.</note> two hundred Targets besides (of double waight to these) of those we read nothing heere: but it is not vnlikely, but that these went with their fellowes, beeing so rich a prey as they were, and the others now set on the spoile. That special dealing of God which now we speake of, doth part of it respect the <hi>Aegyptians:</hi> and part, the <hi>Israelites.</hi> That which respecteth the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> is, that whereas the Children of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
               <hi>Israel,</hi> had by the appointment and by the working of God himselfe, the spoyle of <hi>Aegypt</hi> at their departure thence, better than hue hundred yeares before this; now it pleaseth God, as it seemeth, to make them some amends for it againe, giuing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them the first spoile of one good part of the <hi>Israelites,</hi> after that once they were come to any speciall wealth, which was not at any time so much as in the dayes of <hi>Salomon</hi> now immediately past a little before. For in the wildernesse, where they were forty yeares next after they came out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> they had no meanes to get any wealth then. When they came into the land, though they had the spoyle of it, yet wee reade not of any speciall wealth they got thereby: and such as they got, being so often ouer-runne as they were in the time of the Iudges, by the
<pb facs="tcp:7530:227"/> old inhabitants of the Land and the people about them, wee may easily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue that among them they lost it all, and almost whatsoeuer they had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides: But now by the many and great victoryes of DAVID, and the most glorious raigne of <hi>Salomon</hi> for the first part of it, they were come to speciall great wealth, insomuch that Siluer was little set-by in the daies of <hi>Salomon▪</hi> and now hath the King of <hi>Egypt</hi> the first spoyle of all this their great aboundance. So graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous is God euen vnto the Heathen also, that if at some time hee haue dealt, as occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was offered, somewhat strictly with them, yet lightly doth hee take some time or other to requite it againe. That which respecteth the <hi>Israelites,</hi> is, that when God had now giuen them a speciall tast of the great glory of the estate or Kingdome of their promised Sauiour, that all might thirst after the same, and make no reckoning of the greatest excellencies in all the world in comparison of it; then did he immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately after (as it were of purpose) dash all in peeces, to the end that none should any thing at all rest in that earthly felicity or glory, but altogether turne vp their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections vnto the other, and euer be in expectation of it: a reasonable plaine token, not onely that he would not haue that greater glory to be darkened to them with the lesse; but withall, that he (in his wisedome) dooth not thinke the felicity of earthly thinges to bee meete for his children long to enioy heere, but that hee rather vseth them, to giue them some little tast sometimes (when himselfe thinketh good) of those better thinges that he doth meane them. That part of his punnishment that seemeth to be extended throughout the most part of his raigne, is, that all his time, to speake of, there was such warring betwixt him and <hi>Ieroboam:</hi> which seemeth to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/>

Whereby it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth that <hi>Ieroboam</hi> was most in fault, who hauing the greatest part of the Kingdome giuen him, did neuerthelesse still encroach vpon the other: and so gaue occasion of the warre; and was so much the meeter to punnish <hi>Rehoboams</hi> Idolatry, when as hee that had already bereft him of the most part of his Kingdome by farre, neuerthelesse could not yet let him be quiet with that which remained. For seeing <hi>Rehoboam</hi> did so readily yeeld to leaue of warre for the whole, it is not so likely that hee would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into it for any particular which he did not account to be his. And we see by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience among our selues, that such as get into the possession of others, though by such meanes as they haue vsed, they haue gotten the most part already: yet, so long as any part thereof remaineth, they giue the former owner but little sparing till they get all.</p>

But whereas it appeareth that <hi>Rehoboam</hi> had two Wiues before he had the <note place="margin">Ibi. 11: 18-20</note> Mother of <hi>Abiam,</hi> and that he had Sonnes▪ by them also, and yet made more of him than of the others, and in his life time purposed to make him King: it appeareth thereby, both that <hi>Rehoboam</hi> made no great reckoning either of his Sonnes Religion towards God that was to succeede him in the Kingdome, or of doing that right to the Sonne of the former wife, that the Law of God requireth; and that <hi>Abiam</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe <note place="margin">Deut. 21: 15-17.</note> made no conscience to step to the Kingdome before those his elder bretheren. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> A kinde of dealing that among vs also is sometimes found in those meaner matters that we are to deale with: the Father then making no conscience, to make his choice where he list himselfe to his owne best liking; and the brother regarding as little, to take the aduantage when it is offered, against the Brother. The ouerthrow that he
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:7530:227"/> gaue the kingdome of <hi>Israell</hi> was in the field, both parties there being gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether <note place="margin">2 Chr. 13: 3.</note> to try their right by the sword: at which time whereas there was some dealing betwixt them before the battailes ioyned, we are first giuen to vnderstand what dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling it was that first passed betwixt them; then, what was the issue of the incounter when once the battailes ioyned together. The dealing that first passed betwixt them, was diuers: one kind of dealing by <hi>Abiam;</hi> and another, by <hi>Ieroboam. Abiam</hi> labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, by debating the matter to reduce both him and the people to better aduisement: first making a way to a disswasion he vsed vnto them; then, comming to the disswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion it selfe. Making a way thereunto, first he frameth his speech but onely of the <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites:</hi> but then he speaketh both of those and the Iewes together. Framing his speech but only of the <hi>Israelites,</hi> first he sheweth them what was meet for thē to haue knowne: then, how contrary a course it is whereunto they haue since betaken them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues. He telleth them they ought to haue knowne, that God had giuen that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome <note place="margin">Ibid. 4, 5.</note> to <hi>Dauid,</hi> and to his line for euer. The course whereunto they had betaken themselues since, he sheweth to bee contrary thereunto, first in that they did before: <note place="margin">Ibid. 6. 7.</note> then in that which they conceiued now. That which they did before, was, first but seuerally of <hi>Ieroboam</hi> onely, that he being but onely the Seruant of <hi>Salomon</hi> before, had now risen vp in rebellion against his son for the kingdome; and of his company or followers, that lose and bad men had gathered vnto him: then of them both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, that by occasion of <hi>Rehoboams</hi> simplicity, they grew so strong that hee could not resist them. In that which they conceiued now, he noteth not onely what it was that now they conceiued: but withall (howbeit, in scorne, as it seemeth, at least, for one part of it) whereupon they so conceiued. That which they conceiued, he noteth <note place="margin">Ibid. 8.</note> to bee, that they thought themselues able to maintaine their cause against the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>Dauid:</hi> and that they did it in confidence of their strength, for that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> they were the greater party; and for that they had on their side the golden Calues which <hi>Ieroboam</hi> had made them for Gods. Speaking of these and themselues toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <note place="margin">Ibid. 9.</note> the <hi>Israelites</hi> first he chargeth, that they had chaced away the lawfull and true Priesthood, and had taken in a very base one in stead thereof; such notwithstanding as was good enough for those that were no Gods: but then comming to themselues, <note place="margin">Ibid. 10. 12.</note> he pleadeth first for the time past to that praesent, that they had kept vnto the Lord, &amp; that by his Priesthood his seruice was done among them; then, for that praesent, that the same God now tooke their partes against them, and that those his Priestes whom they had abandoned, were there in a readinesse to sound their Trumpets against them too. The disswasion it selfe that hee vsed vnto them, was, that they would not fight <note place="margin">Ibid. 12.</note> against the Lord God of their Fathers: and his reason was, that, if so they did, they should not prosper. <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> while <hi>Abiam</hi> was thus occupyed with them, was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uising <note place="margin">Ibid. 13.</note> how to intrap him and his people: and to that end sent an Ambush of men to get beyond them, so to get them in betwixt them to their owne best aduantage. So the Hoast of <hi>Iudah</hi> espying, that they had their enemies both before and behind, cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <note place="margin">Ibid. 14-20</note> vnto the Lord: which being done, the Priests blew the Trumpets, and the hoast of <hi>Iudah</hi> gaue a shout as hastening now to encounter their enemies; at which time the Lord so smote <hi>Ieroboam</hi> and the hoast of <hi>Israell,</hi> that praesently they fled before the hoast of <hi>Iudah,</hi> and lost in the field the greatest part of that their great army, euen fiue hundred thousand of them, together with diuers of their Citties, and neuer after were able to recouer themselues againe in the daies of <hi>Abiah.</hi>

As touching his life, he was a man, in whom the grace of God did notably appeare; and yet not without his infirmities neither. He raigned one and forty yeares: but it <note place="margin">2 Kin. 15. 9, 10</note> was the first part of his raigne wherein that grace of God did most appeare in him; &amp; his infirmity in the latter. In that first part of his raigne he yeelded himselfe to bee led by the grace of God two seuerall times: first by himselfe, without any other externall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> motion that we do read of; then again after, being stirred vp by one of the Prophets.
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:7530:228"/> When he did it by himself, he lost not by it, but was bountifully rewarded: and so are we first to consider of that his seruice of God; then, how he was rewarded for it. His seruice we haue setdown vnto vs first but generally: but then more specially. Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally it is said, that he did right in the eies of the Lord his God: euen as <hi>Dauid</hi> his Father. More specially hee is noted, both to haue purged the Land of much cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption <note place="margin">Kings. 15: 11, 14. 2 Chro. 14 2. 15: 17</note> that was therein: and to haue doone good thinges besides. The corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that was therein, was some part of it such, as did but indifferently touch them all; but some other part of it such, as touched euen himselfe some-what neere. That part of it which touched but all indifferently, is partly a foule vncleanenesse of theyr bodies that was growne vp among them: but most of it their Idolatrous waies. That soule vncleannesse of theit bodies that was growne vp among them, was that sinne <note place="margin">1 King. 15: 12</note> against Nature, which he abolished throughout his whole land. Their Idolatrous waies, it seemeth were many, according to the Idols of the Nations about them, or (if any of them yet remained) that dwelt among them: but of whatsoeuer kind they were, <note place="margin">2 Chr. 14: 3, 5</note> he both destroyed those Idols themselues; &amp; the high places and Groues where they worshipped. But whereas, as touching the latter member of these, it is in one place said, that he did not put downe the high places, and in another, that he took away all <note place="margin">1 King. 15: 14</note> the high places out of the Citties of <hi>Iudah:</hi> these two places laid together doe shew <note place="margin">2. Chr. 14: 5. Ibid. 15: 17</note> vs, that though he tooke away many of them, especially in <hi>Iudah:</hi> yet did many of thē remaine, especially in those parts of Israell where-withall neuerthelesse he had some dealing. That part of it which touched himselfe somewhat neere, was of idolatry also: certaine Idols that his Father had made before; &amp; certaine Idols of his Grandmother (there called his mother) which she maintained and worshipped yet. Those Idols that <note place="margin">1 King. 15: 13</note> his Father had made before, he now destroied: and not only destroied those Idols of his said Grand-mother, but for one of them which she had set vp in a groue (belike, <note place="margin">Ibid. &amp; 2. Chr. 15: 16</note> one of the chief or principal of them) he deposed her from her estate or regency, brake that Idoll it selfe in pieces, and made an vtter destruction of it in the best manner hee could. The good things that he did besides, were either about religion: or about the state it self. That which he did about religion, was for the better aduancement of it. Of that kind we haue two things noted vnto vs: one of them no more, but only his dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction vnto the people; the other hauing some farther matter to it appertaining. That <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> which was but his direction vnto the people, was, that he commanded them to seeke <note place="margin">2 Chr. 14: 4</note> the Lord God of their Fathers: and to do according to his praescript vnto them. That which hath some other matters to it appertaining, is, that he brought in the holy ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels <note place="margin">1 King. 15: 15</note> of his Father, &amp; the thinges that he had dedicated to the house of the Lord, trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure and plate. Those other matters hereunto appertaining are two: one, that hee did not take out or withdraw such things from the house of the Lord as his Father or him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe had giuen before; as many of vs in these daies do: the other, that whereas his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was no good worshipper of God before, as we saw when wee treated of him; it may probably be conceiued, that towards his death, either by the great successe that he had against the <hi>Israelites</hi> a little before, or by the meanes or good perswasion of this his son who was so well giuen himselfe, he was brought to some better bent than wherein he liued before. And then haue we an example heere (if it were by the latter of these two before conceiued) of some good wrought by a gracious son, towards the conuersion of his Idolatrous Father: a matter that would be in many of our cases, by vs also assaied.

His reward for this his seruice was such, as that part of it arose vnto him in the time of this his seruice: and part of it immediatly after. In the time of this his seruice it arose vnto him, first generally, that his estate was prosperous: then more specially, that on <note place="margin">Ibid. 7.

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> it may be that these, being nere to the <hi>Egiptians,</hi> and confining vpon them, but being a little farther off from <hi>Iury,</hi> towards the hart of their Countrey <hi>Affrike</hi> (who for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <note place="margin">Ibid. 12: 3.</note> of them, at that time also came in with the <hi>Egiptians)</hi> did now the rather come in vpon them againe, because they sped so well before.

Such folly notwithstanding doe the Children of the World, enemies to the Gospell, euer now and then renue. yet in these daies also: because somtimes they haue had a faire hand against the better pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessors, for some prouocation that hath beene found in them against the Lord, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on conceiuing, that so they should praeuaile still and hardly yet can learne any other, though often-times (God be thanked for it) it hath beene reasonably well beaten in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, or at least laid vpon them. When he was stirred vp by one of the Prophets, wee are to consider, first, in what sort hee was so stirred vp: then, what seruice it was that thereuppon hee farther did vnto the Lorde. The Prophet, whom it pleased the Lord in this seruice to vse, was <hi>Azariah</hi> or <hi>Obed</hi> (for by both those names he is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led) <note place="margin">2 Chr. 15: 1, 8</note> who, being specially endewed with the Spirite of God, came vnto Asa, and to all the people of <hi>Iudah</hi> and <hi>Beniamin</hi> (euen then, as it seemeth by the Text it selfe, when they returned to <hi>Hierusalem</hi> from the slaughter and spoyle of the <hi>Aethiopi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ibid. 14: 15. 15: 1.</note> for as it doth immediatly follow, so the limitation of the time there noted, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to haue reference thereunto) and notably dealt with them to that purpose: first crauing but audience of them; then comming to the matter it selfe. He craueth <note place="margin">Ibid. 15: 1, 2</note> audience both of the King himselfe, and of the people: it may be, to infinuate vnto them, that both sortes of them were diligently to imploy themselues in this dutie; and that neyther of them coulde well doe it without the other. Comming to the matter it selfe, for the most part of it hee is occupyed in teaching: but in the end hee falleth to exhortation. His doctrine consisteth of two principall braun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches: one, for that time praesent; the other, for the time ensuing. For that time praesent hee gaue them to vnderstand, that the Lorde was with them, now that they <note place="margin">Ibid. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> were with the Lord. For the time ensuing, hee diuideth that likewise into two seuerall braunches: first propounding them both; then farther confirming the latter of them. Those two branches themselues were, that if they would seeke the Lord; <note place="margin">Ibi 4. 2.</note> the LORD woulde bee found of them: but that, if they should forsake him; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> he also would then forsake them. He farther confirmeth the latter of them, by the example of their Brethren the kingdome of Israell. In whom likewise he noteth two thinges: first the estate of them all, by that theyr defection which they hadde made: then, that some of them neuerthelesse had sped better. The former of these first hee recyteth: then, when hee hath set downe the other also, hee trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth of it some-what farther. When he doth at the first but recite it, hee telleth <note place="margin">Ibid. 3.</note> them, that they had then for a long time beene, without the true GOD, aboue: and beneath, both without Priest to teach, and without the Law. Setting downe <note place="margin">Ibid. 4.</note> the other also, hee neuerthelesse addeth, that so many of them as returned in that theyr affliction to the Lord God of Israell, and sought him (as the Story hath shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <note place="margin">2 Chr. 11: 13-16.</note> vs already, that many of them did) he was found of them. Comming then to treat some-what farther of the former of these, hee sheweth them farther, that they <note place="margin">Ibid. 15: 5, 6</note> had no peace, but great trouble in all their wayes: for that one sort of them destroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed another; and GOD himselfe was disposed to trouble them with much aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie. Falling in the ende to exhortation, hee willeth them therefore to bee <note place="margin">Ibid. 7.</note> strong, and not to suffer theyr handes to bee weake: assuring them, that theyr woorke shoulde haue a reward. The seruice that thereuppon hee farther did
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:7530:229"/> vnto the Lord, was first to bring thinges to some better order than yet he had don: then, to leaue them so too, as might yeeld best hope so to stand for the time ensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. To bring things to some better order than yet he had done, being now far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">Ibid. 8.</note> encouraged by the Prophet, first he tooke away all the abominations that yet remained, not onely out of all the Land of <hi>Iudah</hi> and <hi>Beniamin;</hi> but also out of the Citties that hee had taken of Mount <hi>Ephraim:</hi> and then renewed the the Altar of the Lord, in the place to it appertaining. To leaue them so, as might yeeld best hope so to stand for the time ensuing, therein it is noted that both hee and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ioyned together: and so are we first, to consider of their assembling; then, what they did when they were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>ssembled. In their assembling wee haue noted vnto vs, in what sort they came together: and the time and place of that their assembly. To find in what sort they came together, that is first to be conceiued, which in the Text is last rehearsed; namely, that there fell many to him out of <hi>Israell,</hi> when they <note place="margin">Ibid 9.</note> saw that the Lord his God was with him: then is it to be taken in withall, that <hi>Asa</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> seeing them so to draw vnto him, gathered together, first all <hi>Iudah</hi> and <hi>Beniamin,</hi> and then such others of <hi>Ephraim, Manasseh,</hi> and <hi>Simeon,</hi> as came vnto him. The time and place of that their assembly, was, the fifteenth yeare of the raign of <hi>Asa:</hi> and at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> the onely place for that purpose, for which now they so assembled together. That which they did when they were there, was first well or in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable manner performed by them: and then in good manner likewise rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by God. It was well and commendably performed by them, both in respect of that which they did: and in respect of the affection wherewith they did it. That which they did, was first about oblations and sacrifices which then they offered: then, about a couenant that then they made. For their offerings it is saide, that <note place="margin">Ibid. 11.</note> they offered then vnto the Lord of the spoile of their enemies the <hi>Ethiopians,</hi> both Bullockes and sheeepe, of the Bullockes seauen hundred, and of the sheepe seauen thousand. The couenant that then they made, they first did make or agree vpon: then, ratified it likewise so well as they could. That which they agreed vpon, was, first for all themselues generally, that they would seeke the Lord the God of their <note place="margin">Ibid. 12, 13</note> Fathers, with all their heart, and with all their soule: then for others that would not, that they should bee put to death, whether they were small or great, man or woman. The latter of which, so farre as their example might iustly be example to others, would be strong against such recusancy, as among vs we finde to be lodged with many. The ratifying of it that then they vsed, was by Oath: solemnly and <note place="margin">Ibid. 14, 15</note> earnestly swearing, that they would truely performe that, whereon they had in this sort agreed. The affection wherewith they did it was great: themselues testify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the same by the great ioy they made withall, and the Text bearing them wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, <note place="margin">Ibid. Ibid. 15</note> that they did it with all their heart. Their reward for this was, that the Lord gaue them rest round about: a matter that experience teacheth is seldome gotten, by the deepest worldly wisedome that is; and yet heere in great measure obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, by vnfaigned turning vnto the Lord. What his infirmities were, and how it pleased God to deale with him about them, might easily be seene, but that the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is not cleered, vnto what time they may best be referred: a matter neuerthelesse that were not greatly materiall, but that the Text it selfe is not yet found to bee so cleere therein, but that the learned are of sundry opinions for that matter. So that in this part of his Story wee are not onely to consider of those his infirmities, the greatest part of his Story now remaining: but withall, of that circumstance of time besides, to know to what part of his raigne wee may best refer it. Comming to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> his infirmities, there are wee to consider what they were: and how it pleased God then to deale with him, in that latter part of his raigne. Of his infirmities one there is, that as it appertaineth to the former part of his raigne, so haue we by other occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and in other manner, noted it before: the others doe all appertaine to the time ensuing. That which belongeth to the former part of his raigne, which by other occasion we haue noted before, is, that he suffered some of those High places <note place="margin">1 King. 19: 14 2 Chr. 14: 5</note> still to remaine, of which notwithstanding hee destroyed many: as also it is there reported, that neuerthelesse his heart was vpright with the Lord all his daies. And
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:7530:229"/> true it is, that many good Princes, such I meane as haue many good things in them, and vnfaignedly are giuen to performe their partes in very good and honourable manner, neuerthelesse haue not that care to fetch theyr direction and light from whence they should, nor in such measure as to such purpose were to be wished: and that thereuppon it is, not onely among the Turkish and Heathen, but euen among Christians also (especially such as are intangled with the errours of the Church of <hi>Rome)</hi> that dyuers good Princes oft-times there are, who neuerthelesse come farre short of doing that good that themselues in some sort did ayme at. Those others that doe all appertaine to the time ensuing, are varrying in this: that one of them hath a propper chasticement thereto annexed; and none of the others so besides. That which hath a proper chasticement thereto annexed, giueth vs occasion to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, first of his fault, then of the chasticement that followed thereon. His fault was, <note place="margin">1 kin. 15: 17-19 2 Chr. 16: 1-3</note> that when <hi>Baasa</hi> the King of <hi>Israell</hi> came in strongly vppon him, and would so haue fortified against him as he did not like of, and yet thought himselfe to weake to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand him, hee sought vnto <hi>Benhadad</hi> the King of <hi>Syria</hi> for his helpe therein, and to that end sent him such praesents withall, so to obtaine his helpe the rather, as plainely declared that he stood in very great feare of him: sending vnto him, euen all the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of the House of the Lord, and all his owne treasure besides. His chasticement for this was, part of it plainely set downe: part of it as it were implyed. That which is plainely set downe, is, that by a Prophet of the Lord hee was plainely reprooued <note place="margin">2 Chr. 16: 7 9</note> for it, and some-thing threatned withall. Reprooued hee was for that therein hee sought for his helpe of the King of <hi>Syria,</hi> and not of the Lorde, which hee plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly told him was foolishly doone: especially when the Lord a little before had giuen him so plaine experience howe ready and able hee was to helpe him against that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> great power of the <hi>Aethiopians,</hi> when hee sought vnto him. Threatned hee was, <note place="margin">Ibid. 9.</note> that thence-foorth he should haue warres. That which was, but as it were implyed, was, that the Army of the <hi>Syrians</hi> which came to his helpe, were, as most of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters <note place="margin">Vulg. edit. Eyr. Vatab. Pellic, Pet. Martyr. Bibl. Angl. Tremel. Iun.</note> doe commonly reade, escaped his handes; as if, had hee sought vnto the Lorde, whereas the <hi>Syrians</hi> were confederate with the Israelites, and so were like to haue taken their part in that action, hee might so haue praeuayled against them both: others, with-drawne themselues from him, as not meaning to helpe him any more, though now they had serued his turne in this. Seeing therefore it is allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged as part of his chasticement, it dooth sufficiently imply, that eyther hee should haue praeuailed against them too, if hee had sought vnto the Lord, but shoulde not now: or else, at least, that hee should haue had farther helpe of them. But so doe ours also lightly speede, so oft as they seeke for helpe to such Straungers as those. Those others besides are such, as after a sort haue some reference to this, that we haue spoken of last: but one there is of another kinde. Those that wee may ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count to haue some reference to this that last we spake of, are two: one of them ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry plainly thereunto appertaining; the other standing indifferent in the Text, but yet so taken also by some. That which appertaineth plainely vnto it, is that Asa was so angry with the Prophet, that hee cast him in prison for it. And indeede it is not <note place="margin">Ibid. 10.</note> there sayde, that the Lorde did then send him about that matter; neyther dooth the Prophet then tell him, that he came vnto him in the name of the Lord, as also it may be, that being a Prophet, and not onely seeing the offence, but fore-seeing also what hurt would come of it, hee thought it his part so farre to discharge his duty therein; but (that wee reade of) had none other speciall calling vnto it. And then may we see in this, that men oft-times, though otherwise good, and of speciall commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation therein, yet can hardly abide to bee reprooued in theyr owne speciall wayes, euen by the best men that are, whom themselues will graunt to bee the vndoubted Seruants of God. Could the Prophet haue saide vnto him, thus saith the Lord, or as <hi>Samuell</hi> sayde to <hi>Saule,</hi> let mee tell thee what the Lord hath saide vnto me, or any such like, there is good hope, Asa being so well giuen as he was, that he would haue <note place="margin">1 Sa 15: 16</note> had more reuerence, and haue vsed more patience, though the message hadde beene much harder: but▪ as this case was, it was, left at liberty for Asa to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, that as men are men, euen the best that are, so might this man, though <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/>
               <pb n="436" facs="tcp:7530:230"/> indeede a Seer or Prophet, yet therein mingle some part of humaine perturbation with that his message; especially, if telling him it was foolishly doone, that word sounded any thing so hardly, or but so vnciuily with them, as it doth with vs. Out of which we may also learne, not onely such as are of the Ministery, but others also that are to reprooue, that we euer make sure that we take the word of God with vs, both for the matter, and for the manner of deliuery too: otherwise, that we may iust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly offend, euen the best that are, and leese the benefite of our reproofe. <hi>Asa</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding can no way (as I take it) be excused therein, the reproofe beeing so iust as it was, though the Lorde had not then sent him by any speciall or extraordinary manner, being known as he was to be a Seer; and though being a man, subiect to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity as others are, he mingled some strain of his own perturbation therwith: sauing onely vnlesse the King, duly reuerencing both the message it selfe, and the function and person of the Prophet, espying some inordinate dealing in it, did lay his chasty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing hand onely thereon, and that in good and orderly manner. For in such case there is no quaestion, but that Kinges may, yea and of duty ought to punish or cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, euen the greatest Prophetes that at any time are, vnlesse there bee some other cause for which to spare them; as, least so they should lead theyr people not to haue that due regard to their doctrine, and them that ought to haue: in all which ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, the lesser euill is rather to be quietly passed ouer, than a greater to be admitted or letten in. But in this case that now wee are in, there is another matter in such sort, or so closely ioyned to this, that thereby they should seeme to be both of one nature: and sure we are, that that other was hard dealing indeede; and so boadeth this to be too, one way or other. That which standeth indifferent in the Text, but yet is so taken by some, is, that other hard dealing that last we spake of, as ioyning very close<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to this: namely, that <hi>Asa</hi> then also put to death (for so doe some reade) or at least <note place="margin">Ibid. 10.</note> oppressed diuers of the people, or dealt hardly with them one way or other; &amp; those are by some taken to bee, such as misliked that his dealing with the Prophet. And <note place="margin">Pet. Martyr.</note> indeede that is a case, which experience oft reneweth, that whensoeuer the iust are by the mightier sort ouerlaid, then must all others eyther vtterly forsake their neede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and iust defence: or if any cannot find in their harts so to do, they must then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine with themselues to suffer with them. That which was of another kind, was, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> that towardes his old age, or towardes the ende of his raigne, beeing much diseased <note place="margin">1 King. 15: 23 2 Chr. 16: 12</note> in his feete (which also is taken to haue beene the Gout, but it might bee some other disease besides) though his disease were extreame vpon him, yer he sought not to the Lord for his help therein, but to the Phisitians: which being in him so plainly repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, doth as plainly teach vs, that such as are of speciall cōmendation in godlines may neuerthelesse somtime be greatly distressed, and yet not remember to seek vnto God; and though secondary causes are not to bee neglected, and may bee vsed, yet are we in all such cases, first to seeke vnto God, and then to come to those other secondary helpes, that hee hath vouchsafed (for the releefe of our necessities) to giue vnto vs. How it pleased God to deale with him in this latter part of his raigne, when these in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities brake forth in him, we are so much the rather to consider, that so we may take the instruction thereof to our selues likewise. And so if wee marke, wee may find, that God most of all touched or laid his hand on the whole state: and partly, on his owne person withall. On the whole State first it seemeth, hee laid, that it should not come to that greatnesse, that otherwise it should haue doone: then it is certaine, that he made it to be troublesome vnto them. It seemeth he laide vppon it, that it should not come to that greatnesse that otherwise it should haue doone▪ in that the Hoast of the <hi>Syrians</hi> was now escaped out of his handes: implying as it seemeth, as <note place="margin">2 Chr. 16: 7</note> we saw before, that otherwise he should haue praeuailed against them also. Which had beene a great augmentation to their State, if then they could prosecute the same accordingly; as had beene a likely matter for them to doe, when once they had prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed against their Army or forces of them: especially, when as it was no more than God had promised before vnto them, nor than <hi>Dauid</hi> also and <hi>Salomon</hi> had; nor all <note place="margin">Deut. 11. 24 Ios. 1: 4. 2 Sa. 8: 5, 6. 1 King. 4: 21</note> that neyther. Certaine it is, that hee made the State to bee troublesome vnto them, in that there was so long warre betwixt the Kingdome of <hi>Israell</hi> and them, euen all
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:7530:230"/> the time that <hi>Baasa</hi> and <hi>Asa</hi> liued together. That wherewithall his owne person <note place="margin">1 Kings. 15. 16, 32. 2 Chr. 16: 9. 1 King. 15▪ 23 2 Chr. 16: 12.</note> was touched, was, that disease that in his old age he had in his feete, which as it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, began with him about two yeares before his death, and did hold him very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamely, till at length it tooke him away. And true it is, euen with vs also, such States I mean as professe the Gospell, that, by likelyhood, some of them might haue com'd ere this to haue beene much greater than otherwise they haue attayned vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, if in such sort they had sought the Lorde as they ought to haue doone: whereas <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="L"/> for the want thereof, they haue not onely missed of that encrease, but withall haue found more warre than otherwise they were like to haue doone; and haue beene shapely touched in theyr owne persons besides. A warning sufficient to those that follow.</p>
            <p n="4">4 To what part of his raigne these infirmities of his might best be referred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> now to consider, there is no quaestion but that they all appertaine to the latter time of his raigne: but where that latter part of his raigne should begin, that is the thing that is hardest to be decided. The difficultie is this. First, it is sayd, that <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asa</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Kings. 14: 28, 33. Ibid. 16, 32.</note> beganne his raigne ouer <hi>Israell,</hi> in the third yeare of <hi>Asa,</hi> and that hee raigned foure and twenty yeares: then also, that there was warre betweene <hi>Asa</hi> and <hi>Baasa</hi> all their dayes, or so long as they both liued together. It seemeth likewise that the Text it selfe dooth note, that the beginning of this warre was, that <hi>Baasha</hi> the King of <hi>Israell</hi> began to fortifie in <hi>Ramah,</hi> to hinder the passage of his people to the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>Iudah.</hi> For, when first it is said, that there was warre betwixt them al their <note place="margin">Ibid. 16, 27</note> daies; then it followeth immediatly after, that <hi>Baasha</hi> did so fortifie in <hi>Ramah:</hi> and vnlesse the warres had begunne with the raigne of <hi>Baasa,</hi> there could not haue bin warres betwixt them all the time while they both raigned together. So by this rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning, <note place="margin">Ibid. 16: 8.</note> the warres betwixt them should haue begunne in the third yeare of <hi>Asa,</hi> and not haue ended till the death of <hi>Baasha,</hi> which a little after is noted to be, by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming in of <hi>Elah</hi> his Sonne vpon the death of his Father, in the sixe and twentith year of the raigne of <hi>Asa.</hi> Whereby it appeareth, that the raigne of <hi>Baasha,</hi> and the wars betwixt them, began with the beginning of the third yeare of <hi>Asa,</hi> and ended with the expiration or ending of the 26. yeare of <hi>Asa</hi> his raigne. Whereupon it must follow, that that infirmity of <hi>Asa,</hi> in seeking to the King of <hi>Syria</hi> for help against the King of Israell, was about the very beginning of the third year of Asa his raigne. But then else-where it is saide, that <hi>Asa</hi> comming to the crowne, the Land was quiet ten <note place="margin">2 Chr. 14: 1, 6, 7.

Generally it is <note place="margin">Ibid. 3, 5, 12</note> sayde, that the Lord was with him; and that the Lord established the kingdome in his hand: as also, that (thereby) he prospered and grew vp on high. More speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally we haue some things set downe but briefely: but some others somewhat more largely. Briefely it is saide, that he had riches and honour in abundance; &amp; some <note place="margin">Ibid. 5. &amp; 18: 1</note> good part of his Riches or Treasure is noted to come by the good will of his owne people bringing presents vnto him. That which wee haue set downe some-what more largely, is as touching his prouision against the enemy, which wee haue deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered vnto vs, first for the strength of his Citties; then, in the greatnesse of his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. For the strength of his Citties, it is sayde, that he had great workes in them, <note place="margin">2 Chr. 17: 2, 13. Ibid. 14-19</note> and that he did put Garrisons in all the strong Cities of <hi>Iudah,</hi> and in <hi>Ierusalem:</hi> and that he set bands in the Land of <hi>Iudah,</hi> and in those Citties of <hi>Ephraim,</hi> which Asa his Father had taken. For the strength of his Army, it is noted likewise, that hee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> had great forces in a readynesse vnder the leading of diuers seueral Captains: some of <hi>Iudah;</hi> otherr of <hi>Beniamin.</hi> Ouer the forces of <hi>Iudah</hi> he had three Captaynes: two of them of no speciall note (but that no doubt they were valiant and woorthy men;) but one, of speciall note besides.

But this must needes bee a speciall blessing, that hee now by his owne forces praeuailed against them, when as Asa his Father accounted himselfe so vnable to withstand them, that he gaue all his owne treasure, and the treasure of the house of the Lord too, to the <hi>Syrians</hi> to help him against them, as already we haue seene. The <hi>Edomites</hi> were neere to them also, not so much for that they came of <hi>Esau</hi> the Sonne of <hi>Iacob;</hi> but much rather for that from <hi>Dauids</hi> time they were subiect to this Kingdome: and of those it is said, that as yet there was no King among them, but that the Deputy was <note place="margin">1 King. 22: 47</note> as King; so to note, that as yet they also were subiect vnto <hi>Iehoshaphat.</hi> Comming to those others that were meere strangers vnto them, the Story speaketh, first of all generally: then, of certaine of them more specially.

That one thing that he did commendably also many yeares after, was towardes the end of <hi>Ahabs</hi> raigne, &amp; about the seauenteenth yeare of his owne: at such time as he ioyned with <hi>Ahab</hi> in battell against the <hi>Syrians.</hi> For at that time, when <hi>Ahab</hi> would haue set forward in that expedition without inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring <note place="margin">1 King. 22: 5. 2 Chr. 18: 4.</note> of the Lord, he first mooued him to take the Lords aduise with them first: and againe when he saw that the King of <hi>Israell</hi> sought no farther but onely to his owne Prophets, hee both got a Prophet of the Lord to bee sent for, and when hee saw his <note place="margin">1 King. 22: 7, 8 2 Chr. 18: 6, 7</note> Lord was offended with him, he sought to pacifie him, and to haue better opinion of him. By which also he did not leese. For though he was indeede in great danger (the enemies making very forcibly towardes him) and the King of <hi>Israell</hi> himselfe <note place="margin">1. Kings. 22: 32, 33. 2 Chro. 18: 31, 32 19: 1. 2 Chr. 19: 1</note> was slaine in the field: yet was God so mercifull to him, that he escaped and returned safe to <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> Stirred-vp he was by the Prophet, after that he was returned safe to <hi>Ierusalem</hi> from the field that <hi>Ahab</hi> lost to the <hi>Syrians:</hi> wherein againe we are to consider, not onely what good seruice it was that then he did; but withall, that soon after wee haue mention made of so great fauour on him bestowed, as that it may seeme, it was to reward that seruice of his. His seruice was, that againe hee set in <note place="margin">Ibid. 4.</note> hand with bettering his State, both to the aduancement of Religion, and good of the people, first himselfe reducing his people to some good order: then vsing good meanes to keepe them therein. Himselfe reduced them to some good order, vsing <note place="margin">Ibid. 4.</note> as it were, a Regall Visitation, for the generall reformation of all the Land: going throughout al the land euen from <hi>Beersheba</hi> to Mount <hi>Ephraim,</hi> and bringing backe the people againe vnto the Lord God of their Fathers. The meanes that he vsed to keepe them therein, was, to establish good gouernment among them: and that he did, first for euery Citty by it selfe; then, by appointing another ouer the whole. For euery Citty by it selfe, he ordained speciall Iudges: &amp; gaue them great charge, <note place="margin">Ibid. 5-7.</note> diligently to see to their Office, and to performe it in the best manner that they were able. That other that he appointed ouer the whole, was at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> the <note place="margin">Ibid. 8-11</note> head Citty of the Kingdome; and it was an higher Court aboue the others, for such matters as could not be decided, by the other Iudges at home: such a Court as God <note place="margin">Deut. 17: 8-13</note> himselfe before appointed vnto his people, to take final order for al such cases whē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer they should arise; and ordained death for those that would not bee ruled thereby. That great fauour whereof we haue mention so soone after, that it may seeme it was to reward that seruice of his, was a notable and strange deliueraunce from a great power of enemies that came in against him.

The goodnesse of God notwithstanding towardes his people was such, that first putting into their heartes to seeke vnto him, hee then gaue them great and honourable successe against them, theyr Enemies falling at such varyance among themselues, and so slaughtering one another, that <hi>Iehoshaphat</hi> and his company needed not to strike one stroke; and were no farther troubled there-with, but onely in sounding their praysings to God, and (when the Enemies had done among themselues) in gathering in their spoile to Hierusalem, which also was so much, that it cost them three dayes labour.

Those things wherein he was not so well aduised, but in which he was faulty, are of two sorts: one of them, a defect in that reformation he made among the people; others, all appertaining to a slip that himselfe did make in his owne waies. That defect that we find in the reformation he made among the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, is the same that we something noted before: namely, that he tooke not away all <note place="margin">1 King. 22: 43</note> the high places, but, as it seemeth, in <hi>Iudah;</hi> and else-where left many of them yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining. In those others that are al appertaining to a slip that himself did make in his own waies, we are first to consider of that slip it selfe: then of other things depending thereon. That slip it selfe was such a thing, as wherein hee followed very plainely the course of the World, or the direction of flesh and bloud: namely, that the <hi>Israelites</hi> being so far falne from the true worship of God as they were, and King <hi>Ahab</hi> being giuen (by the meanes of <hi>Iesabell</hi> his Wife) to much Idolatry besides, neuerthelesse he married his eldest Son <hi>Iehoram,</hi> who was to succeed him in the kingdom, vnto <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia</hi>

A very great ouer-sight in him that so professed Religion him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe: so to sow the Seeds with his owne hands of so manifest danger of so soule re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoulting from God as that might boad, euen in the next generation of al. But so easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly may the best men of all forget themselues: &amp; the cause of religion is on all hands so slenderly regarded; euen by the rarest patrons that lighly it hath. Those other things depending hereon, were all but a bitter fruit; and yet but the fruit of his owne waies: but yet so arising or growing, as that all came not to the Sickle in his time; but much of it came dropping in after. That which came to the Sickle in his time, or the fruite that himselfe did eate of, was partly in the dayes of <hi>Achab</hi> himselfe, with whom hee made this vnaduised affinity: and partly, in the dayes of one of his Sonnes.

Else had hee done but like an Hypocrite, so to enquire for some Prophet of the Lorde: and then, not to regard his word when he heard it. But so many good men be entangled by worldlie frienshippe; themselues seeing they are led to that which they should not; and yet, hauing no heart to withstand it. That which was a speciall danger vnto his person, was, that still holding on his purpose to goe with him, when once the battailes were ioyned, not onely the King of Israell himselfe was slaine, but he also was in such danger, that <note place="margin">1. Kings. 22: 32, 37. 2. Chro. 18: 31. 34. 2 Chr. 19: 2, 3</note> hee cryed out and fled, and so was dishonourably beaten out of the fielde: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides all this, being come home, he was roundly reproued by the Prophet <hi>Iehu</hi> for it, and giuen to vnderstand, that the Lorde was so offended with him, for helping the wicked, that hee needed not thinke it strange that he was so foyled, and that he was more likely cleane to haue perished, but that diuers good thinges beeing found in him, the Lord dealt mercifully with him therein.

That which came in by <hi>Iehoram,</hi> his owne Son, was, that so soone as hee was established in his Kingdome, hee, euen hee, and not a stranger, slew all his <note place="margin">2 Chr. 21: 1-4</note> Bretheren, being sixe, the Sonnes of <hi>Iehoshaphat</hi> aswell as himselfe: whom <hi>Iehosha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phat</hi> had tendred much, and placed well. But so belike it was meete in the iustice of God; that seeing he regarded so little to match his Sonne in so naughty a stocke; his owne yssue should so readily finde the inconuenience of it. That which came in by that Daughter in Lawe of his, for whom and by whom this affinity was, hath two maine branches of mischiefe: one, that on a small occasion she destroyed all the <note place="margin">2 King. 11: 1-3 2.

His Story dooth fitly deuide it selfe into two principall partes: first, how he offended; then, how hee was punished or chasticed for it. His offence was most part of it in corruption of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: but some part of it in tyranny also. That part of it that was in corruption of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, was, first (but generally) that he did euill in the sight of the Lord, not therein <note place="margin">2 King 1: 18 2 Chr. 21: 6 Ibid. &amp; 13.</note> shewing any particular wherein he did so ill: but then more specially he is noted, that hauing <hi>Ahabs</hi> Daughter to Wife, hee walked in the waies of the Kinges of Israell, euen as did the house of <hi>Ahab;</hi> and, not so content, made high-places in the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines <note place="margin">2 Chr. 21: 11, 13.</note> of <hi>Iudah,</hi> and compelled the Inhabitants of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> and all <hi>Iudah</hi> there to worship. That other part which was in tyranny, was, that whereas he had many bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theren besides, the Sonnes of <hi>Iehoshaphat</hi> as well as himselfe, which also were better <note place="margin">Ibid. 2-4. 13</note> than he; whom his Father while yet he liued, had honorably and richly placed in cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine strong Citties of Iudah, but giuing the kingdome onely to him as being his el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest: after that he had made himselfe strong, or established himselfe in his kingdom, then did hee destroy both those his brethren, and many of the Princes of Iudah be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides. His punishment or chasticement that ensued thereon, was not great in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison, and mingled much with gracious lenity. For though he had now iustly deserued to be cut off also, yet seeing he had slaine all his Bretheren, so that himselfe onely was <note place="margin">Ibid. 7.</note> left of that line, and God had promised long before, that hee would not vtterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy the House of <hi>Dauid:</hi> therefore God would not now destroy him also, but spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him because of the couenant that he had made with <hi>Dauid</hi> before. Yet both at this praesent he laide some chasticement on him: and did likewise threaten him more. The chasticement that now he laid vpon him, was yet but in such as were in subiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vnto him: and those were, the <hi>Edomites</hi> yet; and his owne people besides. The chasticement that hee had in the <hi>Edomites,</hi> was, that now they rebelled: and yet it <note place="margin">2 kin 8: 20-22 2 chr. 21. 8-10 2 King. 8: 22 2 Chr. 21: 10 2 Chr. 21: 20</note> pleased God to giue him a good reuenge on them; though thereby he did not bring them backe to their allegiance again. In his owne people the chasticement that God did lay on him, was, first by one Citty, <hi>Libnah,</hi> in the borders of his kingdom, which now also rebelled against him: then, by all the people generally, that they had no li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of him, and so no desire to enioy him. That which hee threatned farther vnto him, was afterward likewise performed. Threatened or denounced it was vnto him, in so rare and strange manner, that some force hath bin offered to the Text it selfe, to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> make the matter to accord to the time. For he was thus threatned, or had those iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments denounced vnto him from the Lorde himselfe, by the ministery of <hi>Elias,</hi> by a writing or letter that came from him to <hi>Iehoram</hi> the King: and yet notwithstanding, <hi>Elias</hi> was taken vp a good while before.

A third opinion there is, which in my iudgment is much the likelier, &amp; noted by diuers: but it seemeth strange, that it shold be but thought on onely &amp; not commended, or noted as the likeliest of them; but so to be lest at large as they are. For there is no quaestion, but that <hi>Elias,</hi> by the Spirite that was in him, might fore-see that, as well as hee did many other thinges besides: and to great purpose it was (to make it so much the plainer to all, that his Ministery was of God) that hee should set it downe while he was on earth among them, to bee deliuered vnto the King, what time hee should haue doone those thinges that the Prophet had there fore-shewed that hee should doe; so, by fore-shewing those his base imployments, the more to assure him of those iudgement also. And seeing the Scriptures doe not vse to teach vs, to depend (for farther instruction) on Saintes departed (but <hi>Lyranus</hi> indeede, might in those dayes bee so farre distempered in that perswasion, that it may bee no maruell if hee contented him-selfe there-with) nor simply to tearme one Ptophet by the Name of another, vnlesse there bee
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:7530:235"/> some farther reach (as in tearming <hi>Iohn Baptist, Elias;)</hi> but one the other side, are euer carefull to leaue vnto vs the Ministery of the true seruants of God, in good credit, or well confirmed vnto vs: hence may we probably gather, first that none other way can we make so good vse thereof, as so to take it; then also, that neither of the other stand so warranted or consonant to other Scripture, as this that wee speake off. That which is denounced vnto him in the name of the Lord, by that <note place="margin">Ibid. 12-15.</note> Epistle or writing that from <hi>Elias</hi> was deliuered vnto him, was, that because him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe did so corruptly professe, and had corrupted others so much thereby; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of those detestable Murthers by him committed: hee also must bee roundly punnished for it, both in such as belonged vnto him, and in his owne person too. Performed it was, first in such as belonged vnto him: then, in his owne person also: Of such as belonged vnto him, first the Land, it selfe and his treasure is mentioned: then certaine persons neere vnto him. Of the Land it is saide, that the <hi>Philistims,</hi> and certaine of the <hi>Arabians</hi> (stirred vp also by God himselfe) brake into the Land <note place="margin">Ibi. 16, 17. 22▪</note> (and then were they like to deale accordingly with it) &amp; of this treasure, that they tooke away with them all the Kings substance or treasure (and then were they not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> likely to spare others:) of those that were neere vnto him (his Sonnes and Wiues) likewise that they tooke away and slew all, sauing that they left him one onely son, and the same the youngest. Of his person it is said likewise, that the Lord smote <note place="margin">Ibid. 18, 19.</note> him with an incurable disease in his bowels, so that after two yeares his very Guts fell out by the reason of that his disease, and so hee died by that, it seemeth, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sore diseases ioyned therewith: and was sunke withall into so deepe dislike with his people, that wheras now they had takē vp a custome to be at the charges of much spices to be consumed, and burnt at the funerall of their Kings, now did they no such matter for him. An example not to be lightly regarded, that euen Kings can haue no good-will nor honour in the hearts of their subiects, but in the Lord: and that, euen they also, notwithstanding their good auncesters before, and their owne greatnesse after, if needes they will any way make themselues publique of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenses to others, they may not thinke much if they be made examples to others also of some fearefull and publique reuenge.</p>

In which two places, aptly to reconcile them together, is another of his difficulties that we spake of before: and yet, both before and after, reconciled by others. But as touching the substance of his Story, it is no more in effect but that he also did ill in the eies of the Lord; and was accordingly punnished for it. The euill that hee did in the eies of the Lord, was, that he walked in the waies of the house of <hi>Ahab;</hi> and there be two reasons giuen why so he did: one, that his Mother (being ill dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed her selfe) did counsell him to do wickedly; the other, that they of the house of <hi>Ahab</hi> were his Counsellers, and that he was ruled by them. One thing there is so noted of him, as seemeth to import, that he was ruled by them in that likewise: which was, that he also associated himselfe to his Vnckle <hi>Iehoram</hi> the King of <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raell,</hi> in his warfare against the <hi>Syrians;</hi> the like fault that his Grand-Father <hi>Iehosha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phat</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> had made before, though he at that time escaped better than his Grand-Father did. The punnishment hee had, is first set downe but generally: but then more specially also. Generally it is noted to be his destruction: a iust end for such as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low <note place="margin">Ibid. 4.</note> so bad Counsellers; and not very vnmeete neither, for such as goe no farther than to haue such about them, though they thinke to take heede of following of them. More specially it is noted, how he came to that destruction of his: and first as it came vnto him from aboue; then, as it came vnto him from beneath. As it came vnto him from aboue, it is plainely noted, that it came of God: a good war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <note place="margin">Ibid. 7.</note> to those that doe ill, that God casteth, in his good time, how to meete with

As it came to him from beneath, by the secondary causes which God had or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, whereby to accomplish his iudgements on him, it is noted, that he came iust in the way of <hi>Iehu,</hi> and at such time as he was come to do execution on the house of <hi>Ahab</hi> (of which he was one) both himselfe and many others of his neerest kindred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides: <note place="margin">2 King. 9: 16, 27 10: 12-14 <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

But as this woman was but an vsurper, and came not vnto it but by bloud: so she did not enioy it long, and made some part of sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction to the bloud of others, by her own bloud also. And being an vsurper as she was, we haue no Story of her gouernment (belike because she was an vsurper, as not vouchsafing to attribute any gouernment vnto her, seeing shee had no right to the place) but only of some doing of others to her appertaining: and how she was depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed againe. But though we haue no Story of her gouernment, yet notwithstanding, if our selues doe but a little consider what it was that now she did, we may soone per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue that she did very ill: first interrupting a speciall ordinance of God hefore; then, that so she behaued her selfe as she did, to attaine to her owne desire therein. She in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted a special ordinance of God before, in that she vsurped to raign there, where God before had giuen the Scepter to the Tribe of <hi>Iudah;</hi> and afterward also, of all that Tribe, peculiarly to the line of <hi>Dauid:</hi> her selfe being a meere stranger to them both. To attaine to her owne desire therein, she likewise did very ill, in that she so stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to come to that place, whereunto she had no calling at all: vtterly destroying, so nere as she could, all that were of the roial blood; herselfe hauing had a Father in law, an husband, &amp; some issuing thereof. In those others to her appertaining we are, not onely to consider, what it was that they did: but withall, who it may seeme they were that there are spoken of. That which they did, was, that they brake vp the house of <note place="margin">2 Chr. 24: 7.</note> God: &amp; all the things that were dedicated for the house of the Lord, they did bestow vpon <hi>Baalim,</hi> their Idols. God be thanked we haue not such kind of Idols among vs now: but such we had when time was; and some we haue, of another kinde, in place of them yet. When we had such Idols among vs, we also, for many of vs, after a sort brake vp the house of God, and imploied those Church-liuings that were giuen to the maintenance of the Gospell, to the vse and maintenance of Popish Idolatry: and now that we haue no such Idols, we apply many of them to prophane vses, to the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of our selues and ours. Who they were, that heerein are spoken of, we had neede to consider, first on behalfe of <hi>Athaliah:</hi> then on behalfe of those her Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. On behalfe of <hi>Athaliah</hi> we had need to do it, for that it seemeth the Text doth attribute no more vnto her, but onely that she was a bad woman: &amp; not that she was <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> one of those had their hands in that sacriledge; but that it was her children only. And yet most of our translations do ioyne her &amp; her children in that action together, <note place="margin">Vulg. edit. Lyr. Con Pellic. Fr. Vatab. Bibl. Angl. Tremel. Iun.</note> as indeed it is (by her disposition) a thing likely enough: but others there be, that do rather ascribe it onely to her Children. On the behalfe of her Children it is neede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to be considered, so to giue the Story thereof his due place as touching the time.
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:7530:236"/> For this is related, as appertaining to the time of her vsurped raigne ouer <hi>Iudah:</hi> but at that time she had no Children, those being slaine a little before by <hi>Iehu;</hi> or (which is not so likely) by her owne selfe, immediatly after that slaughter that <hi>Iehu</hi> made, and before her selfe began her vsurped raigne. And if she had others by a former Husband (but then had she not beene so meete for the marriage of a King) or if she had others by abuse of her selfe in Wedlocke (as indeede she was a bad Woman in Idolatry, and experience teacheth vs, that our Idolaters of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> are, of all others among vs, the most loose in that kinde of vice:) yet the word of God beeing so plaine as it is, that hee would vtterly roote out the posterity of <hi>Ahab,</hi> and wee hauing no Story of any slaughter of this part of them (in the Kings of <hi>Iudah,</hi> I meane) but onely those two, till we come to the the slaughter of <hi>Athaliah</hi> herselfe; heereby it seemeth, that although the Story of this sacriledge bee heere remembred, yet that it belonged to a former time, as to the dayes of <hi>Iehoram</hi> or <hi>Ahaziah.</hi> But whensoeuer it was done, and whether her selfe stood cleere of it or not, the Text is plaine that done it was, and that her Children had their handes in it. As touching her deposing againe, wee are first to consider the occasion of it: then, in what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner it was performed. The occasion was, that whereas shee was a wrongfull vsur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, there was one yet remaining, to whom the Crowne did by right appertaine: wherein first wee are to consider of the Story it selfe, how that one was praeserued; then of another thing thereof arising. That one was praeserued by the High-Priests <note place="margin">2 King. 11: 1-3 2 Chr. 22: 10-12.</note> Wife, being the Daughter of <hi>Iehoram</hi> the late King, who beeing mooued by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion to see so many of her neere Kinsfolke slaughtered, and belike beeing by her Parentage so friended among them, that shee had good meanes to doe it, conuayed away one little Child that should haue beene slaine with the rest, together with his Nurse, and kept them secret sixe yeares together. That other thing that ariseth heereof, is as touching that marriage of the High-Priest: this being a plaine testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, not onely that the High-Priest was then a married man (as also they were all in a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> manner;) but withall, that then the Priest-hood it seemeth was in that reuerence and honour, that they were accounted sufficient matches for the best sort of them. The performance of it was, that the High-Priest, in the seauenth yeare after, so acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <note place="margin">2 Kin. 11: 4-16 2 Chr 23: 1-15</note> certaine of the Nobles of <hi>Iudah</hi> therewith, made such prouision, and tooke such order, that on the suddaine <hi>Ioash</hi> that Childe, called also <hi>Iehoash,</hi> the rightfull heire, was proclaimed King, and <hi>Athaliah</hi> the vsurper there-withall slaine, as before shee had deserued in the slaughter of others: and hauing so doone, they altogether ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish such thinges as did appertaine to the establishing of the King in his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, to the reioycing of all the people; and both the people on the one side destroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <note place="margin">2 King. 11: 17-20. 2 Chro. 23: 16-21.</note> the House of <hi>Baal,</hi> together with the Priest and other things thereunto appertay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and the High Priest tooke praesent order for the Temple and seruice of God to haue the same from that time forward orderly done.</p>
            <p n="9">9 The vsurper being thus remooued, and her Pageant beeing in this sort playde, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> God also himselfe hauing thus farre laid his admonishing hand, both vpon the Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Iudah,</hi> and Line of <hi>Dauid,</hi> wee are now to consider of the rest of their time, so long as the kingdome of Israell stood, when God of his goodnesse now restored both the Scepter of Iudah, and the Line of <hi>Dauid</hi> to the Crown among them again. But though now he eased them of this kinde of chasticement, it was not long, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they much forgot themselues againe: and so occasioned him to giue vnto them that sharper warning that before we spake of, the casting off (for euer) of theyr Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren the Children of Israell. In which compasse of time it is plaine, that once God did set them vppe againe, and as it were gaue them good footing, that so they might stand better if they would: and when they neuerthelesse in their infirmity did fall, then did he recouer them also yet once more. So are wee first to consider, how ill they kept their standing when now they were set vp: then, how they were notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing againe recouered. How ill they kept theyr standing now, when they were againe set vp, that we may the better finde, we are first to consider of this their setting vp: and afterward, of their standing therein. Set vp they were, by him that nowe
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:7530:236"/> succeeded next, in the first part of his raigne, so long as <hi>Iehoiada</hi> the High-Priest ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued: which how long it was, or how many yeares of his raigne were spent therein, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ioash.</hi> 8.</note> we haue not specified vnto vs. But considering that hee came to the kingdome, as we heard before, but a very Child, when he was but seauen yeare old, and for a time <note place="margin">2 King. 11: 21 2 Chr. 24: 1</note>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> was vnder the gouernment of <hi>Iehorada</hi> the High-Priest, some part of that good which in his time was done, and vnto him is commonly attributed, is chiefely to bee ascribed (vnder God) to those that were his gouernors then: and yet the education that then he had, wrought so well with him, that himselfe also was well occupyed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and so of right must haue part of the good that in his time was done, to himselfe ascribed. In that which is chiefely to be ascribed to his gouernors then (next, and immedialy vnder God) it shall not bee amisse, first to see what the same was: then, how to apply it to our selues. It was, that in all his raigne of forty yeares, we finde not any part of his better gouernment that is to be ascribed vnto <hi>Iehoiada,</hi> but onely so much as was done at the first, when first the King was brought to his Kingdome: and that which afterward is onely in generall tearmes deliuered vnto vs. In that which was done at the first, wee haue noted vnto vs, not onely what the thing it selfe was: but some effectes withall that followed thereon. The thing it selfe was, if we marke, first, to bring all againe vnto God: then, to settle some good order among themselues. To bring all againe vnto God, it was, that the former couenant was made betwixt the Lord on the one party, and the King and the people on the other <note place="margin">2 King. 11▪ 1▪ 2 Chr. 23: 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
               </note> party: which was, that they should thence-forward be the Lordes people. To set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle good order among themselues, first they began with Soueraigne power, which was to ioyne altogether in one: and then came to Diuine Seruice, or to the publique worshippe of God. As touching Soueraigne power, it was, that the second coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant was made, that which was betwixt the King and the people (that the King <note place="margin">2 King. 11: 1:</note> should well and orderly gouerne: and that the people should dutifully obey:) and then, that accordingly they did place him, in publique and solemne manner, in the <note place="margin">Ibid. 19. 2 Chr. 23: 20 2 King. 11: 18 2. Chro. 23: 18, 19.</note> Throne of the Kingdome. As touching Diuine Seruice, or the publique worship of God, <hi>Iehoiada</hi> tooke order likewise, that thinges should bee doone according to the Lawe of God and ordinance of <hi>Dauid:</hi> and appoinred Warders and Porters to the House of the Lorde, for the better accomplishment of diuers seruices there to be done. These effectes that wee haue noted withall that followed thereon, were, that the Land was quiet now, when that vsurpation was thus abolished: and, that all <note place="margin">2 King 11: 20 2 Chr. 23: 21</note> the people greatly reioyced. That which is afterward onely in generall tearmes deliuered vnto vs, is, that all the dayes of <hi>Iehoiada,</hi> or so long as the King tooke his <note place="margin">2 King. 12. 2 2 Chr. 24: 2, 14</note> direction from him, both the King did that which was good in the sight of the Lord: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> and the publique Seruice of GOD was duly obserued. How wee may apply this Story vnto our selues, is, for some part of it, reasonable plaine; but some other thing there is againe, that it may be, would not bee so easily espyed. That which is reasonable plaine, is, that Princes and all other Superiours doe then gouerne best, when they take theyr direction from those that are best exercised in the word of GOD, beeing withall iudicious and zealous on the behalfe of Gods glory: and on the other side, the lesse that they regard to take theyr dyrection thence, the moe errours doe they commit, and the more they bring themselues in daunger of the righteous iudgements of God. That, which it may be, would not so easily be espyed, is, that the like hath beene done of late among vs, that was then doone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them. For as it was the High-Priest and his Wife then (the marriage of that order beeing then so tendered, that he was vouchsafed to marry in great bloud) by whom it pleased God then to praeserue the royall Seede; and, when conuenient time was come, to bring him foorth, to the vtter ruine of that wrongfull vsurpation which was gotten into the place then: so in these daies also it hath pleased God, by the Ministery, to praeserue that most roiall Seed of God, the Lord of Lords, and King of Kinges, the Scepter of Iudah and Line of <hi>Dauid,</hi> to whom onely vnder the Father, the right of all Kingdoms do originally appertaine, &amp; in the time that the wisdome of God had to that end appointed, to bring him forth to the vtter ruine of that Strum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet of <hi>Babylon,</hi> our late <hi>Athalia,</hi> hauing then gotten the place, and tyra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="450" facs="tcp:7530:237"/> vs at her pleasure; especially among those, where the marriage of that sort had bin vouchsafed that regard that is due vnto it. That which arose of <hi>Ioas</hi> himself, &amp; out of the education that before he had, but yet notwithstanding may iustly be to him as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed, was (that we read of) only about repairing &amp; getting in a readines the house of the Lord to such vse as wherunto it was before ordained; and about this we find him to be occupied twice: first, giuing charge thereof to the Priests &amp; Leuites; then after himself also dealing with it. What time he gaue charge therof to the Priests &amp; Leuites, we haue not noted; but by the order of the Texte it seemeth, that it was long, before he did it; for that he had married two wiues before: but sure it is, that <note place="margin">2 Chr. 24: 3. 4</note> some time or other he did it; and therein it is plain, that he had a care of the Howse of God, though, it seemeth to me, nothing so great as he ought to haue had, nor as some perswade themselues of him. For at this time (for ought that we reade) he <note place="margin">2 King. 12: 4. 5 2 Chr. 24: 5.</note> laide the burthen heereof onely vpon the Priests and Leuites: and the charges to be raised out of the purses of the people. It appertained indeed to the Priests and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Leuites, to haue speciall care about that businesse, and it may be there was some ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour giuen them therein, at least, that so they would seem to do: but, after so great decay going before, in the dayes of <hi>Iehoram, Ahaziah,</hi> and <hi>Athalia,</hi> and after so long a pause in this King now, to lay it onely on the purses of the people, and to make the Priests and Leuites to be the gatherers of it, when it might be so plainely intended, that it was their owne businesse withall, was no such course, as I do take it, as a sound and ready zeale would then haue vsed. And seeing it is plainly said, that afterward it came into <hi>Ioas</hi> his minde, to repaire the house of the Lorde, wee <note place="margin">2 Chr. 24: 4</note> neede go no farther to gather, that there was a time, and the same a longer time to than was meete, before that he, though not Idolatrous, but in his measure well gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, did occupy his head with that businesse. Whereby also it may well bee, that whereas it is noted, that the <hi>Leuites</hi> made no hast therein (the Priestes also beeing some part of them) they were not altogether so much in fault, as some do account <note place="margin">Ibid. 5. &amp; 2 King. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

The course that hee tooke when now himselfe did set in hand with it, was in effect but the same that he prescribed to them before: but in his hands it proceeded much better, than it did or could do in theirs. It was in effect but the same, because it was still to come out of the Purses of the people. But it seemeth, that now there was speciall and extraordinary cause <note place="margin">2 Chr. 14: 6, 9</note> so to do: and therefore that <hi>Ioas</hi> being more willing than able to take that work in hand, leaned now to that helpe that God directed <hi>Moses</hi> vnto, when the Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle was to be erected.

The ill token that wee haue of it, is that the King did not take away the <note place="margin">2 King. 12: 3</note> High-places (when he was at the best) but suffered the people to offer and burne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense there. Comming to the proofe of the thing it selfe, we finde that he kept his standing very ill: but that God did accordingly remember him for it. Wee finde that he kept his standing ill, hee and all the people with him, immediately after the death of <hi>Iehoiada:</hi> and yet not so very soone after, but that for a while it seemeth they stoode reasonable well; but then, that not long after they fouly fell. It seemeth that a while after they stoode reasonable well, because that when <hi>Iehoiada</hi> was dead, they affoorded to bury him so honourably as they did, in the Citty of <hi>Dauid</hi> with the <note place="margin">2 Chr. 24: 15, 16.</note> Kings: as hauing iustly deserued the same, for the good that hee had done among them. Where againe we haue another probability, that there was not such fault in him, as some of our Interpreters doe conceiue, out of the speach of the King to him <note place="margin">2 King. 12: 17</note> and others of his fellowes, about the not gathering of the Money aforesaid. That neuerthelesse not long after they fouly fell, is very plainly deliuered vnto vs: and first by what meanes it was wrought; then, how fouly it was that they fell. The meanes whereby it was wrought, was by such dealing as the Princes had with the King, which what it was, is not so plainely set downe, but that diuers doe diuersly take it: some, that they attributed Diuine honour vnto him, and so puft him vp thereby, that hee
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:7530:238"/> quickly forgot himselfe so farre as hee did; but most men inclining rather, that they <note place="margin">Con. Pellic. Fran. Vatab. Tremel. Iun. Bibl.

But neither of these seeme vnto mee to goe rightly and fully vnto it; for that either of those had disswaded him from all Religion: whereas the Text it selfe sheweth immediately af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <note place="margin">2 Chr. 24: 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </note> that hee and the people were religious in some kinde; but indeede in another kind than before, and the same starke naught. So it seemeth rather, that these Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces were meere polititians, and accounted it to make much for the quiet and peace of the State, and for better friendship of all their neighbours, not to be so cleane con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to all others in matters of Religion, as they were in the course that then they were in: but rather that somewhat they yeelded vnto them, to bee neighbour-like with them; and that the neerer they could come to be like to the rest, the better must it bee for them all, in all such matters as wherein they were to haue any dealing with others. It is plainely set down that the King yeelded therein to be aduised by them: <note place="margin">Ibid. 17. Ibid. 18.</note> and it followeth immediately after, that they left their owne Religion or manner of worshipping, &amp; betooke themselues to such Religion or manner of worshipping, as their neighbours about them vsed. So, the latter, expoundeth the former: or, that which thereupon they did, doth shew what aduise it was that was giuen. How fou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they fell heerein appeareth first, in that whereunto they had now betaken them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues: then, in that they claue vnto it so fast as they did. That whereunto they had now betaken themselues, was, cleane to forsake true Religion; and, in effect, GOD himselfe, the onely Lord: and to betake themselues to most foolish and grose Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry; sauing onely that it went for currant with all their neighbours, because of the ignorance that was in them. When we are to consider how fast they claue to these their waies now, it shall not be amisse, that some of vs especially doe marke another thing thereunto appertaining: but first, how fast they claue to those waies of theirs; then, of that other matter heereunto appertaining. They claue so fast to those waies <note place="margin">2 Chro. 24: 19-22.</note> of theirs, that though the Lord sent Prophets among them, who did earnestly call vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, and protested heauy iudgements against them vnlesse they repented; and, that one of those Prophets was <hi>Zachariah,</hi> the sonne of <hi>Iehoiadah,</hi> who had deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued so well of the King, and of the people, and was neere Kinsman vnto the King: yet would they in no wise be ruled by those their Prophets; but farther than so, euen conspired against the said <hi>Zachariah,</hi> and at the commandement of the King stoned him to death, euen in the in most and chiefest coutt of the Temple, betweene the Temple and the Altar euen as it were in the praesence of God and before his face.

There hee telleth vs, that there bee two sorts of Protestants: one, but simple: the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, malicious.

They agree in this, that the <hi>Syrians</hi> soone after came into the lande, and made warre vppon them: but then, are they diuers in this againe, that by the one place it seemeth, the enemy was pacified with mony, and so sent home without do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> them any hurt; by the other, that a battell was fought betwixt them, and <note place="margin">

Amazias</hi> succeeded his Father <hi>Ioas;</hi> and raigned nyne and twenty yeares in <hi>Ierusalem:</hi> first reasonably wel; but afterward to the offence and displeasure of God. While he raigned reasonably well, we are to consider, <note place="margin">2 King. 14: 1. 2 2 Chr. 25: 1.</note> first, what was the manner of his Gouernement: then, howe it pleased GOD
<pb facs="tcp:7530:239"/> to blesse him therein. In his manner of gouernment, first wee haue something noted vnto vs that concerneth the whole generally: then, certaine particulars <note place="margin">2 King. 14: 3, 4 2 Chro. 25: 2</note> besides. Concerning his whole gouernment generally (for the time that he stood) hee hath this commendation giuen him, that hee did vprightly in the sight of the Lord: but then it is added withall, that his doings were not with a perfect heart, like vnto <hi>Dauid,</hi> but like vnto <hi>Ioas</hi> his Father; and that the High-places were not taken away, but that the people did sacrifice &amp; burnt incense in them. The particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars which are commendable in him are two: one, a good moderation of his owne affections; the other, a good branch of obedience to God. That good modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his owne affections, was in the execution of those that slew his Father: first, in that he was not so hasty to doe it, or to make enquiry of them, till the Kingdome <note place="margin">2 King. 14: 5, 6 2 Chr. 25: 3, 4.</note> was established vnto him; then, that he executed but the offenders themselues, and not their children withall, as it was the manner of diuers then in their heate to do, though plainely forbidden by the Lawe of God. That good branch of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence <note place="margin">Deut. 24: 16</note> to God, that is recorded of him, is, that when on a time hee was purposed to Warre vpon the <hi>Edomites,</hi> and to that ende had waged out of <hi>Israell</hi> one hundred <note place="margin">2 Chr. 25: 6-10</note> thousand men, and had already giuen them their pay, one hundred Talents of Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer; beeing then admonished by some Prophet or man of God, not to vse them in that his seruice but to send them away againe: he readily yeelded to do as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet did aduise him, and so discharged them of that peece of seruice, and dismissed them cleane out of his Army. A speciall good example of obedience in him; and the more we marke it, the better it may appeare vnto vs: first, if wee marke how farre he had proceeded in it before; then, if we thereunto lay, in what sort he was disswaded from it now. He had proceeded therein so farre before, that then hee must cleane leese those hundred Talants of Siluer, and the hope of that their seruice <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> which by likelihood might haue beene to good vse vnto him: and so dismissing them when now they were come, might easily breede much heart-burning in them, and so turne to his hurt, as in the end indeede it did: He was not disswaded from <note place="margin">Ibid. 13.</note> it by any of his Counsell, or of his Captaines, nor by any States-men besides; yet this being a matter of warfare and State: but onely by a Prophet or man of God, as by some Diuine, Minister, or Preacher with vs, of vndoubted and knowne inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity and iudgement; and the same Prophet or man of God disswading him from it, not, in plaine tearmes, in the name of the Lord, but, as it were, himselfe so adui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing him, &amp; threatning the losse of the field if he did not obey. Out of which it may seeme that wee ought to gather, that euen in such matters also wee ought to make speciall good reckoning of the aduise of such of the Ministery as are knowne to bee of God indeede; though they doe not acquaint vs with, nor our selues see, what word of God it is whereon they ground their aduise vnto vs: then also, that seeing God by his seruant reprooued that his taking-in of those <hi>Israelites</hi> to his ayd, and though being admonished hee did amend it; neither should we leane to any such aid, neither should we thinke it strange to be chasticed for it, if at any time we haue so done, though afterward we did forethinke it. It pleased God so to blesse him whilest thus hee stoode towardes God, that notwithstanding those inuasions, and destruction of the people that were since the daies of <hi>Iehoshaphat,</hi> in the daies of <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horam, Ahaziah, Athalia</hi> and <hi>Ioash,</hi> hee had an Army of his owne people now, of <note place="margin">Ibid. 5. 11, 12 2 King. 14: 7</note> three hundred thousand chosen men for the warres: and, going against the <hi>Edo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites,</hi> he so preuailed against them, that hee destroyed twenty thousand of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, and tooke a strong hold from them besides. When his raigne and doings were to the offense and displeasure of God, we are then in like sort to consider, first what those his waies were: then, how God did punnish him for them. His waies were now cleane contrary to his better waies before, aduancing one kind of grosse Idolatry now: and not abiding the Prophet to reprooue it neither. His Idolatry was, that hauing ouercome the <hi>Edomites,</hi> hee brought home their Gods with him, <note place="margin">2 Chr. 25: 14</note> and made them his (a wise part of him) worshipping them, and burning incense vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them. When thereupon God sent a Prophet to reprooue him for it, hee was so offended with him, that hee commaunded him to silence, and vrged him to aduise <note place="margin">Ibid: 15, 16</note>
               <pb n="455" facs="tcp:7530:239"/> himselfe whether hee were any of the Kings Priuy Counsell; so insinuating, it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, that there was some high poynt of policie in it: but the Prophet told him, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> notwithstanding all his policie, that hee did well know, that it should bee his vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ruine, and that from the Lord, that now hee made so little reckoning of this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe that hee had giuen him. His punnishment for this is his falling away, was of such nature, as that it seemeth God was disposed to rayse it onely from thence, from whence the same his reuolting came, euen from himselfe: first by the <hi>Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi> his neighbours adioyning; then, by his owne people at home. The <hi>Israelites,</hi> his neighbors adioyning, himselfe (and by the aduise of his Counsell too; such be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like <note place="margin">2 King. 14: 8-<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> in steede of his Father, and raigned fifty and two yeares. Concerning whome, first wee are to consider of that part of his gouernment, which was (that wee read of) without offence to GOD: then, of that part wherein hee offended. Of that part of his gouernment that was (for any thing that wee read to the contrary) without offence to GOD, wee haue something noted againe, first to shewe what the thing it selfe was: then, howe God did blesse him therein. To finde what it selfe was, wee must note againe, that both wee haue somewhat set downe concerning the whole: and some particulers likewise besides. That which doeth concerne the whole, is, that hee did vprightly in the sight of the Lord: sauing that <note place="margin">2 King. 15▪ 3, 4 2 Chr. 26: 4.</note> it was but as <hi>Amaziah</hi> his Father had done before; and so, that hee also did not put downe the High-places, but that the people still Sacrificed and burnt incense there in his time also. So that the vprightnesse of his doing that is spoken of here, is none other to speake of, than as in his father before, and his sonne after, that hee turned not to Idolatrie as many others had done, but professed the Lord, and the true worship of him. Those particulers that are noted of him besides, are of two sorts: one of them, of his regard towardes God; others, of inferiour affaires be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> His regard to God is noted to be such, as that in the dayes of one <hi>Zechari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Chr. 26: 5</note> a Prophet in his time (a man noted to be well seene in the knowleege and feare of God, and sincerely, it seemeth, teaching the same) he then more specially sought the Lord. And so it seemeth the fault is oftimes in the Prophets &amp; Ministers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, that many do not better seek the Lord: as seldome hauing any good prouo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation thereto, in those that occupie those roomes among them. Those others that were of inferior affaires beneath, were of two sortes also: some, about the whole e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state; others about his owne priuate. About the whole estate were those his buildinges, fortifications, and prouisions against the time of Warre that wee reade <note place="margin">Ibi. 2, 9, 14, 15</note> of: and it seemeth, that therein hee much excelled most of those that had beene before him. About his owne priuate it is noted likewise, that hee was very <note place="margin">Ibid. 10.</note> much imployed: and that hee was (as wee tearme it) a great Husband: hee himselfe hauing a speciall inclination or loue vnto it. While in this sort hee <note place="margin">Ibid. 5, 10-13</note> gouerned, GOD did so prosper him, and his blessing was so plentifully on him (especially then, when in some better measure he sought the Lord) that he was very prosperous at home and abroad. At home hee had, for the defence of the whole, an army of three hundred and seauen thousand, and fiue hundered valiant men; and two thousand and sixe hundred Leaders or Captaines for them: and of his owne priuate, great possessions in groundes and Cattle. Abroad, it is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:7530:240"/> saide, for all the peoples round about him, that his name was great, or that it <note place="margin">Ibid. 6-8, 15</note> did spread farre: and, for certaine of them, more specially, that he did most valiantly against his Enemies, and mightily praeuailed both against the <hi>Philistims</hi> and <hi>Arabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans;</hi> and of the <hi>Ammonites,</hi> that he was much honoured and praesented with guiftes by them. When hee offended, wee are likewise to consider, first of his offence: then, of his punishment. His offence was not Idolatry as his Fathers was, nor so much as offering vnto GOD any such worshippe as God himselfe did not require: but onely that himselfe would needes doe a worshippe to God, which God had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed <note place="margin">Ibid. 16-19</note> to bee done by others; namely, to burne Incense or sweete Perfume, on the Altar that was thereunto appointed. Of which his sinne there were two principall braunches: one, that himselfe did first offer to doe it; the other, that he would be so little saide by the Priestes therein, that they were faine to oppose themselues against him in some forcible manner. That himselfe did first offer to doe it, it argueth in him, eyther great ignorance in the Law of God (and that was a great fault in him:) or else, that he was very head-strong and stubborne, and so not disposed to be ruled <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> thereby; which was the greater fault of the two. Now because it is so plainely no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that when hee was strong, or that God had made him great, his heart began to <note place="margin">Ibid. 16.</note> be lifted vp, that seemeth to cast it vnto the latter: as, that it was not of ignorance, but of wilfulnesse rather. But that relation or report of the highnesse of his mind there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, may haue respect vnto that his stubbornnesse, when hee had himselfe ignorantly attempted it first, and then would not afterward be ruled by the Priestes therein, till it pleased God himselfe to lay his hand vppon him. So his fault was great in eyher of them: but much greater in the latter part of it, when hee would not bee aduysed by the Priestes, those peculiar Seruantes of God in those affayres, and so many of them gathered together. His punnishment for this was, some part of it, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as it were of men: but the rest, plainely by God. That part of it which wee may account to bee of men, was, that so he was resisted or with-stood, he beeing so <note place="margin">Ibid. 17, 18</note> mighty and renowned a Prince, of a few of his owne seely poore subiectes: but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede we our selues doe stirre vp others against vs, whensoeuer wee go against the word of God; and may not thinke it strange then, if we be roundly with-stood, and mightily crossed, euen by the simplest Creatures that are. That which was of God, was a praesent punishment in it selfe: and carried another with it besides. It was in it selfe a praesent punnishment for that hee was, euen at that time, so strangely strucken <note place="margin">Ibid 19. 2 King. 15: 5</note> with so ill and so foule a disease, as the Leprosie was reputed and knowne to be. That other that it carryed with it besides, was, that thereby hee was separated from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong <note place="margin">2 Chr. 26 20-23.</note> men (and so from the managing of his Kingdome likewise, and of his owne priuate affaires withall, for a great part of them and faine to dwell alone all the dayes of his life after: and that when hee died, hee was not vouchsafed so honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable buryall neither, as otherwise his place had required. A good example to be a warning to all to take heede, of diuers speciall matters: some reasonable plaine vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all; others, that would not be soone perceiued. Those that are reasonable plain vnto all, are, first that none meddle with the office of Priest-hoode (and so not with the Mynistery now) but such as are orderly called vnto it; and therein are Lay-folke to take heede how they meddle with priuate Baptisme: the other, that wee bee not so resolute in our owne waies, when wee are reprooued by such, as God hath to that end appointed. Those that would not be so soone perceiued, are other two: one, that whereas that Priest-hood was a figure of Christ by whom onely wee are to come with our worship to God, neyther may we come by our selues, nor by any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> but onely by him; the other, that whereas the Priests did not shew him the place of the Law where it was forbidden, but onely told him that he might not doe it, and yet God strucke him for that he would not be ruled by them, neyther may we looke to stand excused in any such disobedience of ours, to any the like Seruants of God, though they doe not euer acquaint vs with the places whereon they ground the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe that they giue vs.</p>

In whom we haue some thinges of that nature, that they doe reasonable plainely shew themselues what they are: others, that do not. Those that doe reasonable plainely shew themselues what they are, are some of them commendable: others, reprooueable. In those that are commendable, it shall be good for vs to consider, first what they were: then, how in those waies God did prosper him. Commendable it was, that he did vprightly in the <note place="margin">2 King. 15: 34. 35. 2 Chr. 27: 2, 3, 6. 2 Chr. 27: 5, 6</note> sight of the Lorde (though that also were but in comparison of diuers others:) and built both the highest gate of the house of the Lorde; and a good part of the Wall West of the Temple. In those waies of his God did so prosper him, that he praeuai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led against the <hi>Ammonites,</hi> and had them tributaries three yeares: and generally, that he grew mighty, because he directed his way before the Lord his God. A place ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthelesse that more commendeth the goodnesse of God, that coulde so graciously accept of that his seruice: than it cleereth that seruice to bee so woorthy to bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted; as may appeare by that which followeth. In those that were reprooueable we are likewise to consider, first what they were: then, how wee may conceiue that they also were punished. What they were might soone be seene, but that, as some of them are out of quaestion: so there is one, of which there is quaestion made by diuers. Those that are out of quaestion, are two: one, that hee did not seeke the Lord, but as <note place="margin">2 King 15: 34 35. 2 Chr. 27: 2.</note> his Father had done before: the other, that he left the High-places standing, and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered the people to worship there. That one point of his waies, whereof there is quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion made by diuers, is, that he entered not into the Temple: which as diuers do take it, is noted as a thing commendable in him; whereas, by the placing of it, it may seeme to be reprooueable, and so do I thinke it may rather bee taken. Such as ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it commendable in him, do take the sense to be, that although in profession, or <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Lyr. in</hi> 4. <hi>Reg.</hi> 15. <hi>i, k. Bibl.

And out of this, the sense beeing so, it is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> well gathered, that therein he is a good patterne to vs, so to follow the good wayes of our Elders, that neuerthelesse we do not withall follow their ill. The placing of it that I speake of, which may rather lead vs to conceiue, that it noteth some-thing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proueable in him, is because it is placed with such aqualification before: and after a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, so matched or coupled, as there it is. The qualification where-with it is pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced before, is the manner of his Fathers profession: wherein the sense may bee, that hee also was none of those that turned a-side to any Idols, but professed the Lord the onely true God, and did worshippe none other but him; but yet did not make vse of the Temple, or frequent the same, in any such sort as he ought to haue done, and as his Father (besides that his transgression) before had doone. And in this wee may well conceiue, that this exception, of not entering into the Temple, may rather haue relation vnto the vsuall course of all the better sort generally, and of his owne Father too in that which was commendable in him, than to that one parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular action, neuer heard of in any of the Kinges but onely in him, and that but once neyther. In such matching or coupling of it as after wee finde, it is very plaine and out of quaestion, that it is coupled with that which is ill: namely, that the people were yet far out of order. And then, seeing things of like nature are so commonly cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled together, that by the one we may soone perceiue what the other is like to bee; it seemeth the sense doth most naturally fall out to note, that there were defects both in the King, and in the people: in the King, that euen in his best things he was but like vnto his Father in those thinges that were commendable in him, and had one defect more that his Father had not; and that the people were wrong besides. What his not entering into the Temple may be, me-thinke wee may well conceiue, by that which followed on that fearefull iudgement that was cast on <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sapphira</hi> his wife, <note place="margin">Act. 5: 1-13</note> for that want of integrity and sincere dealing, that was found in them: namely, that it strucke such a feare in others, that there were many that magnyfied those that were of the Congregation, or that holy company, who neuerthelesse durst not ioine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:7530:241"/> unto them. For so it may be, that <hi>Iotham</hi> was so terrified by that iudgement cast on his Father, that though hee also magnified God, yea and iustified his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments therein: yet himselfe durst not thenceforward draw so neere, least that some way or other hee also might slip, and so pull downe some kinde of heauy iudgement <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> vpon him. Our own experience doth often teach vs, euen in those that detest Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, and are specially giuen to the Gospell, that neuerthelesse diuers of them doe long sometimes absent themselues from the holy Communion, euen for the very aw of God that they stand in, least they offend in not comming so well prepared as they ought to doe: and then may we more easily conceiue, that such a iudgement cast on his Father, and when he had no other meaning that we are able to charge him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, but onely that he meant deuoutly to worship, might not a little terrifie the Sonne in this that we speake off; and yet leaue vnto him withall, that so farre as it went, hee had a speciall regard of God, in some such measure as both his Father and Grand-Father had, and came not short of them but in this point onely. And one there is, <note place="margin">

And then, if it were so common with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers euen good Kings too, elsewhere to worship: it may bee lesse maruell, if this (much more) refused the Temple it selfe, &amp; elsewhere did it; and yet haue that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation too, neuer worshipping but only the Lord, and doing it with some speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al zeale. How these defects in him were punished, is likewise drawn into quaestion: so that here also it shalbe needful not only to set downe what may seem to be the truth it selfe; but to cleere it of the doubt thereon conceiued. That which wee may take to bee the truth it selfe, is, that the end of his raigne was troublesome, because it is <note place="margin">2 King. 15: 37</note> sayde, that in those daies the Lord began to send in against <hi>Iudah</hi> both the King of <hi>Syria,</hi> and the King of <hi>Israell.</hi> Of whom though we haue no particular Story, what hurt they did or what trouble they wrought to the King or his Land: yet may wee iustly conceiue, that the Lord sending them in, and sending them against <hi>Iudah,</hi> or as enemies thereunto, they did them some hurt or wrought, them some trouble one way or other; though nothing so much, as after they did, in the daies of him that next succeeded. The doubt that is thereon conceiued, is not plainely set downe, but onely implyed: namely, that no such trouble came vnto himselfe or his Land, in all his time. And it seemeth that so they conceiue, first by one place of Scripture <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> soone after ensuing: then, by a conceiued opinion of others. The place of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture soone after ensuing, is, that they both came into <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and besiedged it; but yet that they could not praeuaile against it: neuerthelesse, that then they recoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <note place="margin">2 Kin. 16: 5, 6</note>
               <hi>Elah</hi> againe, which <hi>Vzziah</hi> had gotten from them a little before. Out of this <note place="margin">Ibid. 14: 22</note> place they gather, that seeing this is the first enterance of the <hi>Syrians</hi> &amp; <hi>Israelites</hi> that now we reade of in particular: therefore is that other place before to be vnderstood <note place="margin">Lyr. Io. wolph. Bibl. Angl.</note> of this that is spoken off now; and so, nothing appertaining to the time of <hi>Iotham,</hi> but onely to the time of <hi>Ahaz</hi> his Sonne. But the Text doth plainely, in the time and Story of <hi>Iotham,</hi> say, that in those daies the Lord began to send those in: and, in the daies of <hi>Ahaz</hi> next following, that they came vp to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and besiedged it. A difference so plaine in it selfe, that it may bee sufficient to note two seuerall inuasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; though we haue not the particular Story of the former of them: and so is it ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken <note place="margin">Con. Pellic. Tremel. Iun.</note> by others also. That conceiued opinion of others is, that this <hi>Iotham</hi> that now we speake off, was so good a King, and altogether (as it were) without such faults as others had: an opinion much conceiued by <hi>Iosephus,</hi> and plainely held by most of the <hi>Hebrewes;</hi> and yet without any sufficient ground-worke for so weighty a building as <note place="margin">

But that being once conceiued, then is it so much the harder measure to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue any such speciall defects in him: and so it may very well be, that thereupon they rather framed this aforesaid interpretation of theirs.

               </note> of <hi>Iotham:</hi> who succeeding his Father in the kingdome, sixteene yeares also he raig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned therein, like to his Father in nothing else but onely in that. For though his Father was none of the best (though I deny not, but that others there be, that make speciall reckoning of him for that matter: and my-selfe desire not to impaire any part of his glory; but yet must still say, that I see no cause to varry) nor <hi>Vzziah</hi> the Father of <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tham,</hi> nor <hi>Amaziah</hi> his Grand-father neither: yet this on the other side was so very ill, that it seemeth he inhaerited no part of the good that any of them had, but that all their euill (and much more) was descended vnto him, and that hee was (as it were) their heire only in that. So that in his Story it seemeth to me, it is not sufficient, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider onely of himselfe; but to haue some reference to those others his ancesters be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides: and that, both in the euill waies that he held; and in those punishments which befell him from the same. As touching those ill waies that he held, we haue the same deliuered vnto vs, by one kinde of speach that is (as it seemeth to mee) some-what strange: but the others are vsuall, and plaine enough in themselues. That which see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to me somewhat strange, is notwithstanding (I readily grant) to good purpose vsed, and of speciall good instruction as it may bee taken: and yet notwithstanding eyther cleane omitted by others; or not sufficiently considered vpon, as I doe take it. The speach is, that whereas this <hi>Ahaz</hi> was a very bad one (if not the worst of all the Kinges of <hi>Iudah</hi> that were before him) yet, at the first the Text dooth seeme but to mince at the matter (as me do tearme it) and nothing neere to note, that which was in him indeed. For at the first he telleth vs no more, but that hee did not vprightly in the sight of the Lord, like <hi>Dauid</hi> his Father: and in both places the selfe-same speach <note place="margin">2 King. 16: 2 2 Chr 28: 1</note> is praecisely vsed. Which kind of speach, we might thinke, were not properly to be v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, but onely of such as haue done reasonably well, and yet not like to <hi>Dauid</hi> before. So the strangnes is, that whereas indeed <hi>Ahaz</hi> was a very bad one, &amp; so described by and by after: yet at the first the Text seemeth to stand so far of from him, as though it meant not to touch him any thing neere, to speake of; or, that with any thing almost he were to be iustly touched. Of <hi>Amaziah</hi> it granteth before, that he did not like to <note place="margin">2 King. 14: 3 2 C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

But some there bee that do note it: one, that doth but onely note it, but that he doth in both places of it; and one other, that doth not onely note it, but withall considereth vppon it. For him that doth but onely note it, it seemeth he thought that there was some speciall matter <note place="margin">Conr. Pellic.</note> in it, though belike he did distrust, that he did not conceiue it: but that might giue oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion to others to think farther of it; especially seeing so praecisely he doth it, in both places of it. That which the other gathereth thereon, is, that thereby is generally no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, <note place="margin">Ioā. wolphius.</note> that hee did nothing right before God; as if whereas it is saide, that hee did not
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:7530:242"/> vprightly in the fight of the Lord, this difference of speach (to be saide of him, that he did not vprightly; of other ill Kinges, that they did ill) should haue this meaning, that whereas they were not charged but to haue done diuers thinges ill, this heereby is charged that he did nothing well. This doe I take to bee some-thing forced: though otherwise he be a very learned and diligent Interpreter, and right worthy to follow him that he dooth, to finish that, which the other, praeuented with death, was not able to reach vnto. Another sense there is, which, I graunt, is (as it were) some-what far fetcht: and yet so agreeable to other Scriptures, as that it is not amisse to thinke of it also. Some-what far fetcht we may account it to be, for that taking it so, the meaning should be, that euen in this place, where it may seem that the spirit of God meaneth no more, but to set downe the Story of <hi>Ahaz:</hi> yet would he giue vnto vs, in his example, a generall rule of a speciall good point of doctrine for all, &amp; for all ages ensuing: namely, that whosoeuer they are that goe but negligently to worke, and doe not endeuour to bee with the best: those by the iust iudgements of God, may very well be, euen of the worst; and so euer are, but so farre as it pleaseth God to stay them, that thinges be not among vs too too farre out of order. And so the meaning to bee, that seeing <hi>Ahaz</hi> did not regard to walke vprightly before the Lord, as <hi>Dauid</hi> before had doone, therefore may no man thinke it strange, nor im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent to the course wherein he was, if then he should quickly become the worst man liuing: and so, this to be noted (as it were) the Fountaine, out of which the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> (euen all that naughtinesse of his whatsoeuer) did proceede, and so might right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and kindly doe, though it had beene a thousand times more than it was. For the wordes if wee marke them, deliuer vnto vs two principall pointes: one, in plaine tearmes; the other likewise, if not necessarily, yet very probably implyed. In plain tearmes it telleth vs, what wayes he held: such as wherein he did not vprightly in the eyes of the Lord, as his Father <hi>Dauid</hi> before had doone. It implyeth, euen heere, not going any farther, very probably, that hee had no care neyther, so to doe: and whatsoeuer wanteth of the certainety of it here, that is fully supplyed by that which followeth, because he imployed himselfe so ill. For a man might haue a will to doe well; and yet by infirmity faile very much in doing of it: but to be altogether occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyed in so bad and base workes, as the Text immediatly after declareth he was, doth necessarily import, that he had no due regard vnto the other; namely, to do vpright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the fight of the Lord, as did his Father <hi>Dauid</hi> before. Those other Scriptures whereunto it agreeth, are many: but some may serue to make demonstration of it. To the breach of the Sabbaoth it is knowne well enough, that the Lord appointed death, euen when hee required that free-will offering towardes the building of the Tabernacle; and when the Worke-men were to set in hand with their working on it, <note place="margin">Exo. 31: 12-17 Ibid. 35: 1-3 Nū. 15: 32-36</note> (Church-worke as plaine, as possibly may be:) as also that once he caused execution to be done on one who gathered stickes thereon. In which whosoeuer can marke, that the breach of the Sabbaoth commeth of vngodlinesse, and that wheresoeuer vngodlinesse lodgeth, there is all vngodlinesse besides, but so farre as it pleaseth God specially to stay, he can easily see good Co-haerence in that iudgement of God there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and can more readily yeelde his heart vnto the full iustifying of it: as a iudgment but very easie for all such parties, as in whom it is certaine, that there is lodged so great iniquity. In the first Psalme likewise the Prophet setting downe certaine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees <note place="margin">Psal. 1: 1.</note> in finning, doth immediatly after the vngodly person set downe the Sinner: to giue vs to vnderstand, that no man can be vngodly or godlesse, but one way or other, hee must bee some detestable Sinner withall. The Apostle in his Epistle to the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes,</hi> willeth vs to leaue now the principles of Religion, which hee calleth the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine <note place="margin">Heb. 6: 1-6</note> of the beginning of Christ, and to be led to farther perfection; and his reason is, that if we fall away, then are we in pittiful &amp; hard estate: so teaching vs to gather, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> that if wee doe not still endeauour our selues to goe on to farther perfection, then are we in praesent danger to fall away also. The like vnto which he hath else-where besides soone after following, eyther to draw neere with assurance of Fayth in the <note place="margin">Ibid. 10: 22-26</note> time of grace, or else to bee in speciall great danger, of giuing ouer the whole pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, and to returne to our vomit againe.

So God telling vs in the Story of <hi>Ahaz,</hi> that he had no regard of doing vprightly in the fight of GOD, as <hi>Dauid</hi> his Father before had done (as his owne doinges sufficiently declared) may very well meane, to teach vs thereby to gather, that thence it proceeded, that he became so bad as he was.

Such is the case that nowe we speake of: euer hauing mighty force against vs, in all good proceedinges what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer (the sway or vsuall course of the World, and the temptation of Sathan with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out; the corruption also of our owne Nature within:) so that if we doe not earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly labour, in the best manner we can, to goe forward; then fall wee backe-ward still more and more, but so farre as it pleaseth God to stay vs. Those other speaches, whereby the ill wayes of <hi>Ahaz</hi> are deliuered vnto vs, and which speaches are vsuall and plaine, doe note vnto vs diuers sortes of ill wayes in him: some, that seeme to be referred to all his raigne generally; others, that arose but at some time onely, and vppon some speciall occasion. Those that seeme to bee referred to all his raigne ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally, doe witnesse indeede, that hee was exceeding wrong: and leaue vs thus much withall, that neuerthelesse he was very deuout and zealous in his kinde. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding wrong hee was both in the wayes of Israell, and in Heathenish Idolatry besides. The wayes of Israell were, the seruice of those golden Calues: ascribed especially to the Kinges of Israell, for that they were the deuisers and maintainers of <note place="margin">2 King. 16: 3 2 Chr. 28: 2</note> them, as the onely vpholders of that Kingdome of theirs. And because the vse of those Calues was to maintaine that state of theirs in their Apostacy or falling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from the Tribe of Iudah and Line of <hi>Dauid:</hi> therefore was <hi>Ahaz</hi> the King of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Iudah so much the more to blame for worshipping them, not onely because that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so was abhominable Idolatry; but withall, because they were so directly contrary to his owne State, and so strongly with-helde the greatest part of his Kingdome and people from him. In his Heathenish Idolatry hee both passed all others that were before him: and yet would haue the vse of theirs also. Hee passed all others that <note place="margin">2 King 26: 3 2 Chr. 28: 3</note> were before him, in that he spared not his owne Children, but did such worship to Idols by them, as Heathenish Idolaters vsed some-times to do. That Hearthenish Idolatry that some of his Fathers had vsed before, and whereof himselfe would haue the vse now, was the worshipping of <hi>Baalim:</hi> and that hee offered sacrifice and <note place="margin">2 King. 16: 4 2. Chr. 28: 2, 4</note> burnt Incense in the High-places, on the hils, and vnder euery greene Tree. That he was very deuout and zealous in his kinde, there can bee at all no quaestion of it; these thinges doe so plainely and fully witnesse the same: but it is good that wee doe marke it, that so wee may the better perceiue, that in the most corrupt Religion that is, there may be a very deuout and earnest zeale; and therefore that no body rest in his zeale, vnlesse he know the same to be right. Those other bad waies of his that arose but at some time onely, and vppon some speciall occasion, were certaine offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces or slips that hee made: one of them, when trouble began to grow against him; others, when he had safely passed a good part of that danger. The slip that hee made when trouble began to grow against him, was in a bad refusing of speciall good sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour offered vnto him: and a base betaking himselfe vnto an earthly fuccour rather. In which his refusing of that fauour offered, wee are first to consider what it was: then, whereuppon it may seeme, that it was so offered vnto him. It was, that <note place="margin">Isa. 7: 2-12</note> when <hi>Ahaz</hi> vnderstood that the Kinges of <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Israell</hi> had ioyned together to come against him and his people, hee and his people beeing in great perplexity and seare thereuppon, the Lorde by his Seruant the Prophet <hi>Esay</hi> bad him bee of good comfort, assuring him that they should not in such sort praeuaile against him: and, for his farther assurance therein, willed him not to spare but aske a signe of the Lorde, whatsoeuer hee woulde, eyther in the depth beneath, or in the heigth
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:7530:243"/> aboue. But <hi>Ahaz</hi> being so bad a man as he was, it seemeth strange, that GOD should haue such dealing with him by his seruant the Prophet: and not rather to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooue him sharply for that his great Idolatry; and for it to denounce heauy iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments against him. Neyther is it vnlikely, but that the Prophet had such dealing with him also. But those two Kings were purposed, to depose <hi>Ahaz,</hi> or cleane to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> destroy him, and to set vp another in his roome: a purpose directly against the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance <note place="margin">Ibid. 6.</note> of God, hauing before giuen that Kingdome to the line or posterity of <hi>Dauid.</hi> So it seemeth, that God in that respect, would defend him against them: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon vse this gracious dealing towardes him, by faire meanes the rather to win him vnto some better waies. How beit <hi>Ahaz</hi> had brought himselfe so farre in bondage to his owne bad nature, that he would looke for no such goodnesse at the handes of God, and so withall vtterly refused that gracious offer. That earthly succour where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto he did rather betake himselfe, and that basely enough too, was to seeke helpe of <note place="margin">2 Kin. 16: 7. 8 2 Chr. 28: 16 21.</note> the King of <hi>Assyria,</hi> now growing vp to some speciall greatnesse: and, to speede the better at his hands, he both abased himselfe so farre, as to tearme himselfe to bee his seruant, and his Son; an I withall sent him such a praesent, so hardly gotten together, as bewraied himselfe to be too too fearefull of them, euen in seruile and abiect man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. He safely passed a good part of that danger, when the King of <hi>Assyria</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly came, tooke <hi>Damascus,</hi> the head-Citty of <hi>Syria,</hi> and slew the King: for by <note place="margin">2 King. 16. 9 2 Chr. 28: 20</note> this, the King was deliuered from one great part of his feare. At which time againe we find, that he fouly slipped: first but onely in the fashion of an Altar; but then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise, a great deale more grosly. When it was but in the fashion of an Altar, yet euen that also was grose enough, both in being so new-fangled, that hee must haue <note place="margin">2 King. 16: 10-14</note> such an one in the house of the Lord at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> as hee had seene at <hi>Damascus</hi> an Idolatrous Citty: and in placing it so as hee did when once he had gotten it ready; wherein also it is not amisse to note, that the High-Priest then, was as ready to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide it, as he to require it. Like lips, like Lettice. When otherwise hee offended more grosly, wee haue it noted vnto vs, first in respect of the time when so hee did: then, in respect of that which he did therein. The time is noted to be, when he was <note place="margin">2 Chr. 28: 22</note> in tribulation: so hardly are wee any thing mended thereby, vnlesse it please God to vouchsafe vs that mercy. That which then hee did, was first concerning some in particular: then, certaine others at large. Those that his doing concerned in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular were the Gods of <hi>Damascus:</hi> and the Lord himselfe. The Gods of <hi>Damas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,</hi> those foolish and absurd Idols, neuerthelesse found such fauour with him, that <note place="margin">Ibid. 23.</note> now he became a worshipper of them; yea notwithstanding that they (as hee tooke it) had plagued him: and his reason was, for that they (as he would needes bee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded of them) had so well holpen that people against him (not considering that it was the Lord, who for his Idolatry sent them in vpon him, and gaue them power against him) they would no doubt helpe him likewise, if hee were a worshipper of them. But as for the Lord, hee found so little fauour with him, that diuers thinges that appertained to the House of the Lord, and to his worship there, he did alter and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> deface at his pleasure: in one speciall thing, hauing the High Priest aforesayde con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring with him; doing the others but himselfe alone. He had the High-Priest con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring with him, both in taking-in this new Altar, for the vse of it, into the place of the former: and, in abasing the other. Into the place of the former this new Altar was taken for that the King commanded all those thinges to be done thereon, which <note place="margin">2 King. 16: 15. 16.</note> God had before appointed to be done on the other: and <hi>Vriah</hi> the Priest did accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to all that hee commanded. The other was abased, not onely in that the new was taken in neerer to the Sanctuary it selfe, and was withall bereaued of those ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uices <note place="margin">Ibid. 16. Ibid. 17. 18 2 Chr. 28: 24. 29. 3, 7.</note> which God allotted vnto it: but also in that it must be reserued, for the King (forsooth) for him thereby to inquire of God, wherein he would bee sure but little to trouble it. Those others that he did but by himselfe, were, first that hee did but deface, and vsed at his pleasure diuers thinges in the House of the Lord: and then, in the end, shut it vp cleane. So carefull was he to reserue that Altar onely to himselfe, thereby to inquire of the Lord: much like to our late <hi>Ahazes</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> who were so long fingering the holy Scriptures, to alter and change the ordinances thereof at
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:7530:243"/> their pleasure, that at the length when they could not make them sufficiently to square to their purpose, then did they take them (in a manner) cleane away from vs all, locking them vp in a strange tongue, and making bloody Lawes against the reading of them; and though they bare vs in hand, that them selues woulde en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of them, yet haue they made it plaine enough to the worlde, that they haue little enquired of the Lorde by them. The referrence that in these matters it is good that we haue to those other Ancestors of his (such I meane as went immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately next before him) is no more but this, that seeing they declined still so much as they did, not regarding to serue the Lord, but (as it were) in a secondary manner, therefore to them might it be in some measure imputed, that now they haue such a Successor following, as doth not so mince at the matter as they did, but ouerthrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all at once, and maketh at all no Conscience of it: as also there is no better to be expected of the great estates of this age also, but that if themselues haue but a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condary care in the aduancement of the kingdom of Christ, while they are in place to do it, they will quickely so breede others ensuing, that will make at all no recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of it. The punnishment that befell him for this, was most of it in his life: but some part of it also in his buriall when hee was dead. That which was cast vppon him in his life, was to be ouer-runne with his enemies: which for the most part wee haue set downe but generally; but some part of it, more specially also.

Those that hee had well waged to stand friendly vnto him (which was against the <hi>Syrians)</hi> are noted also, nothing at all to hane holpen him, but to haue troubled him: but it is not declared how. But meete it was, that he that was the professed seruaunt of God, and yet had broken with him so fowly now, should not finde such good dealing with men when he did neede it. That which is set downe more specially, is, how the <hi>Israelites</hi> preuay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led against him: in whom notwithstanding we haue a notable example of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence vnto the word of the Lord deliuered vnto them by one of his Prophets. In that the <hi>Israelites</hi> so preuailed against him, it is good first to note, how it may seeme that the encounter began betwixt them: then, what successe it was that the <hi>Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi> had therein. The encounter may seeme to beginne betwixt them, not til the King of <hi>Assyria</hi> had eased <hi>Ahaz</hi> the King of <hi>Iudah</hi> of one of his enemies the King of <hi>Syria:</hi> and that then, seeing the <hi>Israelites</hi> were come in against him, hee woulde needs giue them battell, whereas now it may be, that they could haue beene con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, quyetly to haue departed home againe, seeing they were disappointed so much as they were, of their confederates. It may so seeme, because this battail was on both sides foughten so sore as it was: the Iewes stāding to it, to so great a slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of them; and the <hi>Israelites</hi> making such hauocke of them, and taking away so many Prisoners with them besides. A thing that was likely enough not to haue beene, if the <hi>Israelites</hi> could quietly haue departed againe, as not beeing so able now to deale with their enemies: and yet notwithstanding, that their enemies, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting they had the aduantage of them, woulde not suffer them so to doo, but needs would take that aduantage of them. The successe that the <hi>Israelites</hi> had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Iewes</hi> heerein, was very great: slaying downe-<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

The example of their obedience vnto a Prophet of the Lordes was such, that although the Prophet did not tell them, that he came that message vnto them <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

That which befell him in his buriall when he was dead, was, that hee was not of his owne people vouchsafed that honour, as to bee <note place="margin">2 King. 16: 20 2 Chr. 28: 27</note> buried among the Kings: a right iudgement in it selfe; but so much the rather to be regarded, as at this time it might well proceede sincerely from them, without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny priuate respect at all. For there is no reason, that such as so little regarded the glory of God, should afterward haue that honour with men, which otherwise by their place had bin due vnto them: but rather, that all such should hold themselues fully contented, that while they liued, their people for feare did yeeld it vnto them; and withdrew it again so soone as they hoped that without any danger they might. The reference that in these his punnishments wee are to haue to those ancesters of his, is no more but this, that whosoeuer they are that do wish well to their line, or to their children or Issue ensuing, it were good for them, not to hold themselues contented with a secondary care of Religion or aduancing the glory of God, but to imploy themselues about those things euen in the best manner they can: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, that they are to make no quaestion, but that themselues do breede such a race, as, if they do not plucke on them some heauy iudgement, it is the speciall fauour of God that exempteth them from it, or otherwise reserueth them to endles torments against that great and fearefull day.</p>

Concerning whom, it is to be knowne, that he was a good one, and one of the best of them all: and yet that he was not without his infirmities neither. Considering of him as he was so good, we finde that he was (at the hands of God) accordingly blessed: and so are wee, first to consider of that his good seruice of God; then, how it pleased God to blesse <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> him for it. His good seruice to God wee haue first set downe but generally: but then, more specially. Generally it is said, that he did vprightly in the sight of the <note place="margin">2 King. 18: 3 2 Chr. 29: 2. 31: 20, 21. 2 King 18: 5 Ibid. 6.</note> Lord, according to all that <hi>Dauid</hi> his Father had done: his trust being such in the Lord, that neither after him nor before, there was any such among the Kings of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah;</hi> and cleauing so inseperably vnto him, that hee obserued those his Commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements, which he by <hi>Moses</hi> before had giuen. When the Story commeth to set downe the same more specially, it doth it in such sort, that as the Text a little before doth giue him commendation, that after him none was like him among al the Kings of <hi>Iudah,</hi> neyther that there were any such before him: so indeede may we see, that there was a maruelous excellent zeale in him, and such as was hardly out-matched by any. But for that kind of speech, because it is attributed to others also, as not onely to <hi>Salomon</hi> for his wisedome, and for the glory of his Kingdome, but also to <note place="margin">1 Kin. 3: 12, 13 2 Chr. 1▪ 12 2 King. 23: 25</note>
               <hi>Iosias</hi> for an excellent zeale that was in him likewise: it may seeme that it was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them vsed, as noting such as excelled in their kinde, and not so strictly as the very words themselues doe otherwise import; or that therein they had respect but onely to such, as within some vsuall or reasonable compasse of time (such as came within their memory or neere vnto it) either were in place before, or after succee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Kings that they speake off. It may be also, that as it is agreed of all, that in <hi>Salomon</hi> it pleased God, in diuers of his excellencies, to giue them a figure of their Messias that was to come: so, in those good Kinges that followed, hee would now and then renew it vnto them againe, so to keepe them still in some comfortable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of him, and not to suffer that so needfull an hope to be quenched among them. If so wee may take it, then in these also may we not looke onely to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, but vnto him whose figures they were, for the full accomplishment of those things that are there of them reported. And so is it maruelous true, euen in the vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termost
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:7530:244"/> reach of the wordes themselues, that euer none is like vnto him, before or after, nor any way comparable vnto the most absolute of all. And this do I think so much the more needfull to be marked here, for that most of our interpreters that <note place="margin">Conr. Pellic. Fr. Vatab. Bibl. Angl. Tremel. Iun. Io. wolp Lyr. Pet. Matt. Fr. Vatabl.

How needfull it was, that these close spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, should be so plainly set in the text (euer to send out expectation further, than to those very parties themselues of whome then it spake) wee may sufficiently per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, first in the Iewes for resting on some that were before, as <hi>Moses</hi> and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,, much more than on Iesus the Sonne of <hi>Mary,</hi> that followed after, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the great workes that he did among them: then in the <hi>Sarazens, Turkes; Persians,</hi> and the Church of Rome too, for resting somuch on others that followed after, <hi>Mahomet,</hi> the blessed Virgin, Angels and Saints.

               </gap> was good and needfull, that euer (now and then) in the next, in the Stories of such as were the meetest to represent the person of Christ vnto vs, there should bee such speeches inserted, as might witnesse that sufficiencie and fulnesse in Christ, as that, in comparison of him, all others might giue place vnto him. How notably there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Ezechias</hi> now did his seruice to God, or how he abolished corruption, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uanced the true worship of God againe, may sufficiently appeare, if wee consider, first what hee did for the time present: then, for the time after ensuing. For that time present hee was notably imployed, first for his owne kingdome onely: then, for his owne and <hi>Israell</hi> together. That which hee did for his owne kingdome onely, was a notable reformation, to set vp againe the true worship of God; in the Story wherof we haue most of it allotted to one speciall time: but one thing there is, that hath not the time allotted vnto it; &amp; it seemeth to haue followed after the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. In that which is allotted to one speciall time, we are directed, first to note the time when he did set in hand therewith; then, what it was that so he did. The <note place="margin">2 Chr. 29. 1, 3 2 King 18 2 <hi>Laur. Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

So falleth it out, that so soone as euer hee came to his kingdome, and in the flower of his yongth, hee gaue himselfe to that seruice of God which after ensueth: a very rare example, and so much the rather to be regarded, as that experience doth commonly teach, that wee all generally at those yeares, especially such as are of greatest estate among vs, are more youthfully giuen, and little regard such matters as those. That which so <note place="margin">2 Chr. 29: 3-11. Ibid. 12-19</note> hee did, was that he opened the doores of the house of the Lord, which his Father <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
               <hi>Achaz</hi> had shut vp before, called the Priests and Leuites together, and gaue charge of sanctifying themselues and clensing the place: and all this so effectually, that the Priestes and Leuites did presently set in hand therewith, and in sixeteen dayes per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed the businesse. Which being done, then <hi>Hezechiah</hi> got vp betime, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether <note place="margin">Ibid. 20-36</note> with his Princes and Nobles presently offered sacrifice vnto the Lord, and set vp that his seruice againe, in very good manner, to the great comfort and ioy of <hi>Hezechiah</hi> himselfe, and of all the assembly besides. In which his Story one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticuler there is, of which, it seemeth to mee, there neede to be some warning giuen: and it is as touching the cleansing of the house of GOD, that heere wee reade of. Which is by diuers accounted to bee, that it was but from Idols, <note place="margin">Lyr. Fra. Vat. Bibl. Angl.</note> and from such thinges as to those Idols, and to theyr woorshipping appertayned.
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:7530:245"/> But seeing <hi>Ahaz</hi> did in the end shut vp the House of the Lord, as wee saw before, and yet was a great worshipper of Idols still, euen to his death, it is not like, that he would so sarre haue abandoned that house and the vse thereof, if he had had any of his Idols there, of which hee made any speciall reckoning. And yet not vnlikely, but that, as there he praeferred that new Altar of his (the fashion whereof hee sent from <hi>Damascus)</hi> vnto the Altar that <hi>Salomon</hi> by Gods appointment had made, and caused the sacrifices to be offered thereon: so might he haue some of his Idols there too for a time, and some of his Idolatrous seruice there also vsed. But seeing it is plain that some time before his death he did quite shut-vp that House, and so it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained vntill the raigne of this <hi>Hezechiah;</hi> and seeing that by the speach of this King vnto the Priestes and <hi>Leuites,</hi> it seemeth that the King and the people before <note place="margin">2 Chr. 29▪ 6, 7</note> had altogether abandoned the vse of that House, together with the worshippe that was there to bee done: it seemeth most likely, that neither had they any of their Idols heere now, not so much as vsed now to sacrifice on that new brasen Altar nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but that some other way they had defiled it, eyther by putting it to prophane vses (as we diuers times do vse such buildings or roomes, as we doe not like of) or else that of purpose they had carried in much baggage and homely matter into it, so to wreake their bad hearts vpon it. Otherwaies the Idols are not like to haue been so many, nor their appurtenances so weighty, but that such a company as it seemeth <hi>Hezechiah</hi> got together at this time, would haue remooued in much lesse time than they did the vncleanesse that now they dealt-with. But that this House of God <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> might fall into so deepe disgrace with them, as that in such sort they would aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don it, yea and vily prophane it too, as before is noted, wee may easily conceiue to be likely enough by the experience wee haue of those that are Image-worshippers with vs, so greatly loathing the Church and true Seruice of God as they doe: and some of them, when they were on a gog, and had it in their hands to do as they list, so vily abusing the Communion-table, the Booke of Common-prayer, yea and the holy Bible it selfe, as they did. That which hee did for his owne Kingdome, and for the Kingdome of <hi>Israell</hi> withall, hath a certaine appendant to it appertaining: and so are we, first to consider of the thing it selfe that so hee did; then, of that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant thereunto appertaining. The thing it selfe was, that hee did so well ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther them altogether, to the holding of Passe-ouer vnto the Lord, when the time was so farre spent as now it was. For it was to be celebrated the fourteenth day of the first month, at Eeuen, whereas these had now already spent sixteen daies of this <note place="margin">Exod. 12: 6</note> first moneth in clensing the House, and were themselues legaly so farre polluted thereby, that they might not offer the Passe-ouer vnto the Lord: but in such case were to rest vntill the fourteenth day of the second moneth, to be ready then to do it, and not to faile; as God by occasion had taken order long before. Now there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the King, according to the liberty that God had giuen therein, determining to <note place="margin">Num. 9: 6-14</note> keepe that Feast vnto the Lord, &amp; desirous to gather thereunto not onely the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of his owne Kingdome, but all the <hi>Israelites</hi> besides, sent speciall Messengers abroad to that purpose throughout all their quarters: wherein although he got but <note place="margin">2 chr. 30: 1-27</note> a mocke for his labour of many of them; yet were there diuers of them that came in maruelous well, and putting-too their handes to destroy certaine Idolatry first, did in good manner performe the businesse they had in hand. Not but that many of them did it not altogether in so good manner as they ought to haue done, being <note place="margin">Ibid. 17-20</note> so disaccustomed thereunto as they were; but that they did it with good hearts, and so well as their skill did then serue them: and that the King, perceiuing that all was not so perfectly on all hands done as it ought to haue been, besought God for them, and obtained such fauour as that he did not lay those defects vnto the charge of any of them. But otherwise the whole assembly were so zealously bent now, &amp; both the King and the Princes were so liberall towards them, that needes they would hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note place="margin">Ibid. 21-27</note> this solemnity seauen daies more of their owne accord, worshipping the Lord, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> and reioycing together in him, so as neuer since <hi>Salomons</hi> time they had done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; and then were they by the Priestes and <hi>Leuites</hi> accordingly dismissed in very good manner: but not so content, before they would returne home againe, they
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:7530:245"/> went altogether throughout <hi>Iudah, Beniamin, Ephraim</hi> and <hi>Manasseh,</hi> and destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <note place="margin">2 Chr. 31: 14 2 King. 18:</note> both the Idols yet remaining, and the High-places and Groues withall, and then returned. The appendant hereunto appertayning, is of the <hi>Israelites</hi> onely, and it is no more but this, that notwithstanding that now they did come in so well vnto the Lord as they did; yet shortly after, euen in the dayes of this <hi>Hezechiah,</hi> and in the fourth yeare of his raigne began that heauy iudgement of God to seaze vppon <note place="margin">2 kin 18: 9-12</note> them, euen in the beginning of it, and before the sixt yeare of his raigne was ended, did fully possesse it selfe of them: namely, that the <hi>Assirians</hi> came in so strongly vpon them, that they destroyed most of them, took away the rest captiue, &amp; placed others in their roomes there; so that now they ceased, from this time forward, to bee any more a people. A good patterne to shewe, that when wee are euen at the best, yet then are wee odious inough vnto GOD: and that the plague which Fathers haue before deserued, may iustly also fall on their Children, without any impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the iustice of God. Yet is it a good warning withall, to all the Idolatrous sort whatsoeuer, that they doe not rashly iudge of the hand of GOD vppon his people: as here it may bee they would happily take it, as if that hand of God had beene so vppon them, for that now they had so turned to GOD, and put downe those idols, together with those High-places and groues, where the people did so corruptly woorshippe. For the time ensuing, hee likewise tooke order, both that <note place="margin">2 chr. 31: 2-21</note> the Priestes and Leuites should doe their dutie; and that the people should bring them in their due, in such sort as God before had appointed: and this latter the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple so readily did, that the parties themselues confessed they had great plenty. Whereuppon the King tooke farther order, that those roomes should be repayred which were to keepe that kind of prouision for the continuall maintenance of them, and that there all such thinges should be laid vp, so to bee in a readinesse for them. And what state or people soeuer they are, that woulde haue a Ministerie to serue, they also must accordingly prouide for their due maintenance too: the better Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie they will haue, the nearer to come to that allowance that GOD appoynted; and the farther they will stand of from it, or the more they will take it short when once it hath beene layde foorth vnto them, the more must they want the blessing that otherwise GOD would haue bestowed on them thereby. As also it is good, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> here to marke, that when now that wonted allowance which God had before pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed vnto thē, was discontinued, they did not cast by that occasion to abridge it or take it in, much lesse to withdraw it, and to set them downsome pention for it, or to leaue it to euery mans iudgement to allowe them that which the giuers should think a competent stay: but cast their eies to the originall, marking what God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe had ordained, and framing out their allowance now by the pattern of it. That which hath not the time allotted vnto it, and seemeth to haue followed after the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <note place="margin">Num 21: 8, 9</note> is, how he dealt with that brasen Serpent which <hi>Moses</hi> by the appointment of God had set vp in the wildernes long before: namely, that it also he brake in pieces, <note place="margin">2 King 18: 4</note> because he vnderstood that before those daies the people had taken vp a dustom to b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> incense vnto it; and (belike when some did not seeme to conceiue well that so he did) said that it was but a piece of brasle. That it seemeth he did this after the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, doth probably arise, both out of the Text it selfe, and out of the nature of that abused creature. In the text it followeth after the other: first, but briefly, reciting or but going to the head of that, which elsewhere wee haue more fully described; and then more specially deliuering this. In the nature of the creature abused, wee may note, that those idols which hee destroyed were but the fictions of men; and those very absurd &amp; foolish: but that this brazen Serpent was first erected by God himselfe; &amp; that by it, when time was, God did miraculously giue present recouery to his people, such as were deadly stung with serpents when they did but look on it, so the better to lead vs to him whose figure it was Most likely therfore it is, that he, minding reformation, woudl first begin with those grosse idols: and then come to this also in the end. But what time so euer he did it, though some thinges there bee that may seeme to make some question in it, whether hee did well therein or not: yet is it, beeing better considered, a fact that is woorthy of speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:7530:246"/> regard. True it is, that it was first set vp by God, that by it, it pleased him to giue recouery to the people, and that therein it was an Image of Christ, and both an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable and a liuely repraesentation of him: and true againe, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> plaine tearmes the Text dooth not commend him for it, but may seeme to leaue it in suspense whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he did well therein or not. But then it is plaine againe, that it is in the Text it selfe recited among his good works: and that his sincerity and zeale is there com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> aboue many others who neuerthelesse are commendable too, for that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed the High-places and Groues, which those others suffered to stand. And as for the learned that followed, there is not any quaestion with any that yet I haue seen, (neither might there iustly be) but that it is there set downe to his commendation. So may we account this fact of his very commendable euen by the Text it selfe, though it be not in plaine tearmes commended: and so doth leaue vs a good lesson, both for those that are in authority, and for the people: namely, that neyther those that are in authority do suffer such among their people, nor the people repine to haue such things abolished, as whose first &amp; right vse is now extinct or determined, or at least but need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse, and whereon since there is grown any such abuse as is dangerous to others: and herein not to regard, though the first institution of it were to speciall good purpose, and very honourably (as it were) descended withall; as the vse of this was once very great, and no meaner than God himselfe the Author of it?</p>
            <p n="16">16 How it pleased God to blesse him for this and all other his good seruice to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> him, is so much the rather to be marked, for that we shall find, that as he was indeede specially blessed: so was he notwithstanding held in speciall exercise too. Hee was specially blessed, for that it is plainely recorded, first but generally, that the Lord was <note place="margin">2 King. 18: 7 2 Chr. 31: 21 32: 2-8, 30. 2 King. 18: 8 2 Chr. 32: 2-8, 27-29.</note> with him, and that he prospered, euen in all things that he tooke in hand: then more specially, both that he praeuailed much against the <hi>Philistims;</hi> and was very great and mighty at home in honor and works that were sutable thereunto, and in great abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of treasure and riches. That notwithstanding he was held in speciall exercise too, it is so much the rather to be marked, for that as yet we doe not find that any spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall way he offended: vnlesse it were in with-drawing himselfe and his people from <note place="margin">2 King. 18: 7 Ibid. 16: 7-9</note> that subiection wherein they were by his Father <hi>Ahaz</hi> before, which also wee doe not finde to be reprooued in him. For as touching that where-with he is charged, that he was not so thankfull to God, as hee ought to haue beene, that was not yet, <note place="margin">2 Chr. 33: 25 26.</note> but afterward onely, as by the course of the Story it is deliuered vnto vs: namely, after that first he had beene sicke, and was now againe deliuered from that his sicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. Which that we may the better perceiue, we are to note, that for the first thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene yeares of his raigne, it seemeth he was quiet (sauing that in that time the <hi>Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites</hi> were taken away, as we read before) and occupyed, as we heard, in abolishing Idolatry, and in planting true Religion and the right worship of God againe. But now in the foureteenth yeare of his raigne, hee had, as it seemeth, all the exercise <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> that now we speake of: both the inuasion of the <hi>Assyrians;</hi> and his sicknesse. The <hi>Assyrian,</hi> it might seeme, inuaded the Land twice: first, till he was pacified by <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiah,</hi> and that which he sent him; then, when he besiedged <hi>Hierusalem</hi> it selfe, and departed not till he lost in one night the most part of his Army. When hee was pacified by <hi>Hezechiah,</hi> and the praesent that he did send him, it is plainely set downe, <note place="margin">2 King. 18: 13-16.</note> that it was in the foureteenth yeare of his raigne. When he besiedged <hi>Hierusalem</hi> it selfe, and departed not but when he had that losse of his Army, is likewise set down <note place="margin">Isai. 36: 1.</note> to bee in the same foureteenth yeare of his raigne. So it appeareth heereby, that both these inuasions were but one, or atleast came very nigh together, and had not <note place="margin">

So when <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zechiah</hi> had yet no way offended, but had done speciall good seruice to God, and had set himselfe in hand therewith euen at his first entering into his Kingdome, and that very zealously too, neuerthelesse it pleased GOD to exercise him with some kinde of tribulation withall, and into that sweete cup of prosperity that hee gaue him to drinke, to put in some bitter ingredients besides to mingle with it. Those were, first, by certaine of his enemies: then, by his owne bodily infirmity. Those enemies of his were the <hi>Assyrians,</hi> now growing vppe a-pace to a mighty state, to whom <hi>Ahaz</hi> his Father before had submitted himselfe and his Kingdome, to bee holpen by them against the <hi>Syrians</hi> then ioyning with <hi>Israell</hi> against him: and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> to whom it seemeth that <hi>Ezechiah</hi> also had yeelded some tribute (such as his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had done before him) for some parte of his raigne (how long, wee know not;) but that after, when hee grew more mighty, hee denied to bee so farre in subiection, and leaned rather to the <hi>Aegyptians.</hi> For as touching the <hi>Assyrians,</hi> the Text dooth plainely say, both that hee rebelled against the King of <hi>Assyria</hi> and <note place="margin">2 King. 18: 17</note> serued him not, or acknowledged now no allegeance vnto him; and that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>Ezechiah</hi> himselfe confessed, that hee had offended, and now would yeelde <note place="margin">Ibid. 14. Ibid. 21. 24 Isa. 36: 6, 9</note> what should bee imposed on him: and as touching the <hi>Aegyptians, Rabsakeh</hi> doth plainely charge him (whether truely or not, wee cannot say) that hee leaned vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them. Now it may well bee, that <hi>Hezechiah</hi> conceiued, that seeing hee had so truly done his seruice to God, he might now safely withdraw his allegeance from the <hi>Assyrians;</hi> and that God would second him in it: but, if so he conceiued, he did but deceiue himselfe therein. For now the <hi>Assyrians</hi> came in so strongly vpon <note place="margin">2 King. 18: 13-16.</note> him, that he was fain to yeeld to very hard conditions to be rid of them againe; euen to yeeld himsefe to beare whatsoeuer they should lay vpon him: which also went so hard with him (for he laid vpon him three hundred Talents of siluer, and thirty Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents of Gold: able to wage an Army of sixe hundred thousand men, by the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <note place="margin">Ibid 14.</note> wee heard of hiering the <hi>Israelites</hi> before; the Golde in this beeing in valew <note place="margin">2 Chr. 25: 6</note> aequiualent vnto the Siluer) that hee was faine to empty all the Coffers both of the Lords House &amp; of his owne; and because that would not serue, to riue or rent off those Plates of Gold that himselfe before had dedicated (an hard shift) to the House of the Lord. So that seeking to deliuer himselfe from that his chasticement, he now made it much harder vnto him: and so it pleaseth GOD to deale some-times euen with the best Seruants hee hath, both to holde them vnder correction: and if they doe not quietly beare that, then to enlarge it farther vnto them. Neyther was this all, as it seemeth, that came in vppon this, for that, as wee noted before, it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth that this was all one voyage, when now he came to <hi>Ierusalem</hi> also: and then, that though hee tooke what was sent (and that, belike now, but as part of his owne, and meaning to be his owne caruer for more) yet would hee not so rest, but held on his course in hostility still. In which second part of his voyage, it shal bee good for vs to mark, first what is done by the parties themselues, or what it is that passeth betwixt them: then, how God in the end taketh vp the matter himselfe. The parties are, on the one side, <hi>Senacherib</hi> the King of the <hi>Assyrians,</hi> and certaine of his Captains with part of his Army: on the other, <hi>Hezechiah</hi> the King of Iudah, and certaine others be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides with him.

His Captaines did according to his direction; and <note place="margin">2 King. 18: 17-38. 2 Chro. 32: 16, 18, 19.

When those Commissioners of <hi>Hezechiah</hi> returned from that their parly, and certified the King of the manner of it, he was much troubled thereat: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <note place="margin">2 King. 18: 36. 37. 19: 1-4. Isa. 36: 21, 22 37: 1▪ 4. 2 Chr. 32: 20.</note> both he sent certaine of the chiefe about him, in Sacke-cloth, vnto the Prophet <hi>Isaiah</hi> to pray for them; and himselfe in Sacke-cloth likewise (after their penitenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all manner) went vp to the House of the Lord, there to seeke for fauour of him. To this the Prophet <hi>Isaiah</hi> answered comfortably, that <hi>Hezechiah</hi> needed not to seare: <note place="margin">2 king. 19: 5-7 Isa. 37: 5-7 2 King. 19: 8-13. Isa 37: 8-13. 2 Chr. 32: 17</note> that his enemie should do no hurt there, but returne and perish at home. When <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacherib</hi> remoued from <hi>Lachis</hi> and went to <hi>Libnah</hi> (which was, as it seemeth, vpon a feare that he conceiued, that the <hi>Ethiopians</hi> were cōming to ioyne with <hi>Hezechiah</hi> against him; and, it may be, as to a more conuenient place, to stop their passage, or to be better secured himselfe) then sent he other Messengers, and a letter with them, to the same end as before, but now to hasten him vnto it, for feare that hee might not tarry about it. Which his letter when <hi>Hezechiah</hi> had receiued, and read, he againe went vp to the House of the Lord (he hauing all his refuge in him) and spread the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <note place="margin">2 King. 19: 14-19. Isa. 37: 14-20</note> before him, as acquainting him with the insolency and blasphemy of it, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firing him to take notice of it: and, in that his distresse, to helpe him. We do not reade that now at this time he sent to the Prophet againe; but went himselfe direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to God by prayer: but God doth now by the Prophet send him a more comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <note place="margin">2 King. 19: 20-34. Isa. 37: 21-35</note> message than before, being first more largely made, and confirmed by a signe; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> then, for his farther confirmation repeated againe, and more expresly therein deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto him. These thinges being passed betwixt the parties, and being now to see, how God in the end tooke vp the matter himselfe, we find that he made a quick <note place="margin">2 Kings. 19: 35-37. 2 Chro. 32: 21. 22. Isa. 37: 36-38</note> and a ready dispatch of it there, in one night (and euen the same after which the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet had sent him this second message; and so the Lord made no long tarrying ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in) destroying of the most valiant men of his Army, one hundred fourscore and fiue thousand, so that hee was faine to hast home with shame; and himselfe likewise at home, in the Temple of his owne Idoll, euen as hee was worshipping it, and by such as came of his owne bowels also. Which so effectually wrought in the hearts of others, that many brought offerings vnto <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> there to offer them vnto the <note place="margin">2 Chr. 32: 23</note> Lord; and praesents likewise vnto the King: so that now hee was, from this time for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, had in much more honour than before. That which was bee his bodily infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, was a grieuous sicknesse which that yeare also he had: as touching which his sickenesse, first we haue the Story of that his sicknesse it selfe set down vnto vs; then, of one other thing thereunto appertaining. In the Story of his sicknesse it selfe, we find for a time, that his life was despaired: but that soone after there was good hope of recouery againe. His life was a time despaired, first by the extremity of the sicknesse it selfe: then much more, by a message the Prophet brought him. The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity <note place="margin">2 King. 20: 21 2 Chr. 32: 24 Isa. 38: 1.</note> of the sicknesse it selfe was such, that it is sayde he was sicke vnto death, or so dead sicke, as we tearme it, that there was no hope of recouery in him. The mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage that the Prophet brought him, consisted of two principall partes; and both of the Lord: one, to put his house in order; the other, the reason why so he should do, namely, that he should not liue, but dy. A good order to bee obserued of all, and <note place="margin">2 King. 20: 1 Isa. 38: 1.</note> so much the rather, seeing the direction is from God himselfe, that wee should set things in order when we see that God is about to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

In that hope of recouerie that soone after arose vnto him, wee haue noted vnto vs, first whereuppon it arose vnto him: then, what was the thing it selfe. It arose vnto him (as out of a secondarie cause) out of his great sorrow thereon, and praier to God, that <note place="margin">2 King. 20: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

His assurance was, first by the word of the Prophet; then, by a signe: and both of GOD. The word was, that before the Prophet was yet gone out of the house, the Lord willed <note place="margin">2 king. 20: 4-6 2 Chr. 32: 24 Isa. 38: 4-6</note> him to returne againe, and to tell the King, that on those his teares and prayer he had <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> taken compassion on him: and both would giue him fifteene yeares longer; and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer him besides from those his enemies the <hi>Assyrians.</hi> The signe that was giuen him, was giuen vpon the Kings demand; and wherein himselfe had some choice too: <note place="margin">1 kin 20: 8-11 2 Chr. 32: 24 Isa. 38: 7, 8, 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </note> and it was, that the shaddow in a Sunne-dyall there, should goe back ten such spaces or portions as in that Dyall were noted. But of what quantity of time those spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces were, whether full houres, or more or lesse; as also, whether but onely the shad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow went backe so farre (which was sufficient for that purpose, beeing miraculous enough in it selfe) or whether the Sun it selfe went so farre backe too: as the Text it selfe dooth not declare it, so neyther are the learned agreed on it. According to <note place="margin">2 King. 20: 7 Isa. 38: 21</note> which promise before, and confirmation after by the signe that was giuen, the King taking a Medicine that the Prophet praescribed, he did recouer. That one other thing heereunto appertaining, is, that writing of <hi>Hezechiah</hi> which hee made vppon this his <note place="margin">Isa. 38: 9-20</note> sicknesse and recouery againe: wherein hee seemeth to haue it a principall part of his meaning, to confesse against himselfe the great infirmity of his mind therein, taking it so discomfortably, yea and so vnquietly as he did, that hauing been so carefull as he was to serue God, neuerthelesse he must then bee so soone cut off in the flower of his yeares, when he was not yet forty yeares old, and had not raigned full fourteene yet; but in the end hee acknowledgeth the goodnesse of God therein, and promiseth to be thankfull for it. Wherein it seemeth, that we may very well note (as indeede it is true, that all men haue there wants, euen the best that are) two speciall defectes in this good King; one, that he had no better comfort in that his way-gate; the other, that he did no highlier extoll that so speciall fauour of God in his recouery. For as touching that Way-gate of his, or that his departure that was threatned vnto him, God be thanked there are so faire promises made, &amp; so great good things assured vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs, in the estate next after ensuing, that although the flesh may well be allowed by course of Nature, to abhorre and repine at our dissolution, especially if wee haue some good estate heere, as hee, it may bee, accounted hee had: yet may the faithfull bee very willing, if so it please God, to leaue and abandon whatsoeuer they haue heere, to attaine vnto that which is prouided for them there; and not onely willing, but euen glad and ioyfull, whensoeuer they see the time approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, that they may bee allowed that happy passage. So likewise, that hee could not so rest in the word of the Prophet for his recouery, and yet could so easily doe it for his departure before, but that now hee must needes haue a signe, when neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse that Prophet was nowe of very speciall reckoning, and long had beene a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> knowne man among them, and knowne that God was wont to deale by him (for he had prophecied all the time of <hi>Ahaz</hi> his Father, <hi>Iotham</hi> his Grand-Father, and part <note place="margin">Isa. 1: 1.</note> of the raigne of <hi>Ʋzziah</hi> his great Grand-Father also, all Kinges of <hi>Iudah)</hi> when as God now not only bare with that his great infirmity, but yeelded vnto him and gaue him a signe, and that a very rare one too; and not onely gaue him a speedy and a full recouery but added fifteene yeeres more to his life (a sauour that he neuer heard to bee vouchsafed to any before, nor wee since:) howe likely a thing is it, that any man (lightly) would in such case bee so affected with so strange and admyrable fauour, that hee could not tell, eyther how to beginne, or how to take vp in extol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of it; especially such an one, as was so troubled to heare of his departure be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
            <p n="17">17 Neuerthelesse these are none of those infirmities that we spake of before: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
               <pb n="472" facs="tcp:7530:248"/> these latter beeing but onely defects; and that other (his feare of death) so incident vnto the nature of Man, that it is to be easily censured in any. But those infirmities that we spake of then, and of which wee are to consider now, are but onely those, where-with he is afterward charged: and in those wee are to marke, not onely what those his infirmities were; but withall, how the Lorde did remember him for them. Such as they were, they are, some of them onely noted generally: but one of them, more specially. Those that are noted generally, are two: one, vnthankfulnesse; the other, as the Fountaine whence it proceeded, loftinesse of minde. Wherein he <note place="margin">2 Chr. 32: 25</note> was vnthankfull wee haue not noted vnto vs, nor plaiuely to whom: but in that it is saide, that he did not render according to the reward or fauour that on him was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed, and wee read not of any such speciall fauour bestowed on him but onely by God, and part of it by the Ministery of <hi>Isaiah</hi> the Prophet; out of this it may seeme that it may bee probably gathered, that one way or other hee was not so dutifull to God as be ought to haue beene, or not so regardfull to <hi>Isaiah.</hi> And true it is, that experience teacheth, that good Princes can hardly brooke sometimes, to bee in any thing crossed by a Prophet, as wee sawe in <hi>Asa</hi> and <hi>Amaziah</hi> before: and this Story <note place="margin">2 Chr. 15: 10. 25: 15, 16 2 Kings. 20: 16-18. Isa. 39: 5-7</note> that now we are in, doth plainely shew, that shortly after this Prophet wee speake of came to <hi>Hezechiah,</hi> as sent from the Lord, and reprooued one speciall thing hee had done. So likewise, wherein his heart was so lifted vp, or wherein he had that lofti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of minde, we haue not set downe vnto vs: but an vsuall thing it is, and very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident vnto the Nature of Man, eyther in prosperity, or vppon any speciall endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (yea and vpon a vaine conceite of our owne too, that some such matter is in vs <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> that is not) in all such cases to take vpon vs, not onely before men, but ouer-often, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen before God too. For these it pleased God so to remember him and his people <note place="margin">2 Chr. 32: 25 26.</note> too, that wrath came both vpon him, and vpon <hi>Iudah</hi> and <hi>Hierusalem</hi> withall; not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding, that they humbled themselues when they had so done: but not in the dayes of <hi>Hezechiah;</hi> neyther is it declared what that wrath was that heere is spoken of. But seeing that much wrath did afterward indeede fall vpon them, in the daies of all the Kinges that followed, euen in the dayes of <hi>Iosiah,</hi> the best of them all (in the end of his raigne) but then especially when the people and their Citties were for the most part destroyed, and such of the people as remained, carryed away captiue to <hi>Babylon:</hi> hence may we learne, that euen the best men we haue, may by their slidings be some part of the cause, of those heauy iudgements that others more wicked doe plucke vpon them. That one infirmity of his, which is more specially noted vnto <note place="margin">2 Kings. 20: 12, 13. 2 Chr. 32: 31 Isa. 39: 1, 2</note> vs, is, that hee was so open vnto the Ambassadors of the King and Princes of <hi>Babell,</hi> who came to congratulate his recouery vnto him, and to inquire of that wonder that was a little before doone in the Lande (that, it seemeth, which was giuen him for a signe that hee should recouer) acquainting them very vnaduisedly with his whole e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state, euen with his very treasure too: but noted withall, that the Lorde left him therein to himselfe; and so may teach vs, how vndiscreetely the best of vs all may car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry our selues, when we are not specially assisted by God. The punnishment that he had for this, was, that the Prophet denounced vnto him from the Lorde, that a time <note place="margin">2 Kings. 20: 14 19. Isa. 39: 3-8</note> would come, when all those goodly rich thinges of his, and all that his Progenitors had to that day gathered together, shoulde goe as a prey to <hi>Babylon;</hi> and that his Seede should bee brought into subiection and seruice there: neuerthelesse, that this should not be till after his time; and the King was glad that it pleased God to vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safe him that fauour. A faire warning for all others much rather, not to rouse our selues in those earthly thinges that God dooth giue vs; but to bee so much the more carefull to serue the giuer of them, and our selues to feare, or in humility of minde to beare a low saile in them: as also, that whereas we get so immoderately such thinges together to make our Children great, if our selues glory in them in the meane season, we may thereby ouerthrow all that prouision vnto our Children, and bring them to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> slauery too. Neuerthelesse, <hi>Hezechiah</hi> for his time had such peace, and did so shut vp the course of his life, in so good account with his people, that in his buriall they did him the most honour they could. <note place="margin">2 Chr. 32: 33</note>

But heerein we shall see, that neither this sharpe warning that now God had giuen them, neyther this good time that after it they had to settle themselues vnto better, did much auaile them; but that still they were afterward such as they were before: first, for the time that immediatly followed; then, for all the rest of their time that after ensued. In the time that immediatly followed, was the raigne of <hi>Manasseth,</hi> succeeding his Father <hi>Hezechias</hi> in the Kingdome. In whose time, <note place="margin">

But then we haue it deliuered withall, that afterward he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented him of his Idolatry and looser waies, and restored the true worship of God againe: but neither is it plainely set downe, neyther may it (so farre as I see yet) by circumstance be gathered about what time of his raigne it was that so hee repented. The <hi>Hobrewes</hi> are of opinion, and S. <hi>Hierom,</hi> it seemeth, by them, that a long time he was in that his amendment. But seeing in the Bookes of the Kinges there is no mention at all of his repentance, but altogether of his foule Apostasie and sin, and <note place="margin">2 King. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

So likewise, seeing himselfe was not able to gouerne his Kingdome when first hee came to it, being then but twelue yeares old; and we heard noted before, that <hi>Hezechiah</hi> his Father was not the man towardes God that he ought to haue beene, after al those fauours receiued: hence may it seeme, that <hi>Hezechiah</hi> himselfe, towards the ende of his raigne, did grow more carelesse of Religion than before; both for that hee left so corrupt men behinde him to haue the gouernment of his Sonne, as, it seemeth he did; and for that there is such probability as there is, that his Sonne also was no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter instructed. Who at those yeares, with reasonable industry or paines taking, might other-wise haue beene brought to some reasonable good vnderstanding and knowledge of the truth: and, if his Father had been resolute and forward it is most likely (by the vsuall course of Gods dealing) to some special good liking therof also. In what sort he offended, during the time (whether it were lesse or more) that he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boade in that his since, wee haue not onely set downe what his sinne <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

In that which is set downe more specially of him, first wee haue noted what he did else-where in all other places besides: then, what hee did in the house of the Lord. In his doinges else-where, hee is first noted to bee contrary to his Father, building vp the High-places againe, that his Father had broken downe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; <note place="margin">Ibid. 3. 2 Chr. 33: 3</note> and to bee like vnto <hi>Ahab,</hi> both in erecting Altars to <hi>Baal,</hi> and making a Groue (a degenerate Imp in the meane season:) and that besides, hee worshipped all the hoast of Heauen, and serued them. Comming to the House of the Lorde, first for the House it selfe, he built Altars (to others) there (as we in our Churches, <note place="margin">Ibid. 4, 5. 2 Chr. 33: 4, 5</note> haue worshipped others also) which house was ordained onely for him: then, in both the Courts of the house, he built Altars also, euen to all the Hoast of Heauen. Such as in this place did more specially concerne himselfe, are the next that follow: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> and therein haue wee noted, first what those thinges were; then, as it seemeth, in what measure he imployed himselfe therein. They were, that he caused his Sons <note place="margin">Ibid 6. 2 Chr. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

The measure by which it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth he imployed himselfe therein, belike was great, for that it is said he wrought much euill (therein it seemeth, or at least it may be so taken too, if otherwise it bee not more generall) in the sight of the Lord, to anger him withall. In the latter of them, there is but one thing noted wherein he drew in the people to offend with him: but in this, wee haue not onely that particular fault of his; but also how the Lord was offended with him and the people, for this and the rest. In his fault we haue noted likewise, not onely what that fault of his was: but, more plainely heere than before, how he drew in the people with him. His fault now was, that hauing made a certaine Image of a Groue, that did hee set in house of the Lord likewise. <note place="margin">Ibid. 7. 2 Chr. 33: 7 Ibid. 7. 2 Chr. 33: 7 Ibid. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>3: 10</note> Which sinne of his, is againe amplyfied by the originall vse of the place: first towardes GOD, that it was properly dedicated to him; then, on behalfe of the people, that it was a pledge vnto them, that they should neuer remooue thence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, if they obserued for their part the couenant betwixt them. He so drew in the people with him, that they obeyed not (according to their couenant before) but were led out of the way by him, to doe more wickedly than the Heathen peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple whom the Lord (for their wickednesse) destroyed before the Children of Israel. The Lord was so offended with him and the people for this and the rest, that hee tooke purpose to bring heauy iudgments on them for it: and to that end by certain of his Seruants the Prophets he acquainted them with it, and namely, that he wold deale with them as he had done with <hi>Samaria</hi> and the house of <hi>Ahab</hi> before, euen vtterly forsaking them, and deliuering them ouer to their enemies on euery side; but they made no reckoning thereof. That which in this place did more special<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concerne himselfe, was, that he shed much innocent bloud, and, as it were, euen <note place="margin">Ibid. 16.</note> filled <hi>Hierusalem</hi> with it. In which point, the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> do more specially charge him, that notwithstanding hee had married the Prophet <hi>Isaies</hi> Daughter (as they also conceiue) yet he spared not him neyther, but most cruelly put him to death a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong others. But it may probably seeme, that if it were so, it would haue beene mentioned heere, both for the strangenesse of the fact, and for the dignity of <hi>Esaies</hi> person, being so notable a Prophet long as he had beene, and of such Parent age as it seemeth hee was. The punnishment that at this time they had for this, is but <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> breefely described; as if all were shut vp in the person of the King: namely, that the Lord brought vppon them the Captaines of the Hoast of the King of <hi>Ashur,</hi> who <note place="margin">2 Chr. 33: 11</note> tooke <hi>Manasses,</hi> and put him in Fetters, and bound him with Chaines, and so carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to <hi>Babel.</hi> But when as so they dealt with the King, wee may well conceiue, that there were many others that smarted besides. In the rest of their time that after ensued, they were twice set vp againe; but stood no better than before: so that in eyther of them wee are to see, first how they were againe set vp; then, how ill it was that they stood. The former of these was in the daies of him that now wee
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:7530:249"/> speake of; and of his Sonne who next succeeded him in his King <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 word">

               </gap>: they being againe set vp in the former of them; and falling downe againe in the latter. As touching their setting vp again by <hi>Manasses</hi> the former of the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> that now we speak of, we are giuen to vnderstand, that in that his tribulation he humbled himselfe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord, and in such sort sought vnto him, that the Lord was intreated of him, <note place="margin">2 Chro. 33: 12, 13. Ibid. 14-17</note> and so brought him home againe, and restored him vnto his Kingdome: and that he thereupon (besides some other workes that hee did) <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>olished the Idolatry hee had set vp, and aduaunced the true worship of God again; and yet not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, but that the people did sacrifice still in the High-places, though to none other now but onely to God. A kinde of reformation that in some part <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> that is to be seene in ouer many of the greater sort of ours also: especially, so farre as our seuerall Churches may bee resembled to that Temple of theirs; and the greater sort among vs to that whole people of them. For albeit, that among vs also corrupt Religion be much abolished, and the true worship of God againe restored: yet the greater sort among vs euery where almost, do but few of them, and seldome repaire to their Parish-Churches, there to worship with the rest of their bretheren in the congregation, to help forward others by their example; but onely worship, or haue Diuine Seruice at home in their owne houses (and that sometimes by Lads too, or some base seruant of theirs) in such High-places as they haue there, yet (God bee thanked) doing their worship onely to God. But now for the people of <hi>Iudah</hi> generally, seeing Idolatry was now abolished, and the true worship of God resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto them, they might not deny, but that now they were in good measure set vp or restored againe: though yet notwithstanding his credit was not so raised a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong his owne people, but that (whatsoeuer conceit they had of him) when hee died, they did not vouchsafe to bury him among the Kinges his praedecessors, but <note place="margin">2 King. 20: 18 2 Chr. 33: 20</note> onely in his owne Garden at home.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Their falling away at this time is not plainely set down, but onely imployed: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> namely, that <hi>Manasses</hi> being departed <hi>Amon</hi> his sonne succeeded him in his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Amon.</hi> 15.</note> and raigned two yeares; and was a very bad one, after the former waies of his <note place="margin">2 King. 21: 18. 19. 2 Chr. 33: 20, 21.</note> Father. So, for his departure or falling away, there is nothing spoken, but onely of the King himselfe: but when the King himselfe is so corruptly giuen, wee may easily conceiue, that the people did soone follow after. As touching his Story, his raign, we see, was but short: and so we may easily conceiue, that his Story will not be long. In it we haue, first how he sinned: then, how he was punnished. His sin wee haue set downe, first generally: then, more specially. Generally, that he did euill in thē <note place="margin">2 King. 21: 20 2 Chr. 33: 22 2 King. 21: 21, 22. 2 Chr. 33: 22, 23. 2 King. 21: 23, 24. 2 Chr. 33: 24, 25.</note> sight of the Lord, as his Father <hi>Manasses</hi> did. More specially hee is noted, to haue followed the waies of his father in his Idolatry, and that to haue done more &amp; more; but neuer to haue repented himselfe thereof as his Father had done: and farther to haue added, that he quite forsooke the Lord God of his Fathers, and walked not in his way. His punnishment was, that his seruants conspired against him, and slew him in his owne house: which fact notwithstanding the Lord so auenged by others soone after, that when it had done his iust iudgement on one that had so much pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoked his wrath against him, it might not then stand as an vnpunnished example to others.</p>
            <p n="3">3 The latter of these reacheth throughout the Story of all that follow: and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> first againe, how they were yet once more restored; then, how fouly they fel away af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.

Which when hee did, wee haue noted vnto vs, both how he made his enterance thereinto at the first: and how well he did imploy himselfe therein afterward also. When hee made his enterance thereinto at the first, the first thing that we reade of, was, that hee began to seeke af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <note place="margin">2 Chr. 34: 3</note> the God of <hi>Dauid</hi> his Father: and that so hee did while yet bee was but a child; which also is there noted to bee, in the eight yeare of his raigne, when hee was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout sixteene yeares old. Those good imployments of his that followed after, are sorted to two speciall times of his raigne: some to the twelfth yeare of his raigne, when himselfe was twenty yeares old; others, to the eighteenth of his raigne, when himselfe was sixe and twenty. Vnto the twelfth yeare of his raigne we haue some thinges very plainely ascribed: but then haue wee some others besides, that are not knowne then to be done, but onely by something that followeth after. Those that are in plaine tearmes to it ascribed, are, that hee destroyed Idols and Idolatry, first in <note place="margin">2 Chr. 34: 3-7</note>
               <hi>Iudah</hi> and <hi>Ierusalem:</hi> then, in many Citties of <hi>Israell</hi> besides, such it seemeth as had ioyned themselues to <hi>Iudah.</hi> Those others besides which were done then also, or <note place="margin">Tremel.

Vnto the eighteenth yeare of his raigne, when he was of the age of sixe and twenty, are diuers thinges ascribed: some that the King had in purpose to do; others that fell out by occasion. That which hee had in purpose to doe; was, that by that time hauing gotten some reasonable quantity of Money in, <note place="margin">2 King. 22▪ 3. 23: 23. 2 Chr. 34: 8. 35: 19.</note> they set in hand with repairing of the Lordes House: and that as themselues had so good a care of it, so it pleased God to blesse them with such workmen, as dealt very well and faithfully with them in the businesse to them committed. In that which fell out by occasion, we are to consider, first, of the occasion we speake of: then, of that which was done thereupon. The occasion was in that the High-Priest, finding a Booke of the Lawe, as hee was repairing or clensing the Temple, acquainted the <note place="margin">2 King. 22: 8-10. 2 Chr. 34▪ 14-18.</note> King therewith, by those Messengers that the King had sent vnto him about other businesse. That which was done thereunto, was, first to vnderstand the will and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> pleasure of God therein: then, to doe thereafter so neere as he could. To vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the will and pleasure of God therein, first he sought but vnto the Booke that so was sent him: but then hee sought farther to the Lord himselfe. He sought but vnto the Booke that was sent him, when he gaue eare to the reading of it: but that <note place="margin">2 King. 22: 10, 11. 2 Chr. 34: 16-19.</note> it appeareth, he effectually did (a good example, of what force euen Reading also is, with those that are zealous indeede) both for that hee did conceiue that sorrow thereon; &amp; because he did so specially sent about farther enquiry. In that farther inquiry about which he sent, it shall be good for vs to marke what course was held therein: and how to apply it to our vse also. The course that was held therein, was, first on the Kings part, both that he sent very speciall men about it; and that his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection <note place="margin">2 King. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

To our vse we may apply it, if we also doe so resolue, that to inquire of those with whom we see the spirit of God in such sort to be, as that they haue a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerend regard to his holy word, and are of an humble and peaceable temper with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, first in the ordinary Ministery that he hath giuen vs; then also, if it faile there, in any other whatsoeuer, is to inquire of the Lord (at least, so farre as there is nothing
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:7530:250"/> deliuered by them, but that which agreeth with the word it selfe:) and heere, in this Story, we may see, that we haue the iudgement and course of a sort of speciall men, chosen by a godly and a vertuous King, one of them also the High-Priest himselfe, concurring with vs. Neyther at this time did the Prophetesse her-selfe say any more, than any of the Priests or Leuites, or any other that had diligently and in good man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner exercised themselues in the Book of the Law, might out of it as fully haue done: sauing onely, that shee applyed the promise that was made generally to all, to him that now sent to inquire of her; of which another, onely by the word, might also haue giuen a very good hope, though not such certainty as she then did, in that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, the heartes and truth of the wayes of men being knowne onely to God, and to whom it shall please him to reueale them. For the Lord had so opened his mind before for such matters, by the Mynistery of <hi>Moses,</hi> in two seuerall places, to that <note place="margin">Leu. 26: 3-45 Deut▪ 28: 1-6<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </note> end specially directed (besides all others that else-where came in by occasion) that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen out of those only might that censure be gathered, that the Prophetesse now gaue <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> vnto them: especially, if we lay thereunto, that which God himselfe deliuered to <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon,</hi> when he had builded, and did dedicate the Temple vnto him; which it (it may <note place="margin">1 King. 9: 2 9 2 chr. 7: 11-22</note> be) was then also written and added to that Coppy of the Booke of the Law, if not, yet must it of necessity bee of fresh remembrance of them, so many as had regard to such matters. It may be also, that God had not acquainted the Prophetesse howe <hi>Iosias</hi> should in the end ouerthrow himselfe, and by his folly fall into the handes of his Enemies: and that hee opened no more vnto her, but for those matters about which he sent, that none of those should fall in his time; but that, for any thing that thereof should fal vpon him, he should be brought to his Graue in peace. Thus vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the will and pleasure of God for that matter, and therein, that his wrath was sore bent against the whole Land for those Idolatryes of theirs, and other sinnes which they had committed, he setteth in had to make redresse for those matters now: first by gathering the whole people to make a new couenant with God; then, by do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing certaine speciall seruices besides. To gather the whole people to make a newe <note place="margin">2 king. 23: 1-3 2 Chr. 34: 29-32.</note> couenant with God, hee first sent for, and gathered together to <hi>Hierusalem</hi> all the Elders, and the people great and small; and himselfe read, as it seemeth, or at least caused to be read, in the eares of the people, the Booke of the Couenant: then, both himselfe first entered into the couenant, or made couenant with the Lorde, that thence-forward he would doe according to the Lawes and ordinances in that Book praescribed vnto them; and then caused all the people there assembled to do the like. In those speciall seruices that he did vnto God besides, we are to consider, first what they were: then, that although they were speciall seruices indeede, yet did they not praeuaile so farre with God, as we might easily conceiue that they should. To finde out that they were speciall good seruices to God, if we mark, we may note, that they were of two sorts: one, the abolishing of much of the euill that was among them; the other, that he likewise set in hand with some speciall worship of God. The euill that he abolished, was, for the most part, Idolatry, and such things as did belong vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it; but partly also, both that sinne against nature, and Diabolicall Arts and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses <note place="margin">2 King. 23: 4▪ 20, 24. 2 Chr. 34: 33 2 King. 23: 9</note> besides: and not onely for Idolatry, but for other corrupt worshipping also, hee was so resolute (for by his direction it is most likely to bee) that the Priestes of the High-places might not after minister in the House of the Lord (though they in those high places had worshipped none other but onely the Lorde, and not any Idols: for then had their case beene all one with the others) but onely, on theyr conformity, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> were allowed to haue their sustenance with the rest of the Priestes, of the auailes that out of the offerings of the people were allotted vnto them. That speciall worship of God wherewith likewise he did set in hand now, was the ordinary Seruice of God there in the Temple: and holding of a Passe-ouer vnto the Lord. But the former of these is in such sort enterlaced in the Story of the other, that it seemeth, the latter of them was his principall intention: and the former of them, but for the better per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance <note place="margin">2 Chr. 35: 2-6, 10, 11, 15, 16 Ibi. 1, 6-9, 11-14, 16. 17. 2 King. 23: 21</note> of the other. Neuerthelesse it is plaine, that he tooke good order for the former too: and that it was accordingly performed. But the latter of them was performed in very rare manner: not onely the King and his Nobles, the Priestes and
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:7530:251"/> Leuites beeing praesent at it, but the Inhabitantes of <hi>Hierusalem</hi> also, and all Iudah and many of these <hi>Israelites</hi> that then remained; and what by the King and his No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and certaine other principall Fathers, there were giuen vnto it three thousand eyght hundred Bullockes, and of lesser Cattle, Sheepe, Goates, Lambes, and Kids, thirty seauen thousand and sixe hundred. Insomuch that it is plainely saide, that <note place="margin">2 King. 23: 22 2 Chr. 35: 18</note> since the daies of <hi>Samuell,</hi> there was neuer the like: nor, that any of the Kings, euer at any time, kept any such. That neuertheles these good seruices of his, did not so much praeuaile with God, as we might easily conceiue that they should, it shall be good for vs not onely to note, what it is which heere to that purpose is said: but that our selues doe marke likewise, whether wee may not espy some such defect therein, as that wee may the rather account that it is no maruell if they praeuailed no farther than they did. That which here to that purpose is said, is, that when it is before acknowledged, that none of the Kinges before him were in godly disposition like vnto him: yet dooth it <note place="margin">2 King. 23: 25 Ibid. 26, 27</note> follow immediatly after, that the Lord notwithstanding turned not frō the fiercenes of his wrath; but held on his purpose still to put Iudah out of his sight, as he had don <hi>Israell</hi> before (which was, after the time of Christ, fully performed) and therewithal, euen Hierusalem the head Citty thereof, and the Temple it selfe. The defect that we may see in this his seruice to God, is no more but this: that whereas wee haue so speciall mention of this one Passe-ouer held, it seemeth hee held no moe; especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, seeing he and others were at so great charges with it. But it is plaine, that the Law of God required it to be yearely done: and so it may seeme, that although him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe were passing well minded (as hee hath indeede notable testimony giuen him therein) yet the sway of former disusage dazled his eyes so farre, that himselfe also could rest contented, if he could obtaine of his people, that they would hold one such Passe-ouer vnto the Lord, as now he had done. And true it is indeede, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> when some generall corruption hath once ouer-flowed any people, and for some time hath lien vpon them: then may there be among such, diuers of them sincerely giuen, and maruelous well minded; and yet notwithstanding very defectiue, euen in their best seruices whatsoeuer. But then may this teach vs withall, that it is not sufficient to be passing well mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

Loue mee a little, and loue mee long (a prouerb oft times vsed among vs) may well bee allowed to haue some place in such thinges also: experience it selfe so often teaching, that many (of the greater sort, especially) among vs (and of the meaner too, that in their kinde would, some way or other, be as great as they could) although after a sort they do professe, and seeme to be well minded also, yet seldome doe they frequent the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique exercise of our Religion, but onely after a portly manner; and yet looke that those seldome repairings of theirs vnto it, should by the weight of the pomp or portlinesse of them, counterpois the vsuall repairings of others, nothing indeede so great in shew, but in simplicity and plaine dealing, euery of them (for the most part) as good as theirs.</p>

The Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <note place="margin">2 King. 23: 29, 30. 2 Chr. 35▪ 20-24.</note> it selfe is in effect no more but this.

In which his pittifull ouerthrow, the stranger that this iudgement of God is, that so good a Prince so soone miscarried, without any speciall offence of his that wee read of going before, though there be no question but that God had very iust cause so to cut him off: yet is it good for vs, so much the rather to look into it, and to see whether we also may not espy, that as the case was, there could bee no better end expected of it. That, it seemeth, wee may gather, first for that the Text it selfe doth not shew, that hee had any iust cause so to aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture himselfe as he did: then much rather, for that some things it hath, that seeme to conuince him of inordinate dealing therein.

But what neede hee in such case to giue him battle when as to that end it had beene sufficient to haue beene there with his forces where he thought there might be danger; or so to haue disposed of them, as had been meetest to such a purpose: and not to haue strucken, till he had seene there had beene neede? Those things that are in the Text it selfe, are two: one, how <hi>Pharaoh</hi> endeuoured to satisfie him therein; the other, the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of <hi>Pharaohs</hi> passage. He endeuoured to satisfie <hi>Iosias</hi> in that matter, very order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and carefully, as it seemeth: both sending him word that he meant no <note place="margin">2 Chr. 35: 20, 21.</note> hurt vnto him, and that GOD had sent him against those his enemies against whom hee went (the Text also bearing him witnesse, that hee sayde truely therein;) and warning him besides, not so farre to oppose himselfe against God, least hee sped thereafter. Now true it is, that <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah</hi> could not know him to say truely therein: but seeing hee disclaimed to haue any purpose against him, and farther praetended that the Lorde had sent him about that businesse, and willed him to make hast therein; it had beene no lesse than neighbour-hood or good dealing, betwixt man and man, had required, in such case to haue helde of his handes, till hee had seene farther cause to bee stirring. As touching <hi>Pharaohs</hi> passage, it is commonly taken, that he was to passe thorough the Kingdome of <hi>Iosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as,</hi> or some parte of it (as by those before recited:) and true it is, that <hi>Iudea</hi> did lie much in the way. But wee doe not reade, that hee sent vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him for any passage that way as it is the manner of men in such case to doe: especially such, as meane no hurt vnto them by whom they would passe, as it was professed by the King of <hi>Egypt</hi> in respect of the Kingdome of <hi>Iudah.</hi> So did <hi>Moses</hi> before: first of the <hi>Edomites;</hi> then, of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morites.</hi>

               </gap> that hee went not that way. By the left hand it is most likely hee went: and that might hee doe, eyther by Land, or by Sea. If hee would goe by Land, then was hee to goe along by the Sea-side, called by them the great Sea, and is the same which is called the Middle-Earth-Sea with vs, or the

That one sort of people whom it <note place="margin">2 King 22: 15 17. 2 Chr. 34: 23-25.</note> concerneth more specially, are all Idolatrous and superstitious persons, who may <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> take a speciall good warning here: namely, that they take good heed, that they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue not well of their Idolatry or superstition, if at any time they see, that such as haue opposed themselues against it, as <hi>Iosias</hi> mightily did, haue some hard end in the iudgement of the world, as he also had; though otherwise, in many respectes, euery very fauourable also.</p>
            <p n="5">5 But though <hi>Iosias</hi> himselfe nowe perrished; yet left hee the people in good case for the truth of Religion, and of the worshippe of God among them: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> though very soone after they left it againe; and so continued in the daies of all theyr Kinges that next succeeded. Concerning whom, such is the Story now succeeding, as may iustly seeme to require, first that it bee some-thing considered vppon gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally: but then that wee come to the Story of euery of them more specially. Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally no more but this, that from this praesent, the estate of the Kingdome of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah was very pittifull, and a right patterne of a people vnto whom GOD did lay theyr sinnes to theyr charge, though nothing so deepely as they deserued, yet in great measure too. Now, that their owne sinnes had so deserued, is a matter so plaine, that no body can be ignorant of it. But another thing there is, that it may be, would not bee espyed of many; and yet is right woorthy to bee marked of all: namely, that all this calamity, after a sort, and in some respect descended from <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sias</hi> too; very plainely in respect of his owne person, and to bee doubted too in respect of his Children. In respect of owne person, it was very playnely, for that hee was so prodigall of his owne safety, or did venture it so farre as hee <note place="margin">2 Chr. 35: 24, 25.</note> did: and therefore no maruayle, that all Iudah and Hierusalem generally, the Prophet <hi>Ieremie,</hi> and many others in particular, did so much bewayle that pitty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full accident of his miscarrying. A very speciall good warning to all that haue charge, or vppon whom the good estate of any dependeth, not to bee so care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse of theyr own safety, as many are (euen good Princes too some-times:) least that so they make themselues aunswerable, for whatsoeuer calamity thereby com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth in to others on them depending. In respect of his Children it may be doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, because he had so many of them that came to the stand, and not one of them all of any valew to that purpose: and yet had they better than two and twenty yeares among them, wherein to shew foorth what vertues they had, if they had any; the estate of the Kingdome so long standing, though after that needlesse conflict of <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sias,</hi> but after a ruine-like and weltering manner. For this praesent Story maketh mention of three of them that came to the Kingdome: and one other place there is that maketh mention of the fourth also sometime to haue raigned. Those three <note place="margin">2 King. 23: 30, 34. 2 Chr. 36: 1. 4, 10.</note>

I knowe there be other interpretations of this <hi>Shallum,</hi> nothing at all agreeing to this; but yet thus much may be alleadged for the sense aforesaid: and seeing we haue so vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted warrant, both that <hi>Iosias</hi> had such a sonne, and that he raigned after his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, put case it bee not in all poyntes the best exposition, yet is it sufficient for the matter that now we are in. So <hi>Iosias,</hi> that good King, had foure sonnes; and they all came to the kingdome after their Father (three of them without exception, the fourth also by great probability:) and not one good of them all. It is a thing that may befal l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

But it is much to bee feared, though <hi>Iosias</hi> was a good man himselfe, yet that he had not altogether so speciall care of the good education of his Children, as he ought to haue had: at least, it is ouer sleightly regarded of vs, not onely of the common people, but euen of our great professors too. So may good men, if they take not speciall good heed, be noysome fountaines of some spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall calamity to others.</p>
            <p n="6">6. But now to come to the Story of euery of them more specially, of those three <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Sonnes of <hi>Iosiah</hi> that without exception came to the kingdome after their Father, one there was, that came to the Crown somewhat disorderly, as it seemeth: but the others came more orderly vnto it. He that, it seemeth, came vnto it somewhat dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly, was the next that succeeded, <hi>Iehoahaz,</hi> one of the sonnes of <hi>Iosias,</hi> whome <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iehoahaz.</hi> 17. 2 King. 23: 30, 31. 2 Khr. 36: 1, 2</note> the people after the death of his Father annointed to bee their King: but that out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ceremony of their anointing could little auaile, vnlesse he brought with him a better title, or were of better mind towardes God, than, it seemeth, the Story will yeeld him to be. As touching him therefore we are to consider, first of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to the kingdome; then, of his raigne therein. His comming to the Crowne is therefore the rather to be considered, for that it seemeth he came not orderly vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it: and yet is not so noted by some. That he came not orderly vnto it, may be gathered, first by the estate of the Countrey at that present: then also, by the yeares of his age. The estate of the Countrey at that present was such, as that by likely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood and common reason, none should take that title vpon them, without the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of the King of <hi>Egipt</hi> hauing then so lately preuailed among them somuch as he did. Yet I deny not, but that it may well be that they might. For the text doeth <note place="margin">2 Chr. 35: 21, 24.</note> witnes these two: one, that <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was to make hast in that his voyage; the other that <hi>Iosias</hi> being wounded in the fielde, was had to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and there died. If <hi>Pharaoh</hi> were to make hast, it may very well be, and is the likliest, that hauing then cut in sunder that hinderance to his ready passage by his sword, he would not desire to make any longer stay there; especially, if yet he knew not, that <hi>Iosias</hi> died so soon of the wounds that there was giuen him (as it may very well be he did not:) and it is plaine we haue no story of any thing hee did there at this time; which is likely e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough we should, if here he had done any thing else. His good successe also that <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ioā. wolph. in</hi> 2 <hi>Reg.</hi> 23: 31-37</note> is noted he had in this voiage (namely, that he preuailed against his enemy, and so returned a Conqueror homewards) may be some probability, that he made no tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying here, but went on forward about his businesse. Which if he did, then was not hee to take it so ill, if in that his absence the people did servppe another King: though it had beene the surer and better way, seeing by his sword hee had gotten that interest in them that now he had, to haue sent to him first to haue knowne hys pleasure. And therefore that <hi>Ieoahaz</hi> might not in that case so easily take so much vppon him though the people did freely so bestowe it: for that they, in reasonable good intendment, were not their owne men now to such a purpose, so far as might warrant that his acceptance of it, to stand by any good right vnto him. By the yeares of his age it seemeth to be very plaine, that though hee also were the sonne
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:7530:253"/> of <hi>Iosias,</hi> yet had hee then liuing an elder Brother, to whom by common right the Kingdome did rather belong, than to him. So that in him wee may see a right patterne of many of vs: especially where a second marryage so farre praeuayleth (and else-where too) as that the Heire of the former is put by from his Fathers possessions, and the Childe of the latter taken in to that fauour. In all which cases lightly ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth the Father nor Mother vse that iniurious or hard measure with so resolute mindes, as the Brother taketh the benefite of it, neuer making quaestion of the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse of his Title vnto it: and yet there is a Story recordeth, that <hi>Tz<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

His raigne was but short, continuing onely but three monthes: and so if he got it inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinately, it is plaine that hee had little comfort of it. Neuerthelesse, in that short time that he had, he did sufficiently bewray himselfe what course he would haue held, if he might haue had longer continuance: and withall had of the fruite of his owne wayes in reasonable good measure for the time he continued. Hee bewrayed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe what he would haue beene, by doing so ill in the fight of the Lord, euen as his <note place="margin">2 King. 23: 32</note> elders before had done; and so making proofe in himselfe, that such as are readiest to step to better roomes, are not lightly the meetest for them. In those fruits of his own waies that he reaped thereby, we may well note the aequity of Gods iudgments vpon him: not onely for betaking himselfe to those bad wayes of his corrupt elders; but also for that his ambitious stepping vnto the Kingdome. For the former, he could <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> not be ignorant how much God was offended with the whole Land for those Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries and other abhominations which they had already committed, and what iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments he had determined vpon them for the same: &amp; therefore right worthy, so soon to be discarded, to be put in bonds, and to finish his dayes in dishonour and sorrow, for that he did not altogether abandon those waies that were so offensiue, and not se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously follow the steps of his Father and those better elders of his, so to haue turned aside (if it had beene possible, at least so much as in him was) those heauy iudgments threatned vnto them. For the latter also (if he were an offender therein, as most do account him, and I see not how the Text may be otherwise cleered) whereas in that offence he had partners with him (for it is saide that the people of the Land did an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noint <note place="margin">2 King. 23: 30 2 Chr. 36: 1</note> him King, or made him their King) so may we see that the punishment ensuing did in some sort meete with them both: first with the King that so tooke vppon him; then with the people that so much forgot themselues therein also, stepping in so far as they did betwixt that new Lord of theirs, and the right that hee might account him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to haue ouer them by that ouerthrow that he gaue them and their King when as vnprouoked by him, they crost him the way to impeach his passage. For this theyr new King he forth-with displaced, and put another in his roome: and did not onely displace him, but also put him in bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>des, and tooke him away captiue with him to <hi>Aegipt,</hi> where soone after he dyed. A reward good enough for those that so vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reuerently rush into that sacred place of Supreame authority on earth: and meete also, that him-selfe should with his owne eyes see, to his owne disgrace, his elder Brother by right placed; whom he had put to such disgrace before, by stepping into
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:7530:254"/> the place before him. Which also is a good warning to all in such case, to take heede, that they doe not so inordinately prease to the higher places with the iniury of others, as that thereby they occasion God, that most high and righteous Iudge, to right those that were wronged by them, euen to the depth of reproach to themselues. For that which befell vnto the people (that fine, as wee tearme it, that was imposed vppon them, of one hundred Talentes of Siluer and one Talent of Golde, to bee <note place="margin">2 King. 23: 35 2 Chr. 36. 3, 4</note> assessed by him whom they had reiected, but now was made King ouer them without any thankes vnto them) I know it is taken by some, as though it should bee a yearely <note place="margin">

                  <hi>Ioā. wolph. in</hi> 2 <hi>Reg.</hi> 23: 33-35</note> As also diuers thinges in the Text doe seeme to incline that way rather, as that he prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently deposed him whom they had set vp, and placed another whom they had refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed; and that this imposition is not tearmed by the ordinary name of a tribute, but a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> punnishment or condemnation, or as we tearme it, an amercement or fine, as impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed <note place="margin">2 Chr. 36: 3. <hi>Ari.

Which doing of his, so amending by aequity, that which they had done iniuriously before, may likewise be a warning to all peoples ensuing, that they doe not so iniuriously be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haue themselues towardes any (as many haue done and yet doe vnto the Ministery, so often as they entitle others vnto their needefull and lawfull maintenance) as that thereby they occasion God, to send in strangers to right thinges againe.

Which that we may the better perceiue, we are first to consider of the waies that he held: then, of the fruite he reaped thereby.

That which <hi>Ieremy</hi> dooth so specially charge him withall, is, that hee had but little regard to the word of GOD: <note place="margin">Ier. 22: 18, 21</note> and, that that had beene his manner from his youth vp.

<pb n="486" facs="tcp:7530:255"/> that, although in that outward manner they seemed much to seeke to the Lorde; yet by this fact of his so dealing with she-word of God, and with his Seruants, hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrayeth plainely, that so farre as hee ioyned with the rest in obseruing that fast, it was nothing else but Hypocrisie in him: and sure it is, that whether hee shewed any ill heart heereby, or not towards him to whō he professed allegeance, he out of doubt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> shewed an ill heart towards God. These being his waies, we may easily conceiue, that the fruit which he reaped thereby, was correspondent: and first in that he was enforced now to change his old Maister, and to betake himselfe to a new: then, in that greater euill that hee found, when hee dealt ill with that new Maister of his. When he was enforced to change, and to betake himselfe to that his new Maister, <note place="margin">2 King. 24: 1 Dan. 1: 1, 2</note> seeing it was done by forcible meanes (for the Citty was besiedged) we may easily conceiue, that besides the dishonour, he receiued much damage thereby: and it is plainely recorded, that then the King of <hi>Babylon</hi> tooke away part of the Plate of the House of the Lord (which they neglected now) and put the same in the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sury of his owne Idols.

Those also that were neerest vnto the King in blood or degree of honour, accustomed to be rulers themselues, and euer to bee attended by many, and all others besides, especially the chiefe and principall of them, the more nobly-minded they were, so much the more to their greater griefe must they now themselues yeeld if not to soule and intollerable abuse, yet at least to a yoake a great deale more grieuous to the nature of some▪ than many deathes.

But whereas nowe wee vnderstand of another sort of them gone downe into <hi>Aegipt,</hi> and that they are none of this company, it shall be good that first we consider of them: and then come to the Story of those that are gone to <hi>Babylon.</hi> In their Story that are gone into <hi>Aegipt,</hi> first it is good that we note the effect of the whole: then, that we consider of one particular more specially. The effect of the whole is, that they continued in <note place="margin">Ier. 43: 8-44: 30.</note> their wonted sinnes; and would in no wise bee by the Prophet reformed: and that God thereuppon, by that his Prophet denounced vnto them, that the King of <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi> should come thyther also, and that none of them should euer returne to theyr Land againe, but one way or other perrish there in the Land of <hi>Aegipt.</hi> That one particular which is good to bee marked besides, is, that they also had a Queene of <note place="margin">Ier▪ 7: 8. 44: 15-19.

            <p n="2">2 Hauing thus found, that they were onely those that went to <hi>Babylon,</hi> on <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> whom the Story hence-forward goeth, and beeing now to see what was their estate in that their subiection, wee are first to consider of their captiuity: then, in what case they afterward stood, vntill the comming of Iesus Christ. Their Captiuity was to reach out vnto the space of threescore and ten yeares, from the first beginning of it, vnto their deliuerance againe: which is by diuers diuersly reckoned, because there were captiues taken from <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> at diuers seueral and sundry times, as the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry it selfe declareth; but the oddes that is betwixt them, is not great, nor to the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the thing it selfe much materiall. As when the day doth first breake in the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> morning, or close vp at night, or in a Sunne-dyall the Sunne entereth into any houre, or doth first leaue it againe, it is hard for any, though neuer so attentiuely marking, so to set downe the very moment or instant of it, but that others attentiuely marking too, may be notwithstanding of other iudgement. As touching their Captiuity in <hi>Babylon,</hi> because it was finished by their deliuerance thence; therefore it shall not be amisse, that we couple these two together: first considering of their Captiuity it selfe; then of their deliuerance also. In their Captiuity it selfe we are to note two speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all thinges: one, that as it was meant a chasticement vnto them, so may we looke to finde it none other; the other, that neuerthelesse it pleased God, some-thing to mit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigate the same vnto them, by the comforts that he gaue them therein. That as it was meant as a chasticement vnto them, so it was indeede, wee haue it not set downe by any speciall Stories thereof (as, in what thinges they were hardly dealt with there) but left as plaine enough of it selfe: the <hi>Babyloniaus</hi> being now so mighty a people, and by their great successe being growne so insolent as they were, and as by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity of our common Nature all men are; and beeing besides so ignorant of the truth, and of the true worshippe of God, that the <hi>Iewes,</hi> who onely had the truth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, and by it were more odious to all Idolaters whatsoeuer, must needes be odious also to them. The comforts that he gaue them therein, were some of them vnder the King that now raigned ouer them: others, vnder those that followed. Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the King that now raigned ouer them, wee read of some comfortes that they had soone after they came thyther: and some againe in the time ensuing. Soone after they came thyther, the comfortes that were giuen them were, first by raising vp some of themselues to good place among them; then by abasing those that were their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. Those whom hee aduanced soone after they came thither, were, <hi>Daniell,</hi> and certaine others: first praeparing them vnto it, then bringing them to the aduancement it selfe. An order or course that is so much the rather to be of vs obserued, for that
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:7530:257"/> we euer couet to be aduanced, but care not to be enable vnto it before: that being <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> that pleaseth our humor well; but this beeing painefull, and therefore on all handes declined of vs. Praepared vnto it they were, first by the order that the King himselfe did take for them and others: but then much more, by the good course that these did more specially take. The order that the King tooke for them and others, was, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> that such youths of the Issue of Princes and Noble-men as now he had gotten toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">Dan. 1: 3-5</note> out of the Countries that he had subdued, so many of them as were likely and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, should haue an ordinary, like Noble mens Children, and bee instructed both in language of that Countrey, and in all such wisedome and learning as was meet to enable them, to be about the King himselfe, and to attend him: Among these there were foure that were taken out of <hi>Iury</hi> (whether there were, of this sort, any moe or <note place="margin">Ibid. 6, 7.</note> not, wee cannot tell) <hi>Daniell</hi> himselfe, and three others with him: who were <hi>Hana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niah, Misaell</hi> and <hi>Azariah;</hi> but then hauing these names changed, and others gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen them. The good purpose that they did more specially hold, is first attributed <note place="margin">Ibid. 8. Ibid. 10, 12</note> to <hi>Daniell</hi> onely; but then communicated to the others also: and so it may probably seeme, that it began of him; but then, that the others, being stirred vp by his example, did readily ioyne themselues vnto him. As we also find by experience sometimes, that the good example of one, doth lead on others: &amp; so may we learn, that euer it is good that some be doing; and more honorable it is, in goodnesse to be the beginners our selues, than followers of others. The purpose that they took, was, that they would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">Ibid. 8-16.</note> fare hardly, than (euen in that their captiuity) eat of such things as God by his law had forbidden vnto thē: which by the fauour that <hi>Daniel</hi> had with their keeper, soon after vpon some triall they obtained. Whereby it came to passe, that as the Kings de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire <note place="margin">Ibid 17-20</note> was to haue all those youths well instructed: so were those foure especially, and far exceeded al the residue therein; and <hi>Daniel</hi> besides, specially endued with the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding of visions and dreams. They being thus praepared, and the time now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing neer, that God would bring them to the aduancement it selfe, first he occasioneth the King to do it: then, the King accordingly doth it. He occasioneth the King to do it, first by bringing him into some speciall want of helpe: then, by <hi>Daniell,</hi> yeelding that help vnto him to his full eontentment. The want of helpe that he was in, was by <note place="margin">Dan. 2: 1-12</note> that his dreame which troubled him much, for that hee conceiued it to bee a matter of speciall importance: and yet neyther did vnderstand the meaning of it; neyther could hee call to his minde againe the Dreame it selfe. In the helpe that heerein it pleased God by <hi>Daniell</hi> to giue him, we are to consider of it, first as it was an help vnto him: then, as it is instruction to vs. As it was an helpe vnto him, first it is set downe generally: then, more specially. Generally, <hi>Daniell</hi> dooth tell him, that <note place="margin">Ibid. 13-45</note> whereas hee was reuoluing or casting in his minde, what shoulde bee after him: it pleased GOD, by that great Image to repraesent the same vnto him; it bearing a resemblaunce, both of that mighty State of his then, and of such as (for a good <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> time) should afterward follow. That which hee did impart vnto him more spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, was, eyther to shewe the manner of those States while they stood: or else as touching the abolishing of them. While they were to stand, he noteth two things: one, that they were terrible all; the other, that still they declined to bee baser and baser. And true it is, that all such Empyres lightly are greeuous to the people ouer <note place="margin">Ibid 31-43.</note> whom they are; and the longer they doe enioy them in peace, the more doe they euer growe vppon them, and euer deuise occasions to hauke them in, more and more: and that such as succeede in the roome of the former, as in time they fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe the others, so are they often the baser also. In that which hee speaketh more specially of the abolishing of those States, hee noteth two thinges: one, that they should bee abolished; the other, that it should bee by a mightier State than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of those. As it is instruction to vs, to our great comfort we may conceiue, that <note place="margin">Ibid, 44, 45</note> as those mighty earthly powers were abolished by the comming of Christ, when ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthelesse he came then but in great weaknesse, in comparison; so will all other such like, and the whole power of the World whatsoeuer, much rather giue place, as hauing no power at all to stand then, when hee shall againe come in power and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: and that the power and glory of the World beeing swallowed vp in the power
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:7530:258"/> and glory of the kingdome of Iesus Christ, so many as are in Christ haue no losse but gaine thereby. The King being thus far occasioned, was very greatly affected there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at, <note place="margin">Ibid. 46-49</note> and did much aduance not onely <hi>Daniell</hi> himselfe: but, at his request, those three fellowes also of his besides: not to be doubted, but to the speciall good comfort and helpe of all the residue of that Nation; but of those that were there already, and of those that shortly after were brought vnto them.</p>
            <p n="3">3 In the Story of those their enemies that were about this time abased, first wee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> haue the occasion thereof deliuered vnto vs: then, how they were thereon abased. In that which was the occasion of it, we haue some part of it plainely recorded: some other againe, that is but implyed. That which is plainly recorded, was the setting vp of that rich &amp; glorious Image: and, that so straight commandement was giuen, that <note place="margin">Dan. 3: 1-7</note> all sorts of people there, at once, should, at a signe giuen, al together fall downe and worship it. That which is not so plainly set downe, but yet may seeme to be plainely implied, is wherupon, or for what cause, this Image may seem to be erected: which may well seeme to be, in truth to ouerthrow the most of those that were now aduaunced; and yet as on a needfull pollicy on behalfe of the State. That their intent might well <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> be, to ouerthrow or vndermine the most of those that were so aduanced, it may seem, <note place="margin">Ibid. 8-12</note> because they did so readily accuse them; as conceiuing before, that because theyr Law did so plainely forbid the worshipping of Images, and these were men of so spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall reckoning for their regard vnto the Law, therefore they were likely enough to catch them hereby: and the experience of all ages teacheth, that great men that ly at receit of Courtly paeferments, can hardly brooke it that strangers should be praeferred before them; especially such as these, being of so base a reckoning as these were now with them, being in captiuity vnto the. That they did not then accuse <hi>Daniell</hi> too (for we may well hope, that he also did not worship, though in their accusation they make no mention of him) it may well be, that they did but that in pollicy onely: as fearing that his authority and credit was so great with the King, as that so they might haue marred all, if they had taken him in with the rest. Those that were abased heereby, were of two sorts also: some, of whom we haue such matter plainly recorded; others of whom it is againe but onely implyed. Those of whom wee haue such matter plainely recorded, are all the company generally: and one aboue others more special<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. All the company generally had no small abasing in this, that that their new and glorious God, and their worshipping of him, yea and that whole solemnity it selfe, was by those three Seruants of God so much crossed, yea and by God himselfe (in so miraculous defense of his Seruaunts) so plainely disgraced. More specially, the King himselfe, who now in this did make himselfe theyr Enemy too, and was accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly dealt withall for it: first while he persisted in that course wherein yet he was; then, in that he was forced in the end to yeeld. While hee persisted in the course wherein yet hee was, hee fustayned a kinde of abasing first in his owne person: then, in certaine to him appertayning. In his owne person hee was so farre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>based <note place="margin">Ibid. 13-18</note> based in it, that notwithstanding his greeuous expostulation with them for that they had not already worshipped, as hee had commaunded; and his second charge that now they should doe it, or other-wise incurre euen the vtter-most of his most grieuous displeasure: yet notwithstanding, for all his owne greatnesse, and that all the others did readily obey him generally, hee nothing at all praeuayled with any of them. Those that did appertaine vnto him, were of the most valiant in all his Army, and had the charge to bind them, and to cast them into that fiery Furnace which was for that purpose prouided: which when they accordingly did, they were slaine with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
               <note place="margin">Ibid. 19-23</note> the fire whereinto they did cast those others; and so, whether they were of his Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains or Souldiers, the King did leese them. But whereas these Seruants of God were not burnt, and had no hurt at all by the execution of that terryble sentence of the King against them, it so wrought with the King, that God had thus myraculously <note place="margin">Ibid. 24-30</note> deliuered those his Seruants, that he not onely now gaue glory to God, and made it death for any to speake any blasphemy against him, for that none other could so deliuer as hee now had doone: but now also, did specially aduaunce those whom
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:7530:258"/> hee had condemned before. In the time that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 span">

For in that the King himselfe was so abased, it is most likely, that such people as were in captiuity vnder him, had the more ease thereby: and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort withall to see how God reuenged their cause vpon him: and whereas God fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shewed that vnto him before, by a dreame that he sent him, and none could expound the same vnto him but <hi>Daniell</hi> onely, of all those peoples that were in captiuity none more likely than <hi>Dauiels</hi> people to haue such fauour as that would yeeld. Those other Kinges that followed, in this mighty State that now we speake of, during the time of their captiuity (such as are by vndoubted authority noted vnto vs) were two: <hi>Euilme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodak;</hi> and <hi>Baltasar: Euilmerodak</hi> succeeding Nebucadnezzar his Father, so soone <note place="margin">2 King. 25: 27. 30.

In <hi>Balthasars</hi> time we haue some, while yet he had longer time to gouerne: and one immediatly before he was to leese both his Kingdome and life together, Those that we haue while yet he had some longer time to gouern, are two: one, in the first; the other, in the third years of his raign. In the first year of his raign was that vision that <hi>Daniel</hi> had imparted to him, as touching the great troubles which <note place="margin">Dan. 7: 1-28</note> after their deliuerance out of captiuity should befall them, and he vppon them a long time after; and which <hi>Daniell</hi> did likewise declare to the people: by the which they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> were giuen to vnderstand, that when their Captiuity should be ended yet should not their afflictions and exercises thereupon cease; but then withall, both that such as did molest them should be remembred, and that a King or deliueret should be giuen vnto thē, who should be most mighty, and whose kingdom should endure for euer. In the <note place="margin">Dan. 8: 1-27</note> third yeare of it, was that other vision of the ouerthrow of the <hi>Persian</hi> state: &amp; how deeply the people of God should be exercised by the <hi>Gracian</hi> succeeding: especially, by an vngracious Imp in the latter part of it. And the comfort they had in this, was, that it pleased God so familiarly to deale with one of themselues: and that by him, both they were fore-warned of those their troubles; and were assured withall, that God would be auenged on those that should so trouble them. That one that went immediatly before he was to leese his kingdome &amp; life together, was that hand-wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <note place="margin">Dan. 5: 1-29</note> seene on the wall, that made the King and all his company astonied at it, euen in the midst of that great feasting of theirs, whereby the imminent ruine of that prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent State was denounced vnto them: and none but <hi>Daniel</hi> was able to expound that same vnto them; for which likewise he was then rewarded with speciall honor. Both which in all reason must make that little time of their captiuity much more easie vnto them, than otherwise it was likely to haue done.</p>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> raigne closing vp the time of the <hi>Babylonian</hi> State, and almost the full tearme of the seauenty yeares of their Captiuity, we are to consider, in what sort it pleased God to woorke their deliuerance, so that hauing accomplished the time of theyr Captiuity, they might returne to theyr Countrey againe. To that end it pleased God, first to make a way vnto it: then, to performe the thing it selfe. To make a way vnto it, hee would first abolish the State that then stood: and then set vppe another in steede thereof. The State that then stood, was that mighty State of <hi>Babylon,</hi> as wee haue seene already: and for it, wee may doe well to consider, not onely that it was remooued, but some pointes also of the manner of it. In that it was remoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, they hauing before made such hauocke of the people of God as they had, and yet holding them in subiection: wee also may haue good hope to see this <hi>Babylon</hi> of ours, which hath so imbrewed it selfe in the blood of Gods Seruaunts, and yet keepeth many of them Captiue still, in his good time to be remoued, that his people
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:7530:259"/> may againe returne; and not onely the maine body of it, but the seuerall armes and braunches withall, that, according to their power, doe yet keepe some of the people <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> of God in captiuity, as Princes their Subiects, Parents their Children, Maisters their Seruants, and Land-Lordes their Tenants.

In the manner of it wee may note, that they were surprized in the middest of their iollity: and, as they were prophanely abusing those holy vessels. And so the enemies of the Gospel may be in their iollitie, set vpon mischiefe, doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting no perrils, casting no dangers, but making merry, and accounting all their own sure enough: and yet euen then also haue their destruction to rush in vpon them, when they do least feare it; and when they haue accounted themselues the farthest from it. In that it came vpon them when they were profanely abusing those holy vessels, it may be a warning to so many of vs as yet with-hold such maintenance or liuings of the Ministerie, as by right are due vnto them, and both they and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple haue neede of, to Gods glory, and their owne soules health: that wee also are liable to the selfe-same iudgements; and that, if we haue them not nowe, there bee heauier that abide vs hereafter. That other that he did then set vp in steed of that which thus hee abolished, was of the <hi>Medes</hi> and the <hi>Persians:</hi> the <hi>Medes</hi> being of greater reckning before, but the <hi>Persians</hi> growing to be the mightier now; and at this time both concurring, or vniting themselues together. Who when they came <note place="margin">Isa. 13: 17 <hi>Mat. Beroald. Chr. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 6. <hi>pag.</hi> 145.</note> in place, did indeed (not long after) giue the people leaue to returne, and very good helpe thereunto besides; yet not in such sort, but that first there were some difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, of the people of God to be deuoured: hauing certaine storie of some that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fell vnto <hi>Daniell;</hi> and of others that it seemeth many of the people beside concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. Those that besell vnto <hi>Daniell,</hi> we finde to be two: one, his casting into the Lions den; the other, that their deliuerance came not so readily, but that hee was faine first to pray for it. That he was cast into the Den of Lions, is recorded be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that other of his praying, and allotted to the raigne of <hi>Darius:</hi> and so it may well be, that it was soone after the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Persians</hi> came to the kingdome; and that finding <hi>Daniell</hi> in speciall place then, and (it may bee) hearing of his woorth <note place="margin">Dan. 5: 29</note> before, the new King did now thinke good to vse him in such place of credit in his <note place="margin">Ibid. 6: 1-3</note> affaires also, and thought to aduance him farther too. Wherein it shall bee good <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> to mark, how it pleased God to deale with him, that so we may be better warned as touching our selues. It pleased God so to deale with him, that first hee brought him into great danger: and then did send him great deliuerance. He was brought into that danger, nothing at all of his owne default: but altogether by certaine o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. Himselfe held so good a course in all his waies, that when the great men of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Persians</hi> (belike on enuie of the great place the King had giuen him, especially, hee being but a stranger and a captiue among them) would gladly <note place="margin">Ibid. 4, 5, 10</note> haue found some fault with him, yet could they finde none at all in any of all his wayes whatsoeuer: so that they were faine to make their quarrell, and to ground their accusation vpon the exercise of his Religion, in that as it seemeth, they had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him diuers times, in his owne chamber, to make his supplications and prayers to God; as the godlier sort in all ages, as occasions are at any time offered, haue now and then vsed to doe. But vpon this ground they went to the King, and obtained <note place="margin">Ibid. 4-18</note> such a decree or law to be inacted by him, as vnwitting to the King might intangle the life of <hi>Daniell:</hi> and so stifly did vrge the execution of it when they had obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned it, that <hi>Daniell</hi> was cast in the den of the Lyons, though the King himselfe would faine haue deliuered him. As touching which one point, that the King would haue deliuered him if he might (which he might not do for that the Lawes of the <hi>Medes</hi> &amp; <hi>Persians</hi> were such, as that no decree confirmed by the King might
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:7530:259"/> be altered) it is good to note, that although it bee good and needfull for all states generally, that the Laws they haue made be well obserued: yet is it both good &amp; needfull likewise, that there be a power reserued to dispense therewith, so oft as the letter of the Lawe may intangle, such as the Law-makers did not meane, and are not within the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

That which out of it wee are to gather, is some part of it of that time praesent: but some part againe of the time ensuing. That which is of that time praesent, is, both that Princes (though other-wise good) are but seldome in such thinges so forward as were to be wished: and that for such thinges as God hath promised and meaneth to giue vs, neuerthelesse he dooth not make such hast therein, but that hee leaueth vs time to seeke to him for them, and occasioneth vs so to doe. That which is of the time ensuing, is out of the answer that <hi>Daniell</hi> had on that his praier: wherein though <note place="margin">Dan. 9: 20-27</note> he had certaine comforts giuen, yet both those comforts were not in so plain speeches deliuered vnto him, but that it was some-what hard▪ to vnderstand them (and so are they yet, euen to these dayes also;) and hee might (euen at the first sight) see, that much more trouble did yet abide them. Belike, a resolued course with God, for all his people; euer, in this Worlde, to bee vnder the crosse, that so hee may doe them the more good in the Worlde to come: and that it may neuer (lightly) bee sufficient for the Children, that their Fathers had suffered much; but that, as they also were his people, one way or other they should drink of the same cup, that so they might be partakers with them in glory. For therein we may plainely and vndoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly see (and yet not entering into any particulars of it, but leauing them to others, that haue better helpes, to be by them decided, as indeede there is great variety of mens iudgementes therein) that now this people, for whom <hi>Daniell</hi> was so carefull to haue them restored home againe, were not any long time after to stand or to bee a people: but that whatsoeuer promises they had of GOD, to themselues and theyr State, theyr promises and praerogatiues, were now very shortly all at an ende. In Queene <hi>Maries</hi> time, when Images came in requaest againe, and a Caruer was busily occupyed in repayring some that in King <hi>Edwardes</hi> time had beene some-what defaced, as making new Noses to such as had their former strucken off <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> before, one espying how he was occupyed (one, that her selfe detested Idolatry, and <note place="margin">The wife of one Prest.

The matter that now we haue in hand is of much grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter importance: but that taunt of the woman, may some-thing open a readier way to the vnderstanding of this matter also. For <hi>Daniell,</hi> wee may plainely see, by the ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestnesse of his prayer, that hee was very carefull for them, and by the occasion hee tooke vnto it, that it was for that distressed people, and for the desolation of the Citty that had so notable promises, and neuerthelesse was so desolate nowe; wishing now returne to the people, and the building againe of <hi>Hierusalem:</hi> and so goeth it directly vnto the matter, that GOD dooth giue him to vnderstand, that the people and Citty for whom hee was so carefull, were not such as hee s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 span">

To which ende also it is not amisse to marke, that it is not deliuered vnto him, as to goe and wame the people thereof, least those heauy iudgements come vpon them: but a thing already deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined and impatred to him as a secret, and for the speciall fauour that God did beare him. The order the Angel obserueth therein, is first that he doth it but generally: only shewing, that then there was but a short time wherein God would dispatch whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer <note place="margin">Ibid. 23. Ibid. 24.</note> he had to do with them, &amp; not seeming to talke of years but of weekes, so to note the time to be short, but yet that God would afford them the time that he spake of in very good measure. Then more specially, that although they now returned, yet <note place="margin">Ibid 25.</note> would it bee long before they should attaine to haue any good estate among them: and that when they had attayned thereto, yet shoulde they haue many troubles <note place="margin">Ibid. 26.</note> withall; and when it had so stood but a short time to speake of, then should it sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainely, and, as it were, in a moment rush downe at once, neuer to bee set vp or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired <note place="margin">Ibid. 27.</note> againe. That there were other difficulties also, which it seemeth, were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued of the people, may probably bee gathered, for that by the Story of <hi>Ester</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, where we haue mention of so many of the <hi>Iewes</hi> there remayning still, when neuerthelesse they had free leaue to returne: they belike seeing some reason to moue them, not to be so forward yet, and thereupon staying behinde as they did. It may well be, and is most likely, that for most of them it was no more but worldly respects that did so stay them: but it may likewise be, for many of them, that they saw (as they thought) iust cause to doubt, that it was no wisedome yet to be doing.</p>
            <p n="5">5 To performe the thing it selfe vnto them, it pleased him so to worke in the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> heartes of those to whom it appertayned, that soone after it was effected. Those to whom it appertained, were first those that were in <hi>Babylon,</hi> to whom as yet they were in subiection: then the <hi>Iewes</hi> or people of God that were now to be deliuered. Those that were in <hi>Babylon,</hi> to whom the people were yet in subiection, were first (as their Story in this, doth occasion vs to consider) King <hi>Cyrus</hi> himselfe: then, certain of his people besides. Betwixt these the matter proceeded, as it were by two de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees: and so are we to consider what was done, first in the former; then also, in the latter of them. In the former of them King <hi>Cyrus</hi> himselfe, soone after that hee <note place="margin">2 Chr. 36: 22, 23. Ezr. 1: 1-4. 2 Esdr. 2: 1-7</note> came to the Crowne, by open Proclamation first acknowledging the goodnesse of God towardes him, and the charge that hee had giuen him to build him an House in <hi>Hierusalem:</hi> both giueth free liberty to the <hi>Iewes</hi> to returne (so many as would) there to build the House of the Lorde; and besides willeth his owne people among whom they dwelt, to be helping vnto them. That which heereuppon was done by the people of God, was, that the chiefe Fathers, and the Priestes and Leuites, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">Ezr. 1: 5. 1 Esdr. 2: 8</note> with all such of the people, as whose spirite God had mooued thereunto, assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled themselues together to make theyr returne, according to the licence or leaue that now was giuen them. This mercy hath God in this praesent age, vouchsafed likewise to many of vs, that we may return (to the free professiō of the truth in Christ) againe if we will: and so ought wee to addresse our selues againe to returne: as also those doe, in some kinde of measure, to whom it hath pleased GOD to vouchsafe them such mercy, as effectually to mooue their hearts vnto it. In the latter of them
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:7530:260"/> we may see the readynesse of the <hi>Iewes</hi> heerein to be well required, and encouraged withall to proceede: first by the people among whom they dwelt; then also, by king <hi>Cyrus</hi> himselfe. The people among whom they dwelt, bestowed liberally vppon <note place="margin">Ezr 1: 6 1 Esdr. 2: 9</note> them towardes their iourney: and, as it seemeth, sent with them besides; a free-will offering, towardes the woorke that they had in hand, the rearing vp of that Temple to God. A speciall good token of the fauour and goodnesse of God towards them, that so did frame the hearts of their enemies, to bee helping so well to themselues and their businesse: whereas wee are but seldome able, to obtaine the like of out friendes, that are of the same profession with vs. King <hi>Cyrus</hi> himselfe did likewise bring forth and deliuer vnto them, all the rich Plate at the Temple of God at <hi>Hieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ezr. 1: 9-11 1 Esd 2: 10-15</note> which <hi>Nebucadnezzer</hi> had taken thence long before, which hee also and the other Kings that followed had hitherto kept and vsed as their owne; euen fiue thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and foure hundred parcels of them (wee haue else-where set downe threescore <note place="margin">1 Esdr 2: 14. 1 King 3: 13. 7▪ 48. 50. 2 King 25: 15, 16.</note> and nine moe) massie and faire, beeing such, we may conceiue, so nere as they could, as <hi>Salomon</hi> had made to the vse of the Temple, and he made them in his great abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, in the glory, and to the glory of that great and glorious Kingdome of his) and all of them eyther of Gold or of Siluer. Which Story is, as it seemeth to me, of very rare and speciall note, first if wee looke no farther but onely vnto <hi>Cyrus</hi> therein: but then especially, if in it we cast our eyes vnto God. If wee looke but vnto <hi>Cyrus</hi> therein, soone may we finde, that as he was but a naturall man, hee might easily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, that as the case now stood with him, hee had more reason still to keepe them, than so to part with them. For himselfe neuer tooke them thence; but one of his praedecessors long before: and he might easily come to the knowledge of this, that for the sinne of the people God had giuen them, and all that they had into his hands; <note place="margin">Ier. 20: 4, 5. 27: 1-7. 40: 2, 3</note> so that hee was but Gods executioner therein, and that in duty hee was to doe him that seruice, and might lawfully take, to his owne vse, all the spoile of them. Being also so rich a booty as they were, so faire an ornament vnto his State, and so needfull an helpe (if neede should bee) to further his warres, there was sufficient ground or warrant, for a naturall man, still to haue kept them: and no way at all, to escape the note of vnaduised dealing, withall his States-men that were about him, so easily to part with such a booty, so arising or comming as that did to him. Againe, if him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe were disposed there-with to furnish the Temple of God at <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> yet what neede he to bee so forward when yet there was no Temple builded, nor yet in building: and, though it were builded, and the same very stately too, and were mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent; yet that euen the best wisedome of naturall men, and such as are but meere Politicians, might easily resolue, that halfe of those parcels, or a much lesse part, might easily serue them. Whereunto, if such as might seeme to haue a care of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and of the aduancement of it, as much as any, shoulde put in their vie, that Religion needed not those earthly ornaments, and that they might make the teachers of it to forget themselus, or to degenerate, in what perplexity might we conceiue this King would haue beene, if hee had beene any thing doubtfull before? But hee was resolute, and heroicall too: and accordingly carryed himselfe in all that action. God, indeede, had made him great; and that he confesseth: but wee vnderstand of no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther charge that he had for this matter (at least, that himselfe doth take with) but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that he was to build him a Temple in <hi>Hierusalem.</hi> So it may be, he needed not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> at all to goe any farther: and seeing there was not such vse of those thinges yet, hee had no great cause so soone to haue sent them. If in it we cast our eyes vnto God, <note place="margin">2 Chr. 36: 1. Ezr. 1: 1▪ Esdr. 2: 2. Esa. 44: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

When the Spirite of God doth in such case mooue any of vs, then be we sure, that all such thinges must euer bee carried in more honourable manner, and much more agreeably to the rule of aequity, than otherwise our selues should thinke
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:7530:261"/> that we needed to doe. Our selues haue had, and yet haue, in this our age ours, a case much like.

The sinnes of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple had (no doubt) so first deserued: and so did God in his iust iudgements, then giue them to others. But when those houses had filled the measure of their sinne also, then did God strengthen the lawfull Magistrate, of long time vnable to deale with them before, to looke into their doinges, and to with-draw from them againe, what God was content they enioyed before, and to that time held▪ to the iust chasticement of vs his people▪ and they; according as God hath enabled them, haue with-drawn those thinges from them indeede.

In this Realme of ours it pleased God to raise vp a notable <hi>Cyrus</hi> for the first part of it with great power, and terrour to them all, hee wrested them out of the handes of those <hi>Babylonians</hi> of ours; but then, the Nobility and Commons thinking good to bestow them on him, to the vse of the whole, he also thought good so to take them. Wherein if in his own conscience he had found he had done amisse, or at least not so well as he might haue done, to the glory of God &amp; good of the people, he had time enough after to haue bettered his course therein. His son succeeded; but vnder age: yet in those tender years of singular hope. But those that sat at the sterne then, seemed to haue taken (for diuers of thē) such sweetnes in those they had gotten before, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> they seemed rather to cast in their heads how to get mo, than how to returne those againe that once they had gotten. This held but a while; God himselfe soone taking away the ground that they stood on, when they did make it so to serue them: and it may be, that euen it was as great a cause as any other, that so soone we lost so great a comfort. Of that line we had another then next following, who made to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes it maruelous well; elder in yeares, but latter by sex: such a Princesse, as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting but two things onely, all true subiects might to their comfort haue well en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyed. But euen in those also she might be held somewhat excused: being, as she was, brought vp in the one; and neere allied vnto the other. But for the matter we speake of, shee readily gaue so good an example in her kinde, that I know not yet to be matched by any, and may prooue to to be a condemnation to many. Since that wee had another of the same, a very rare Iewell indeede, whom also it pleased God to blesse (for aboue his endowments of her, though those also were very great) with long continuance and great successe: but then were wee so farre from going forward with that good worke to our hands begun, that euen then it was brought cleane backe againe; and a way left open to many (that would) to proceede far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther therein, so oft as such opportunity should bee offered, as themselues thought good to worke by.

            <p n="6">6 That which the <hi>Iewes</hi> heereupon did, was, that as before they were setting <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> in hand with their iourney: so now, being better holpen and encouraged vnto it, than in likelihood might be expected, they do more readily betake themselues vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it. And so they returned, to the number of two and forty thousand, three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and threescore persons: then also hauing among them, of men-seruants and <note place="margin">Ezr. 2: 1-64 1 Esdr. 5: 7-41 Ezr. 2: 65 1 Esdr. 5: 42</note> maid-seruants, seauen thousand, three hundred, thirty and seauen. At which time it seemeth they brought cattle with them also to stocke their grounds, both great <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and small, because the King had willed his people to help them with cattle; and we
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:7530:261"/> read that the people so did: but we haue no Story but of such as were for burthen. But of such sortes we read, that they had Horses, seauen hundred, sixe and thirty; <note place="margin">Ezr. 2: 66, 67 1 Esdr. 5: 43</note> Mules, two hundred forty fiue; Camels, foure hundred, thirty and fiue; Asses, sixe thousand, seauen hundred and twenty. There is in these places of <hi>Esdras</hi> allead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged some little oddes in the numbers recited: but these are to be ouer-ruled by the other. As for the other, that <hi>Darius</hi> sent those forces with them to safe conduct <note place="margin">1 Esdr. 5: 1-3</note> them home, and sent them in so fauorable &amp; comfortable manner with instruments of Musicke, not as captiues, but as beloued and speciall friends, as vnto a wedding because there is nothing against it, &amp; is not (in the nature of it) a thing vnlikely, we may probably conceiue, that so it might be indeed. But sure it is, that their tearme being now expired, <hi>Babylon</hi> was no longer-able to keepe them: they might with good will part with them, as cheap as with ill. Part with them they must, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they would or not. And then as <hi>Laban</hi> at least praetended, that he would haue <note place="margin">Gen. 31. 27</note> sent <hi>Iacob</hi> home with melody also, had hee made him priuy to his departure: so it may bee that these now did, when they sawe they could keepe them no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. Which if wee marke wee may finde to bee verryfied in these dayes also: first, in that that nowe they returned, very plainely; then partly likewise, in that manner of it. For as it could not be withstood then, but that they returned, when the time was come that God had appointed: so doe we see it now in these dayes of the Gospell, that whereas wee haue long beene in captiuity vnder the power of darknesse, spreading it selfe vppon vs, from the corrupt and decayed estate of the Church of Rome, not seauenty yeares onely, but euen seauenty times seuen yeares, and those in iust and full measure (for, for the space of fiue hundred yeares, now not long since accomplished, they haue in a manner taken their pleasure all Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome ouer, though neuerthelesse at no time to speake of, at least in no age with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our resistance) our returne vnto the truth of the Gospell againe is already begun, and dayly enlarged, yea and comfortably aduaunced too. <hi>Daniell</hi> and his three <note place="margin">Dan. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

But now, when the appointed time was come, it was not those mighty Monarks of <hi>Babilon,</hi> that were able to keep them; nor able so much as to help themselues neither: they were from heauen proclaimed before, to be but grasse, and the glory of them, to be <note place="margin">Isa. 40: 6-8</note> but as the flower of the field; and no more able, in all their power, in that day to stand, that God in his secret purpose appointed for them, than the flower against a sharp nipping winde. Wee also haue had, all Christendome ouer, at times, here and there, and namely in this land of ours, many notable Princes, godly and great learned men, who a man might thinke, had been able, long before this to haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered themselues and their people, from that Babilonish captiuity of theirs wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they were; as also attempts sometimes haue beene made: but the time was not then come, and so they could not; and so were they faine to lye downe againe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Altar, and patiently to await, till the number of their brethren were accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished <note place="margin">Reuel. 6: 9-11</note> with them. In these dayes of ours, God hath so well begun our deliuerance already, that thereby we may probably conceiue, that now hee doth meane to goe forward with it, and not to breake of till he haue done it.

In the Reuelation it is plaine (besides many things else concurting therewith) that the illuminating or lightning of the earth go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">Apoc. 18: 1, 2</note> before, the vtter ruin or fall of <hi>Babylon</hi> followeth immediately after. Which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> course also seeing himselfe hath hitherto held, we may well hope, that he will not va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry now. When hee did set in hand with the deliuerance of his people out of their bondage in <hi>Egypt,</hi> after that once he began to do it, and did not leaue of till hee had done it. <hi>Moses</hi> did seeme to make towardes it before, conceiuing his bretheren <note place="margin">Exod. 2: 11 Act. 7: 23-26</note> would haue vnderstoode, that God by his handes would giue them deliuerance; and thereupon (it seemeth) left the Court, and offered himselfe so farre to his bretheren as then he did: but God would not that way do it, nor at that time neyther; and so it did not prosper with him. The <hi>Egyptians</hi> also, when once they were gone, and before they got out of their Dominions, when as likewise (as the case stoode then) it seemed to bee a most easie matter to get them againe, made after them a-pace with maine force, and endeuoured the best that they could, to bring them backe vnto their former bondage: but they had had their time of them before, and they had vsed them then as themselues thought good; and neuer might they looke to haue them againe. Themselues they might ouerthrow in the Sea; and so they did: but they must bid the people of God a due for euer. The <hi>Babylonians</hi> did not vse (that wee reade of) so hard measure towards their captiues the <hi>Iewes:</hi> but God indeede changed the suit, and set others in their roomes.

            <p n="1">1 <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N what case they afterwarde stoode vntill the comming of Iesus Christ, being now to be seene, it shall be good not onely to search <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> out what that estate of theirs was: but also to enter into some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration withall, how to resolue our selues, as touching certaine doubts which out of the same may arise vnto vs. Searching out, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> what that estate of theirs was, it shall be good likewise, that heere againe wee consider, first but generally thereof: then, that wee come more specially vnto it. Generally it is no more but this, that still they were in subiection to others. For though now they were sent home from <hi>Babylon,</hi> yet were they still to bee in subiection to those that did deliuer them from thence: and so, to pay them tribute; and to hold their allegeance to them. When afterward also it pleased God to pull downe any of those States that for a time bare sway in the world, and to set vp others in their roome, then were they also to atturne (as it were) vnto them, and to bee in allegeance to them. So, this people of God themselues, albeit they had that praerogatiue, that they were the onely people of God: yet neuer were they vouchsafed that earthly fauour (in all this time that now we speake of) that they
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:7530:262"/> should grow to be a mighty State ouer others (as diuers there were, in this time that now we are in) but that others should haue that preheminence, and these should be in subiection vnto them. So may we be the people and children of God; and so out of quaestion, very deare vnto him: and yet neuer bee vouchsafed such earthly fauour, as others are. Which consideration some-times hath sitten so hard to diuers, that they haue beene much dismaied at it: for which cause it is so much more needfull that it be we well digested of vs; least we also thereupon doubt of his fauour towards vs. God meaning those that are his indeede, much better things than are these matters heere, he therefore bestoweth these vpon others, but euer reserueth the better things to those that are his. Highnesse of minde, such as ariseth from the corruption of our nature, is that which maketh vs so to prease vnto praeheminence: but that is to bee abased and humility to bee planted in steede thereof. Another highnesse of minde there is, vnfainedly ioyned to humility heere, which descending from aboue, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth small reckoning of those thinges that are beneath: and so teacheth those with whom it lodgeth, not much to care in how meane estate they are heere; but to set their most affections on those better things that are promised there.</p>
            <p n="2">2 More specially it seemeth needfull heere, that first we consider, somewhat of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> the compasse of time that this Story dooth lie in: then, of the estate of the people therein. The compasse of time that this Story doth lie in, is not so plainly set down in the Text, but that the learned doe yet vary about it: and it would aske a speciall Treatice, to beat out the likelier opinion of them. Which because the course that now we are in, doth not allow, therefore it shall be to our purpose sufficient, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> to consider of the Story, and of such time as we noted therein: especially seeing we make no quaestion, but that so much onely is sufficient for vs, as it hath pleased God to leaue vs. As touching the estate of the people therein, wee finde, that for the most part of that time, we haue it set downe by the word of God, and in the way of History, as for other matters besides: but, for the residue of it, but by the way of Prophecy, and the same very briefly too. While we haue it set by the way of Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, whereas but part of the people now returned, and many of them yet tarried be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, we haue some Story of both sortes of them: first of those that now returned; then, of those that yet tarried behind. As touching those that now returned, their Story first noteth in what estate or case they were generally: then doth it deliuer vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs, one speciall imployment of theirs besides. Generally no more but this, that they had vnder them both the freedome of their Religion and Lawes; and a Deputy or Gouernour, one of themselues: but yet that they were in subiection vnto them, and did pay them tribute withall. That one speciall imployment of theirs, was the reedifying or building againe of the House of God. In the Story of which we haue deliuered vnto vs, first how themselues were occupied about it: then, how it pleased God, in the end to finish it. Themselues were so occupied about it, that they did for a time maruelous well; but nothing so commendable, a little after. For, when first they came home, we reade of diuers thinges very well done, both of certaine of the chiefe among them: and of all the whole company too. Certaine of the chiefe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them gaue towards the building of the House of God, of their owne accord, <note place="margin">Ezr. 2: 68-70 1 Esdr. 5: 44, 45.</note> threescore and one thousand drams of Gold, fiue thousand peeces of Siluer, and an hundred Garments for the Priestes to vse in their ministration: the summe of which Gold and Siluer that so they did so willingly giue, being accounted, in our Coine, to <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Bibl. angl</hi> 1594</note> amount to somewhat aboue fourscore and fourteene thousand, foure hundred four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score and thirteene pounds; a notable contribution, if wee marke, in respect of those that gaue it. For they were but newly come out of captiuity: and men are not wont to let those that are of that sort, to grow to any speciall wealth among them: and whereas they were, besides their seruants, but a few aboue two and fourty thousand, this came to aboue forty shillings a peece, one with another. An example to bee marked of vs so much the more, for that it seemeth it would be hard to match it with any such liberality of the greater sort among vs: though we also haue now these ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny yeares had in hand the building vp of Gods House among vs againe. Many of
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:7530:263"/> the greater sort among vs, it may be, we might finde, and too too many of the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> too, who one way or other haue possessed themselues of many of those thinges that should goe to the setting vp of the house of God among vs, or at least were needfull for it: but for any such liberality wee are so defectiue, that it may bee very wel doubted, we haue no great meaning to get vp that building. Of all the whole company of them there are good things noted likewise, both of their present de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion towards God: and of the care they had too, of the businesse or worke they had in hand. As touching their present deuotion then towards God, it is noted, <note place="margin">Ezr. 3: 1-6. 1 Esdr. 5: 47-53</note> that against the seauenth month the first of their festiuall times, it seemeth, they had, after that now they were returned, they all came together to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> made ready the Altar, offered thereon in very good mannner, and kept withall the feast of Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacles according as by the law was appointed: and though it seemeth it was the feare of the people among whome they were, that much quickned vp their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion <note place="margin">Ezr. 3: 3.</note> nowe; yet seemeth it likewise, that with good courage they did performe <note place="margin">1 Esdr. 5: 50</note> it, though the people of the Countrey did seeke to trouble them much therein. As touching the businesse they had in hand, then also they gaue money, and made pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uision, <note place="margin">Ezr. 3: 7. 1 Esdr. 5▪ 54, 55</note> that so they might set in hand with the worke so soone as might be: and in the second month of the next yeare, they began the worke it selfe, laying the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation <note place="margin">Ezr. 3: 8-11 1 Esdr. 5: 56-62.</note> and building thereon; ioyning withall, in very good manner, giuing of thanks and praises to God. At which time there fell out among them an accident very strange, till it be seen what reason it had. For when they had laid the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and reared vp some building theron, as it was a ioyful sight to most of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, <note place="margin">Ezr. 3: 12, 13 1 Esdr. 5: 63-65.</note> who shouted so for the ioy they conceiued, that farre off it was heard: so was it likewise so sorrowfull a sight to diuers of the company, such as were of the most ancient of them, who had seene the former Temple, out-liued the Captiuity, and were now come home againe, that they wept a-pace for sorrow, to see that this was neuer like to come neere to the former; and the cry of these (many of the others no doubt now ioyning with them, for the reuerence of their yeares and place among them) was likewise so great, that it could not bee discerned, whether the noyse of their mirth, or sorrow were greater. Wee also haue had many yeares nowe, the house of God rearing vp among vs: but so very vnlikely euer to come to that beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that were to be wished, for that the maintenance thereof is so strongly with-held by many; and that which remaineth, so hauked in still more and more, that although <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> many reioice for that which is already done (and good cause haue we, God be than<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, so to doe) yet many of the godlier and wiser sort, who see well inough that this kinde of building will neuer growe to any such beauty, as great reason it were it should, and can rightly decipher whereunto such glorious shewes as sometimes we haue doe closely tend, do heartily sorrow, to see it so intangled in a kinde of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall necessity, that they can neuer look to see it out of the briers. But God be than<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, that whether wee reioice for that which is already done, or whether wee sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row for that which wanteth and is like to want still, all is on behalfe of the Church of God. For we haue certaine others among vs, that haue herein no sorrow at al, but to see the house of God aduanced among vs so much as it is: nor any ioy, but to see it rise vp so slowly as it doth, &amp; not likely neither to make better speed. That they did nothing so commendably a little after, was that they grew cold and slacke in this their businesse: which notwithstanding we doe not finde in the story, in that compasse of time that now we are in, namely, soone after they were returned; but yet are assured that so it was, because the Prophet <hi>Agg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

The occasion they had, that they went not forwarde with the building that they beganne, was for the fore-part of the time but easie: but stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger after. While the occasion was but easie, neuerthelesse it seemeth, they suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered themselues to bee very long hindered thereby, euen threescore and tenne yeares, or thereabout. For as yet I see not the time so cleered by the Learned
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:7530:263"/> themselues, that wee may safely set downe the certainty of it: as neyther the Text it selfe doth tell vs (as a matter belike that the wisedome of God did not thinke so needefull for vs) what time it was that they left <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 word">

When they were but easily hindred we are again to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, first what the same hinderance was: then, what vse the <hi>Iewes</hi> made of it vnto themselues. The hindrance that they had, was by certain neighbors of theirs neere <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> vnto them, those mungrel<hi>-Israelites</hi> that we spake of before: the people that <hi>Salma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasor</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 kin. 17: 6, 24</note> brought out of his own countries, and placed in the citties of <hi>Israel;</hi> taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way those that were left of the <hi>Israelites</hi> in deed, and placing those in certain citties of his. These, as we heard had the hand of God in such sort vpon them at their first inhabiting there, that thereby they were brought to the feare and worship of the Lord: but yet not so fully not so sincerely, but that they worshipped then wonted Idols withall. The businesse that these did make to the <hi>Iewes,</hi> was first as friends: but then, as enemies. As friends, they came vnto them offering themselues to help to build with them, as being of the same profession for Religion that the <hi>Iewes</hi> were <note place="margin">Ezr 4: 1, 2 1 Esdr. 5: 66-69.</note> of: themselues belike seeing no ods, but that seeing they woorshipped after a sort the Lord too, their profession was as good as the profession of the others, though they woorshipped their wonted Idols besides. And wee haue diuers such among vs also, professing Christianity, but mingling their Idol-woorshipping withall (though, it may be, not altogether in so a high degree as those others, and yet in effect not farre of from them) who neuerthelesse themselues will not seeme to see but that they are as good Christians as any, yea and the onely Catholiques all Christendome ouer. But the people of GOD were wise enough, for them, and so gaue them their aunswere accordingly: namely, that they had nothing to doe <note place="margin">Ezr. 4: 3. 1 Esdr 5: 70, 71.</note> in that businesse, but that it was to them the <hi>Iewes</hi> onely committed; and so that themselues onely woulde accordingly doe it. Apoynte of wisedome and reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute dealing that hath beene long ouer-much wanting with vs, allowing those mungrell-Christians of ours to beare ouer-great sway in the Common-wealth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong vs, beeing now as it is so woorthy a member of the house or Church of God. For woe woorth the building, that they would haue builded: it would soone haue beene seene, what kinde of building theirs would haue beene. For so are wee sure, by playne experience, that ours haue doone. Beeing once allowed to beare any sway, in Court or Countrey, on Bench, or at Barre, the trueth of the Gospell, and the better professors of it, were euer sure, if they came in their way, to haue the shrewdest nip that they could giue them. God euer keepe them from the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell-Table: it is not to say, how wonderfull much mis-chiefe they might doe there. When these good Catholiques sawe themselues so plainely deciphered, and could not that way attaine to any part of their desire, then did they not sticke to shewe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> themselues as thty were indeed, themselues pulling of their visards then, and shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themselues to be plaine enemies, that seemed to be such frends before: and that which they did, first by themselues; then also, by others. By themselues, they so terrified and discouraged the builders, and so troubled them in their businesse, that <note place="margin">Ezr. 4: 4. 1 Esdr. 5: 72</note> the building of the Temple was thereby very much hindered. As we also haue seen by our companions of that rank, that when they might not themselues haue bin fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gering as they thought good, then would they be so troblesome vnto them one way or other, and cast in their way such terrors withall, as that thereby our building also hath thriued but ill, in comparison of that which otherwise it might haue done. By others they did it, first by hiering Counsellours against them: then, by seeking to <note place="margin">Ezr. 4: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> weigh the King himselfe to their bent also. That they hired Counsellors against them, it was that they should bee a meanes to hinder the building: themselues be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:7530:264"/> seeing, that they did hinder it nothing so much, as their good Catholique hearts desired; and therefore seeking vnto those others, that (they knewe well enough) could giue it a deadlyer gripe than they. And let Princes haue any such about them, wee neede not to doubt, but that our Catholiques too, will bee sure to wage them: and the Gospell may beshrewe theyr vnhappy Pates, that haue spyed that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage so much as they haue. To weigh the King to theyr bent also, it seemeth, that first themselues did write: then, that they got the Gouernours of those partes to doe the like. For first it is sayde, that themselues wrote an accusation against the Inhabitants of <hi>Iudah,</hi> and of <hi>Hierusalem:</hi> then it followeth immediatly after, that the Gouernours of those partes did also write against them. Of that which is attributed vnto themselues, wee haue no more sayde, but onely that they wrote to the King against them: but the other is set downe at large; and is indeede a gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous letter against them.

            <p n="3">3 The <hi>Iewes,</hi> beeing thus farre occasioned, did now giue ouer (wee may may easily conceiue) at least for a time, theyr building there. But if wee marke, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> we reade of no inhibition till now; and this seemeth to bee much longer since they returned, than dyuers doe take it: and then had they time enough, to haue finished their woorke long before this. Whereas therefore the Prophet dooth charge them, that they had lingered in their businesse; and for that cause it was, that God <note place="margin">Ag. 1: 1-4 Ibid. 5-11.</note> had sent him a Famine among them: hence wee are very probably directed to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that first they hadde a long time lingered; then, that they were forbidden be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides. Which is so much the rather to be considered, that we charge them no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than iustly we may. So it seemeth, that that charge of the Prophet after, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertayneth but onely to that time, when as yet they were not by Soueraigne autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity forbidden to builde: and that then it was, that they so busily went about theyr owne priuate; and accounted it no time as yet, to build on forward the house of the Lord. A matter, so much the rather to be considered, first, for the better auoiding of one peece of danger that is in our way heere: then for certaine other generall doctrines besides.

Indeede it followeth immediatly after, that a couple of Prophets did encourage them to bee doing: and that accordingly they did then set in hand with theyr businesse againe. But that is another Chapter, <note place="margin">Ezr. 5: 1, 2.</note> though next to it ensuing, and so not necessary to be vnderstood of the time that is spoken of in the Chapter before; as also we haue in the Text it selfe diuers good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons that doe other-wise direct vs to take it: both in these two Chapters that nowe we are in; and in the Story of those Prophets themselues that are spoken of heere. In these two Chapters that now we are in wee haue two reasons, one, arising out of them both: the other, in the latter of them. That which ariseth out of them both, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> is, that neyther wee haue the same King, nor those Gouernours in the one that we haue in the other: as by conferring them together dooth plainely appeare. If <note place="margin">Ezr. 4: 6, 7, 11, 23.

That which ariseth out of the latter of them, is, that the time <note place="margin">Ezr. 4: 6. 7. 5: 3, 5, 7</note> when those Prophetes did encourage them to bee doing, and they thereuppon did returne vnto it againe, was the same, when <hi>Tatnay</hi> and his Fellowes came to quaestion with them about it to informe the King, which was <hi>Darius,</hi> and not <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hash<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Which consideration of the variety of times and the raigne of those Princes, might easily haue shewed, that such a note there could neuer seeme to haue any sufficient warrantice for it. But some, not other-wise euill, were then also, (it may seeme) so possessed with that opinion, that people were so much to regard the Presbyteries, that in such thinges the Regall eminen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy was to yeelde vnto it, that euen that point of praeiudyce onely, might make them the rather stumble at this: and so made themselues some-what bolde, in such sort to lay downe that note, as if men neede not feare to take that from the one, and to giue it vnto the other. A point so per<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>lous, that it might not in duty bee omitted, but that others were to bee warned of it. Those other generall doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines besides, that arise out of this, are two: one, appertaining to all; the other, to the greater sort chiefely. That which dooth appertaine to all, is of two prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall branches: one, the notice of a speciall point of infirmity in vs; the other, a course that God in such case, may be doubted, will take. That speciall point of infirmity in vs that hence we may learne, is, how easily we slip (if wee take not the better heede) our greater businesse, in respect of some lesse: and not onely such as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> are but of ordinary or common temper therein; but euen of the better sort too. For this people, when first they returned, did maruellous well: with great deuotion they first worshipped God; and then for that their peculiar businesse, they liberally made prouision for it, and readily set in hand with the woorke it selfe. And yet soone after wee finde they were very slacke therein: and (it seemeth) a long time too. If a people for that time so forwarde and zealous, could neuerthelesse so soone fall off from it againe, a great deale more are many of vs in danger of it. If wee inquire what it was that hindered them, wee doe not finde them other-wise charged, but with that vnseasonable regard of their owne priuate: but that dooth imply withall, that they had but a slender regard of the publique; for that a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall regard, both of the one and of the other, doe neuer in any (or but very sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome) inhabit together. This may wee easily see in all publique good thinges whatsoeuer: but especially, as this case was, whensoeuer the house of God decay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is to bee reared vp among vs againe. For then (say wee) the time serueth not yet, that so we may with better colour goe about our priuate. Since the time it pleased God to vouchsafe vs the Gospell, wee had plaine experience of it: then, beeing brought home againe from the Captiuity wherein wee were; and, for a while, at the first beginning well. But then our proceedings (sauing that still we vpheld, what wee had done at the first (were nothing so answerable to that begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning as were to be wished. There was no time then (thought we) to proceed any farther: and yet before God, there was nothing at all, it seemeth, that hindred indeed (other things, I grant, might then be praetended) but onely the immoderate loue we had then to our priuate; but that may we see was thoroughly followed▪ by those that were in any place of such aduantage. Of that which since hath bin so busily
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:7530:265"/> followed to the vse of the whole, more than in the daies of those our elders th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued before, I grant there may be some doubt conceiued, for that it might euer seeme to be carried by a care of the publique good of v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> all: and so was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> indeede, so far as there was no more done, than for the defense, maintainance and honour of the State was needfull to be. But if there were any needlesse burthens imposed on the lower, to raise vp some needlesse helpes to some higher (a doubt that in these our daies lay not far of to be conceiued) then was that publique but priuate also. The course that in such case God vseth to take, is, that when folke wil not, they shal not: as heere we may see he dealt with the <hi>Iewes.</hi> For when as hauing such time as they had, they neuerthelesse were so easily hindered, that so they might the rather go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout their priuate, God then so ordained, that they should bee hindered indeede, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> which was by that inhibition giuen them. A generall warning to vs all, to take time when it pleaseth God to giue it; else not to thinke much if hee also take it from vs again: and to haue this circumspection, as in all things else, so especially in reedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying the Temple of God. We, in those daies that lately we spake of, had indeed many rubs cast in the way: but if wee marke, neyther were they, till first our selues lingered; and, from that time forward, they did still increase vpon vs. So that slipping time when we might, hardly came it after so fitly againe. God grant that yet, if so it may stand with the good pleasure of God, it may be euer taken as it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riseth. That which appertaineth to the greater sort chiefly, is, that the House of the Lord is not so easily repaired, as many it seemeth doe thinke that it is. <hi>Cyrus,</hi> hauing giuen them leaue, and some helpe vnto it, and hauing done that in so good manner as indeede he had done, thought as it seemeth, that it would haue serued: himselfe would prosecute his good successe to the enlarging of those his Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and so hee did. Himselfe acknowledged, that God had commanded him to build him an House in <hi>Ierusalem:</hi> and he implyed a plaine grant withall, that God had waged him already right well, to doe it, hauing giuen him, as himselfe told vs, all the Kingdomes of the earth. And he hauing done that which he did, belike he thought, that therein hee had done as much as God would haue looked for at his hands. But he was deceiued: he was without quaestion a notable Prince, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny good things we find in him; but he was not well acquainted (as yet) with God. He was but an Heathen man: and knew not how striktly God would looke, that what he commanded, should with all diligence, and to the full, haue beene perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. Hee did not consider, that God commanding that vnto him, did withall im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply a <hi>Supersedeas</hi> to all thinges else, or Sequestration from them, till that were don: hee thought God would bee more easily answered; or that hee might in the meane season prosecute those his other affaires, and greater too (as it seemeth hee tooke them; and it is certaine, that others do) and afterward do this at more laisure. But God would not be so dealt withall by him: seeing hee no better did that which hee should; he did soone cut him off from that which he would. God had giuen him so much glory already, that it was not for him now to looke for any such augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation thereof at the hands of him, whose glory in this so much he neglected: but rather to haue resolued on this, and to haue assured himselfe thereof, that heerein aduauncing (the best that he could) the glory of him that had brought him thus far already, he should that way soonest haue attained to all that glory, and those Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions that yet abode him. But he leauing this the open and the readiest way, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> and that which was to him enioyned, he tooke another much more sutable to flesh and blood, and thereafter, in pitifull manner, perished in it. This might he haue done, without any hazzard at all of the blood of any, his owne, or others (if not to the sauing of very much which otherwise might be easily spilt:) that course that he tooke, could not be any way performed, but with much hazzard of blood; and, as it fell out, there was very much blood-sheading about it. It was first indeede but the blood of others; but by and by after, euen to the full, required with his: and that in dishonourable manner too, after that first the honour of God was so lightly regarded. A iudgement of God of speciall moment, euer to be before the eyes of those that haue charge: euer to account it their chiefe and principall businesse, to

The like wee may see when they write to the King, for that they did but plainely write of the case as it was, without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny mingling of any bitternesse or Gall against them: and very indifferently refer it vnto him, whether it please him to cause search to bee made whether any such graunt was made them, or not; and what his pleasure was in that case to be done. Some way or other no doubt they were muzzeld, beeing so curst thinges as they were, and yet did so little offer to bite. In the processe of the cause ensuing the most of Gods dealing was with those others: but some part of it likewise with the Iewes.

For all ages ensuing, he putteth all Kinges and peoples vnder a greeuous and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full cursse, and the same to descend vnto them from the selfe-same God that had <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> put his name there, whosoeuer should after put to their handes to destroy that house of God at <hi>Hierusalem.</hi> A Story of great worth to be marked, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in respect of that which he did: but also in respect of the person that he sustay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. In that which he did, one thing we may note throughout the whole: an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, out of one part of it. Throughout the whole wee may see, that in that cause (which was the building vp againe of the house of God in <hi>Hierusalem)</hi> he did not temporize, but was very resolute: as not only Princes, but all others also, should euer be, in the cause of Religion. A matter so much the rather to bee marked, for that the vndoubted wisedome of God hath here set downe this for a patterne: whereas it is but onely the wisdome of flesh and bloud that giueth that other direction vnto vs; heere also approoued by the effect that then ensued. That one part of it is, in that so hee thundereth against whatsoeuer Kinges and peoples should afterward goe about to impeach the house of God there: the truth where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we haue in Iesus Christ, and in our Churches, wherein the name of God is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led vpon, and wherein his people haue the vse of his word and Sacraments. And seeing that it pleaseth God somtimes to vse but meane instruments to great good purposes (as when hee spake by <hi>Balaam</hi> himselfe, and by his Asse) the matter it selfe is of that Nature, that leadeth vs to conceiue that it is of GOD: and then, both that it is a definitiue sentence of God himselfe, though vttered but by that King then; and that it incloseth within the daunger of it, all such as now also any
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:7530:266"/> way impeach the estate of the Church among vs. In respect of the person that hee sustained, one thing is plaine: another, very probable too. That which is plaine, is, that he was but an Heathen man: and in that rude age of the World. A matter of iust condemnation to many Christians: nowe in this great light of the Gospell. That which is probable, is, that the King that wee speake of was a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

In which Gouernours aforesaide wee haue withall a very good patterne, what hope we might haue of such like among vs, Enemies yet to the Gospell of Christ, and to the building vppe againe of his Temple heere: namely, that although yet, so long as they see that they are but dallyed withall, they praetend full smoothly, that their conscience forsooth will not suffer thē to come to the church, or at least, not to communicate; yet were they kindly dealt with indeed, as these others were here, conscience or no conscience, then would they come. For though their praetence or outward appearance for the time beare a faire shew, in certaine of them, as though in no wise they might be mooued: yet seeing that lighly they haue (among all the sort of them) no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science at all, but such as resteth not on the word of God but vppon pollicy, pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate combinations, and both vnaduised and wicked oaths, we need not to doubt, but that that kind of conscience is of so good fellow-like a nature, that it will rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily go with them whither soeuer themselues list, hither and thither, to this side &amp; that, yea forward and back-ward, euen as they will; and will euer bee loath, goe which way they list, to tarry behind them.</p>
            <p n="5">5 As touching those that tarryed behind when these others returned, we are first to consider who they were: then, what is the Story of them.

Howbeit seeing the Text nameth two such heere to haue returned with the rest, it is most likely that they also returned with their Bretheren, but then went backe to <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi> againe. It is the manner of the best natured men to accompany their friends
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:7530:267"/> in speciall iournies, at the least for a good part of them: and the wiser sort haue e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer thought it wisedome, that so many as were men of speciall reckoning, should in all such actions as they would haue to go forward, be formost themselues, or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

So it may very well be, that these also, eyther in kindnesse as they were bretheren and good men besides, or else for example to draw the mo with them, being of such account among them as they were, did now also returne although we haue yet no Story of them: as also we may easily conceiue, that there w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

Yet because wee haue no Story of them yet; and that by likelihoode when they had brought their bretheren home, they returned backe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine for the good of those their bretheren: therefore haue I also for this time thought good, to make no other reckoning of them, than as yet remaining behind; and of those the Story will afterward shew, that there were many others besides of whom we haue no particular mention.</p>
            <p n="6">6 Now therefore as touching the Story of these, we may well conceiue that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> there were two sortes of them: some that staied there for the good of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; others, but in worldly respects. Of those that seeme to haue stayed there for the good of the people, one there is of very great and speciall account, that, for ought that wee reade, staied there still: but others, that afterward came home to their bretheren. He that was of speciall account, and for ought that we reade of, stayed there still, was <hi>Daniell</hi> the Prophet. On whom although wee haue alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> heard somewhat in the proper place thereunto appertaining, as then the consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of him was but a part of the Story of the whole people: yet now that wee are to consider thereof as his own proper Story, in this place, in that respect, it shall not be amisse to consider somewhat more fully of it, his case therefore was such, as that soone after the <hi>Persian</hi> Monarchie got vp there, he was brought into great pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill of his life: but wonderfully deliuered againe. So it shall bee good for vs to consider, first of his perill: then, how he was deliuered from it. In his perill wee are likewise to consider, first of the occasion of it: then, of the danger it selfe. The occasion of it consisted, if we marke, of two principall branches: one, the fauour the King did vouchsafe him; the other, the enuie of the Nobles against him. The fauour that the King did vouchsafe him, was very great; and besides hee meant greater vnto him: and the reason was, the excellency of the spirit, or, as wee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly <note place="margin">Dan. 6: 1-3</note> speake, the great worth or worthinesse that the King noted in him; as also it may probably be, that the fame that before might iustly go on him, especially by his late praediction of <hi>Balthasars</hi> fall, might occasion the King first to cast his eye vnto him. A matter so much the more worthie to be considered, if we marke what ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour it was the King did vouchsafe him: and whereupon the King did vouchsafe the same vnto him. The honour he did vouchsafe him was, to be one of the chiefe in the affaires of all his Dominions, hauing then an hundred and twenty Kingdomes or Prouinces vnder him; so placing a Prophet in very high place in matters of state: a very absurd thing, in the distempered humors of many; but heere not onely put in yre (and to great good purpose too) by that Heathen King, but left enrouled to our instruction by God himselfe. If we marke whereupon the King did it, we finde that it was, not for any cunning or fetching head, or for that hee could deepely dissemble, much lesse for any bad deuises he had to wring in the wealth of others, and to keepe all low but themselues; but for the excellency of the Spirit that was in him: a speciall good patterne to shew vnto Princes, in what ranke of people they may soonest finde such as are for them; so that withall they euer take heede of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous mixtures oft-times concurring. Whereupon the enuy of the Nobles did arise against him we haue not expressed, being belike left vs as a matter of that faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, that euery one himselfe may finde it: but that it was great, is very plainely no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto vs. In that it is left to our selues to gather, whence it arose, we are by it
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:7530:267"/> onely sufficiently taught, that none lightly can haue any speciall place of honour or fauour about a Prince, but that others will take it ill, &amp; seeke to vndermine him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; especially being such as he was, a stranger then, and a captiue before: and that no <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> worthinesse of the party whatsoeuer, can bee against all a protection vnto him; all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers (to speake of) accounting themselues, though neuer so meane, yet to be of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable good worthinesse too. How great this enuy of theirs was against him, we haue by two thinges set downe vnto vs: one, that they sought no lesse than his life; the other, that they did it, when neuerthelesse themselues could finde no fault at all with him. In that no lesse than his life would please them, we may see how plainly they aduenture their liues, that prease to the higher places in Court: thereby making themselues a marke for others to aim-at. In that they did it, when neuerthelesse they could finde no fault with him, and thereupon did cast otherwise to intrap him, we are not onely to marke, as afore, that innocency in such case doth not euer secure vs; but farther to consider withall, of that speciall deuise of theirs that they had to intrap him: and first, what they concluded among themselues; then, what they obtained of the King. Themselues concluded, when they had wacht him long before, that they <note place="margin">Dan. 6: 4, 5</note> should neuer finde any fault with him, as touching the discharge of the trust to him committied in the place he was in: and that the onely way to intrap him would bee, some way or other to seeke to do it by the Lawe of his God that he professed; and so resolued first to make a decree for their purpose, and then to moue the King therein. <hi>Daniell</hi> then was an happy man, that walked so euen in all his waies, in so great a charge, in so high a place, ouer so many Countries, and in such fauour with his Prince, that none of them all, though gladly they would, was able to lay any thing to his charge: a wonder rather than a Story to vs, who cannot haue any so little such place of aduantage, but that we are so farre from walking so euen that no body can charge vs; as that wee haue much a-doe to stop the mouthes of whole Countries, that they cry not out against vs. On the other side, if any would lay a plot to catch vs, by any constancy or deuotion in vs in our Religion, and wee any way vnderstoode that that way were laid some plot to catch vs, wee then could walke so iust and euen betwixt heauen and earth, that Foulers could neuer liue by their Trade, if they could no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter deale with the wiliest foule that is, than these other Birders could at any time pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile against vs: Long might they fast, if needes they would still keepe their sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke for so dainty a dish. That which they obtained of the King, was as touching the decree that they had made: and so are wee first to consider of that decree; then, how they did in the end obtaine it. In that decree wee are to consider, not onely what it was in it selfe: but much rather what it was in respect of the vse whereunto it was ordained. What it was in it selfe, is plain enough in the Text: namely, that none <note place="margin">Dan. 6: 4-7</note>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> should for thirty daies space, make any request to God or man, but onely vnto the King himselfe; and, if any did, that then he should be cast into the den of Lyons. In respect of the vse, whereunto it was ordained, first wee may plainely see, that great Counsellers sometimes, are but meanly occupied, and become trap-makers too: and not euer but some of them of lesse reckoning; but euen all the whole company of them (for so they plead, that it was the doing of them all) and so consequently, euen the flower of them withall. Then, that for the more easie obtaining of it, they sticke not to seeme to haue it their meaning, to defie their King, or to make a God of him: and yet that they do it in wisedome too, not vrging to the people too much at once, and therefore appointing (for the first time yet) but thirty daies onely. In that these great Counsellers heere, do so lie in wait, by the helpe of the King to intrap <hi>Daniell,</hi> Princes haue a reasonable good warning to take good heede, that of those that are the greatest about them, if any be more faithfull than the rest, the others do not abuse their help to intrap them: and in the other, that if in their greatnesse they cannot bee content still to be men, lightly they haue such about them, as (for one purpose, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) will not sticke soone to make them to swallow. How in the end they did ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it, that we may the better see, we are to note, that one part of it they easily got: but hardly the other. That which they did easily get, was to haue the King to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme <note place="margin">Dan. 6: 8, 9</note> it, or to establish it: which they did no sooner moue, but that he readily granted,
<pb n="512" facs="tcp:7530:268"/> adding his confirmation or seale vnto it. A patterne plaine enough in it selfe, both how readily such as are in high place about Princes, will sometimes abuse them: and how easily Princes themselues if they take not good heede, are by those that they trust abused. That which they did more hardly obtaine, was the execution of it: concerning which, first wee are to see how there was an offense found to bee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted; then, how the execution thereon was obtained. The offense that was found to bee committed, was, in that <hi>Daniell</hi> vsed prayer still after his wonted man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: <note place="margin">Dan. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>: 10, 11.</note> and they purposely watching, tooke him so doing. Whereby it seemeth first very plaine that <hi>Daniell</hi> was wont to vse prayer: and, not altogether vnlikely (sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing that none but himselfe, was thereupon accused or troubled) to bee with his Family also, for that they did so well know it, and wrought thereupon; and for that now they could so readily come vpon him when hee was so occupied. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, if it were such prayer as himselfe vsed alone, it is not vnlikely, but to such pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose hee would haue taken some place more priuate: as both the nature of that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> kinde of prayer requireth; and it is the manner of the best men to doe, as Christ also himselfe dooth afterward teach. For that the window towardes <hi>Ierusalem</hi> in <note place="margin">Mat. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>: 6.</note> the place where hee was at prayer, was open, it is not needefull that so wee take it, as if purposely hee did it not caring who saw what they did; or that so hee would doe, purposely to crosse that wicked decree: but that the place where hee was wont to bee at prayer, was so coasted, that it was open towardes <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> that so he and his Family vsing to direct themselues towardes it in their prayer (as <hi>Salomon</hi> had <note place="margin">1 King. 8: 46. 53.</note> conceiued before, that in such case the faithfull would doe, and withall had desired that God would then heare them) might more earnestly bee stirred vp thereby vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to prayer, and seeke to meete with such fauour of GOD in the way that for it was thus farre praescribed vnto them. Where also it is to bee noted, that now they were in their enemies Land, where there was no publique prayer or exercise of true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion to God: and that therefore it was more meete for <hi>Daniell</hi> to haue it at home, for him and his. For where Religion is professed and the Publike exercise there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of allowed, there should the Publique place by all bee frequented: and the rather, both to the better leading on of others; and to praeuent the wilinesse and distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered zeale of some, who vnder praetense of prayer in priuate houses, vndermine the peoples regard to the publique, and besides breede in diuers thinges, sects and diuision. The execution heereon was obtained, by their great importunity with <note place="margin">Dan. 6: 12-18</note> the King, who otherwise would gladly haue deliuered <hi>Daniell,</hi> but that they were so importunate with him, vrging the stricktnesse of the Lawes of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians,</hi> that being once made, they might not for any mans cause bee broken: and so in the ende <hi>Daniell</hi> according to that new Lawe, onely for that cause purposely made, was cast into the den of the Lyons; but sore against the minde of the King, if with the consent of his Nobles hee might haue done it. In which strictnesse of the Lawes of the <hi>Medes</hi> and the <hi>Persians</hi> it shall bee good for vs more specially to marke, one thing that is very commendable in them: another that is as defectiue too. Commendable it is, that they had so speciall care of putting their Lawes in due execution when once they were made: not sparing the greater sort therein, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partiality that is too vsuall with vs. But defectiue they were in that there was not praerogatiue left in the handes of the King, to dispense with such thinges, as came not within the sense or meaning of the Lawe; but onely within the letter of it. Not that wee may account this Lawe that wee speake of to be altogether of that nature: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> but that the resolutnesse of their speaches importeth that there was no such helpe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued. For in this Law that we speak of, it was the chiefe meaning of those Nobles, to giue that stranger such a chirt among them: and though it were sore against the Kings mind, that when <hi>Daniell</hi> was come within the danger of it, it should bee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted on him; yet can we not so properly thereupon say, that the King had no such meaning, as that the King was by them ouer-reached, and did ouerslip himselfe in it, including that he neuer thought of. His deliuerance out of this danger was such, as very effectually wrought with the King besides: but first of that his deliuerance; then, in what sort it wrought with the King. Againe his deliuerance it selfe was such,
<pb n="513" facs="tcp:7530:268"/> that he was not onely deliuered from those sauage Lyons: but also to the destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of those that caused him to bee cast in vnto them, as sauage as they. That hee was deliuered from the Lyons the King himselfe found the next morning betime; &amp; <note place="margin">Dan. 6▪ 19-24</note> so was he taken out from them againe: and, on the other side, the others cast in, not onely themselues, but also their Wiues and Children with them; to whom the Lions then gaue no sparing, but made a ready and quicke dispatch of them all. Which example of Gods great and wonderfull protection of <hi>Daniell,</hi> and the seuerity of his Iustice on those his Enemies, so wrought with the King, that not onely him-selfe gaue glory to GOD: but also commaunded all his Dominions to doe the like; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainting <note place="margin">Dan. 6: 25-27</note> them with that which at this time he had for <hi>Daniell</hi> done. A great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation to many of vs, that an Heathen King shoulde bee so ready for this one great worke to publish the name of the Lord: and we being Christians, and thereby made acquainted with great numbers of such workes of his towardes vs and others, neuerthelesse are nothing so ready to acquaint others there-with to his glory, not onely such as are farther of, but not so much as our neerest friends or neighbours, no nor those of whom we haue charge, our Children and Seruants.</p>
            <p n="7">7 Those that after came home ta their Bretheren, were two: <hi>Esra</hi> the one; <hi>Nehemiah</hi> the other. The Story of <hi>Ezra</hi> is in effect no more but this, that consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
               <note place="margin">Ezra.</note> of the case of his Bretheren, and beeing himselfe able to instruct them in the knowledge of God, and hauing some fauour, as it seemeth, already with the King, he thought to see if he could be able to compasse, that so hee might bee by the King imployed: and speeding very well therein, he then got others vnto him, and did make <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> his repaire accordingly; so to bestow his labour among his Bretheren that were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready returned. So are wee first to consider of this his comming vnto them: then, what he did when he came there. In this his comming vnto them, we are likewise to consider; first, what was his purpose or meaning in it: then, howe it pleased God to prosper him therein. His purpose or meaning was for their good, much like to that of <hi>Moses,</hi> when he left the Court to go and see how his Brethren did vnder theyr bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens: and no doubt a speciall worke of Gods holy spirite in him. For hauing stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyed <note place="margin">Exod. 2: 11 Act. 7: 23. Ezr. 7: 1-10 1 Esdr. 8: 1-8</note> befor the Law of God, and hauing attained vnto good knowledge therein, he now resolued, or tooke purpose with himselfe, or, as there it is sayde, praepared his heart to some speciall seruice of God: namely, to seeke the Lord, or to doe him, as the case was then, the best seruice he could; and so determined, to goe into <hi>Iury</hi> to his Bretheren that were gone home before, and to teach them the knowledge and feare of GOD. A rare, and a speciall good Story: well to bee considered of all; and an example to great good vse in all ages among vs. For his purpose was, to leaue the place where now he was seated (as we may probably conceiue, for that he tarryed so long behinde his Bretheren that went home first) and well too, it may seeme by his so long tarrying there, and the fauour we finde a little after he had with the King: and to goe into <hi>Iury</hi> to his Bretheren there, to bestow his labour, in that aforesaide instruction, on them. If wee marke the Story (and he was not like to bee ignorant of it) whereas there went not downe full out fifty thousand in all, of themselues and their Seruants, we finde, that foure thousand sixe hundred and thirty <note place="margin">Ezr. 2: 64, 65 Ibid. 36-42.</note> of them were Priestes and Leuites, all of them, by Gods ordinance and theyr owne profession, teachers of the people. So falleth it out, that they had so many Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers (by profession) among them already, that euery of them, one with another, had not full out fiue persons of all the rest to teach: and so might this purpose of his seeme to be needelesse; and to some, but onely a weake conceite of his owne. But <hi>Esra</hi> belike, did much more deepely consider, than many others: both of that late desolation that was among them; &amp; of their praesent estate at that iime also. For the late desolation that was among thē, hauing no exercise of their profession, conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing with those that were Idolatrous, &amp; ouer-ruled by them, must needs make such a dissipation of Religion, and all good order among them, as could hardly bee reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered againe many yeares after. Their praesent estate also could in no wise be, for such matters, but pittifull yet, the building of the Temple it selfe being hindered, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
               <pb n="514" facs="tcp:7530:269"/> being in so great an hazzard, whether euer it should goe forward or not. For so we may be sure, the Priestes and Leuites were not yet restored to their needefull and wonted maintenance, but were compelled otherwise to helpe themselues, and to supply their owne necessities so well as they could: as also there may be no better hope conceiued, but that such as did imploy themselues in the ministery (&amp; those by likelihood but few) neither had the people any thing well attendant, nor were themselues but faintly occupyed, or but after a secondary manner. <hi>Esra</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore might well conceiue, that in such case some body had need to bestow some speciall labour about them, and thereupon did yeeld himselfe to that seruice. And so among vs it were to be wished, that seeing in the most of the greatest Parishes, the due and needefull maintenance of the Ministery is so strongly with-held from those Churches, that there can bee no maintenance had for an able man among them; and many of those able men that otherwise wee haue, seeing their people, (for want of stronger order taken) so carelesse, and all the whole sway of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple about them, so vniuersally carried to the praesent things of this world, do but easily follow their function also: it would please God to stir vp, and to send forth some such store of <hi>Esraes</hi> among vs, as that at least the most desolate places might in some good measure be relieued thereby; and that some of the Issue or Stocke of those, that so with-hold the right of these Churches, would buckle themselues vnto the Ministery, &amp; on their owne charges make so good supply, as God should cable them to doe. This extraordinary course of his, especially beeing so vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersall, or bending it selfe towardes the whole people generally, might bee some checke vnto the easier labour of others, and by them therefore the hardlier censu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: but it was the hand of God that was vppon therein, both a sufficient warrant <note place="margin">Ezr. 7: 6. 1 Esdr. 8: 28</note> in his owne conscience, and a strong defense against others. It pleased God to prosper him therein, both while yet he was in <hi>Babylon:</hi> and in his way home-ward too. While yet he was in <hi>Babylon,</hi> it pleased God so to worke (in a manner) in the hearts of all, that on euery side he had great encouragement and helpe to that his good purpose, in plentifull measure: first of the King himselfe; then, also of others. It pleased God so to worke in the heart of the King himselfe, that hee dealt maruellous graciously with him: insomuch, that although it seemeth, that <hi>Ezra</hi> desired very much of him; yet was the King nothing behind in liberal gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. For that it was the request of <hi>Ezra,</hi> we need not to doubt, for that the Text it selfe doth doth so tearme it: and that the King was as free in granting, it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth <note place="margin">Ezr. 7: 6. 1 E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

First therefore it shall be good to see what it was that <hi>Ezra</hi> desired, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> and the King did grant him: then, to mark what vse we may make thereof to our selues. What <hi>Ezra</hi> desired, wee haue not in particular noted vnto vs; but onely what the King graunted vnto him: but seeing we vnderstand already, that both are one, we need go no farther, but onely to that which heere wee haue deliuered vnto vs. The King therefore we find to haue dealt very graciously with him, both in the authority &amp; credence he gaue him: and by the aid that he did afford him out of his treasure besides. Authority and credence are in nature so linked together, especially the latter of them vnto the former, that where it goeth before, there doth the other necessarily follow. Yet is <hi>Ezra</hi> in so speciall good liking with the King, that besides the authority that he doth giue him, hee diuers times in playne tearmes doth expresse how worthy a man he accounteth him to be, and what spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall <note place="margin">Ezr. 7: 12, 14-16, 18, 21, 25 Ibid. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

The better to do the businesse it selfe when he came home, he gaue him authority, from himselfe and his seauen Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellers <note place="margin">Ezr. 7: 14.</note> (the highest authority of all that was there) to make first such inquiry and search how all things stood there: as that so finding al such wants or griefes as thē did vrge them, he might then so much the better prouide remedy for them. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing gatheted him to such aduisement first, then it seemeth by the course of the Commission it selfe he leadeth him, first to such things as concern certain of them <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> more specially: rhen, vnto such <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> concerne all generally. Those whom the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission doth respect more specially, are first, such as appertaine to the Land of <hi>Iury:</hi> then, certaine that confine vpon them. Of such as appertaine to the land of <hi>Iury,</hi> a couple there are that are so specially regarded: the Temple it selfe, &amp; the due wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of God therein; &amp; so many of the <hi>Iewes</hi> themselues as were imploied therea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout. For the Temple it selfe and the due seruice of God therein, the king doth by this his Commission, first prouide for certaine things more specially: then, for all together generally. Those that he prouideth for more specially, are, first for the right imploiment or vse of certain things they had already: then, for some others that might be wanting. The things they had already, were, the Treasure and Plate that they brought with them: of which treasure they were praesently to lay foorth <note place="margin">Ezr. 7: 17, 18 1 Esdr. 8: 15-17</note> what shold be needful, for al such sacrifices as were from time to time to be offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and all the rest to be disposed as <hi>Ezra</hi> himselfe, and his Brethren should think good, to the vse of Gods seruice; &amp; all the Plate or holy vessels, were to be placed <note place="margin">Ezr. 7: 19 1 Esdr. 8: 18</note> in the temple to the vse of Gods seruice, as to euery sort of them should appertain. Those otaers that might be wanting, were such as the King and his Counsell con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued might be mo than they could think of; and therefore took order for those <note place="margin">Ezr. 7: 20-22 1 Esd. 8: 19-21</note> things also: and that in such sort as is worthy the marking, both for the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in such case praescribed; and in what sort it should bee deliuered. For the proportion was very liberall: making no stay, so long as it did not exceede an hundered Talents of Siluer; and the like proportion (in theyr kinde) in Wheat, Wine, Oyle, and Salt. For the manner of the deliuery of it, the Deputies in the Countries adioyning were commaunded, in such sort to doe it, as that the Iewes could neuer haue wished a readier nor a better way: they beeing commaunded, that it should forth-with bee deliuered without delay; euen onely vppon <hi>Esraes</hi> requaest, or when he should call for it. Not so content with these limitations, he farther commaundeth generallie, that whatsoeuer by Gods appointment is to bee <note place="margin">Ezr. 7: 23. 1 Esdr. 8: 22</note> done for the House of the Lord, that it be speedily done, least otherwise the wrath of God be bent against them: thereby seeming to imply, that already they had felt some hand of God vpon them; and that it was, for that they had no better regard to the house of God. For so many of the <hi>Iewes</hi> as were imploied about the House of God, the order that he tooke, was, that no tole, tribute, or custome should be <note place="margin">Ezr. 7: 24. 1 Esdr. 8: 23 Ezr. 7: 25 1 Esdr. 8: 24</note> laid vpon them. For those peoples that did confine vpon them, he authorized <hi>Esra</hi> to appoint such Gouernours ouer them, as hee should like of: the King himselfe directing him therein to appoint such, so neere as hee could, as already knew the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> law of the Lord; and to teach it to others that knew it not. Those things that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned all generally, either the Iewes themselues, or those peoples that confined vpon them, as also the Officers and Gouernors of eyther of them (but especially, it seemeth, of those other peoples) were none others but diuers sorts of punishments, <note place="margin">Ezr. 7: 26 1 Esdr. 8: 25</note> which at his own election or discretion, he had power to inflict on those that were
<pb n="516" facs="tcp:7530:270"/> disobedient, eyther to the Law of God, or vnto the Law of the King: giuing him both authority and charge, to punish all such without delay. And those punnish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were, some to remooue the offenders from them, either altogether taking them away as by death; or but chasing them away out of the Countrey, as by banishment: or more easily punnishing them within the Land, as by confiscati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of goodes, or imprisonment. This beeing the effect of the Kinges Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, and the authority and credence that hee gaue vnto <hi>Ezra,</hi> and we bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now to see what vse wee may make heereof to our selues, wee are to know that best we may doe it, if heerein we shall duly marke, how farre the King con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descended to him on the behalfe of the House of GOD: and what authoritie it was where-withall he did inuest him. On the behalfe of the House of God, it is plaine, that the King did yeelde maruellous farre: a speciall good matter to be considered vppon, both for all generally; and for certaine of vs more specy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally. All generally may note a very rare and a speciall zeale in this Heathen King towardes the House of God in <hi>Hierusalem:</hi> a great condemnation to all such Christian Princes, and other great ones besides, whom God hath enabled to such purpose, and yet, neglect their duty therein; and a faire patterne for all such men (and for all others in theyr measure) to lay before them, and out of it to learne, to what pitch or degree they ought to come in that case especially, if they would haue the Testimony of a good conscience, that they haue perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med any thing neere that point of dutie. Certaine of vs more specially might out of this learne, that wee should not be so Meale-mouthed as many of vs are, so fearefull and doubtfull of any good successe in any motion for the House of GOD, that other-wise gladly wee would exihbit to the greater sort among vs, but that wee doubt wee should not leese our labour in it: and then lightly wee cull out some odde trifle or other (a matter, I meane, of no moment to speake of in comparison of that which indeede were to bee doone) and make our motion or suit for it, as beeing the vtter-most that wee may in any wise hope to obtaine. So commeth it to passe, that when wee are so feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in moouing or demaunding that which is due, euen that onely doth much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolden <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> those that are the detainers of it to doe nothing at all; or at least with much a-doe, and as it were of great liberality, and much more than they needed, to grant vs those trifles that so we demaund. <hi>Ezra</hi> did not so: but made a right large demand indeed (and yet no more, than was needfull for the businesse it selfe, and due to bee by the King performed) and God so prospered him therein, that, setting himselfe so well as hee did to glorify God, and no whit yeelding to part stakes therein, that he obtained all he desired, finding the King as ready to grant, as himselfe was to demaund. Wee had a matter some-what like in <hi>Moses</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, when <hi>Pharaoh</hi> could bee content they went, so they left theyr Cattle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde: <note place="margin">Exod. 10: 24-26.</note> when <hi>Moses</hi> notwithstanding would not yeelde therein neyther, not so much as to leaue any one of them all, so to redeeme passage for the rest. And bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so resolute, God did prosper him there-after: foorth-with giuing most open and free passage to all. On the other side, it was not the dignity of <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> nor the fauour that God did beare them, especially to <hi>Moses</hi> (no not when hee earnestly praied to bee released of it) that could acquite them of a speciall <note place="margin">Nū. 20: 7-12</note> chasticement that GOD would needes lay vppon them, onely for that they were but doubtfull or timorous in an hard peece of seruice that hee had enioyned them, beeing a thing very vnlikely to come to passe as hee had directed them to expect: euen for that they did not speake to an hard dry Rocke thereby, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen in the praesence of the people, and as it were with authority, or imperious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commaunding it, to giue foorth abundance of Water to the vse of Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; as hard a case, as this of ours that nowe wee speake of. For, GOD bee thanked, our Princes and great men haue beene so long, and now are so well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the truth of God, that we may well hope, that there is more ability and readinesse in them to yeelde whatsoeuer is needefull to the aduancement of the glory of God among vs: than in a dry Rocke, to yeeld forth, on the suddaine,
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:7530:270"/> such aboundance of water. The nature of the authority wherewith the King did inuest the person of <hi>Ezra,</hi> was for the most part, meerely ciuill; himselfe being but an Ecclesiasticall person onely: a faire patterne, n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> onely that such persons may be inuested with such authority; but also, that the King himselfe, and his seauen Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellors (the flower, belike, for experience and wisedome, so farre as he was able to iudge) in al his Dominions, which were many &amp; great, in wisedom thought good to make choise of that man, &amp; so to furnish him to that businesse. A matter of reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble good satisfaction to those, that so hardly digest, that such persons should at any <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> time haue any such power to them committed: and reasonable plainely emplying withall, whence it is that the cause of the Gospel, and estate of the Church, haue yet no better successe among vs; and that it is neuer like to be better, so long as such as were likelyest to do it, are so carefully helde off from the assembly of those, whence our hope is, that it might be obtained.</p>
            <p n="8">8 Those others whence he had encouragement and helpe besides, were partly other peoples there: and partly his owne Countrey-men too. Those other <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> peoples there, were such as were of the Kings Dominions; who for manie of them <note place="margin">Ezr. 7: 16, 8▪25</note> were Contributors, and gaue their Offering to the House of the Lord: Namely, the Kings seauen Counsellors, certaine of his Princes, and of the people. What any of them in particular gaue, we haue it not noted; and no maruell, when wee haue not any note of that which the King himselfe did giue, as wee sawe before: but by the totall following it will appeare, that they bestowed verie well, either all of them generally, or certayne of them more specially. Of his owne Countrey-men in those partes diuers there were, that were Contributarie too, bringing in <note place="margin">Ezr. 7: 16. 8: 25</note> theyr Offering also: but many of these gaue him greater encouragement than so, for that they ioyned them-selues vnto him in that his good purpose, in some good measure, addressing them-selues to depart from thence, and to go home to theyr Countrey with him. Wherein the most commendable part of that actions of theirs, was not, that they did accompany him home: but in that, he going about so good businesse, they were as it seemeth in that respect willing, in their measure to be partakers with him. For, by likely-hood, but few or none of all this companie, were borne in <hi>Iury,</hi> but onely in <hi>Babylon,</hi> and in the Prouinces adioyning, where their parents and they were a long time in Captiuity, though by this time it is not vnlikely, but that they had gotten better hold among them. What time it was that <hi>Ezra</hi> came downe, it is not indeed by the learned agreed: but there is none, that probably doth reckon so short a time, but that these which now go down with <hi>Ez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra,</hi> must needs be altogether another generation (some few particulars it may bee, onely excepted) than those that came into Captiuity. Which being so, then it is not so likely, that these were so ready to go into <hi>Iury,</hi> as to their natiue country (in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> which respect they might rather haue had a desire to haue stayed where they were already:) but that, being of that people, to whom not only that land was gyuen, but also this prerogatiue withall, that they were the onely peculiar people of God, in duty it seemeth, and in godly zeale, they resolued them-selues now to goe with him; so to helpe forward the worship and seruice of God (or as we do often tearm it, the cause of Religion) together with the good of their Bretheren there, the best that they could. A thing that must needes be maruellous comfortable vnto <hi>Ezra,</hi> to haue so many, so farre to ioyne with him, in so good a purpose as it: plyable hearts in the people, with whome in such case wee are to deale, and readynesse in them to take part with vs in any good labour, beeing a greater comfort indeede, than outwarde helpes were at any time lightly able to reach vnto. But in thys wee finde, that hee had not this helpe of them all, of theyr owne accord: but that he was faine to haue some farther busines for certain of them. For when as he tooke the view of those that were assembled vnto him (hauing first a little entered into his iourny) he found that they were about 1486. persons: but none of the <hi>Leuits</hi> among <note place="margin">Ezr 8: 1-20 1 Esd. 8: 29-48 <hi>Conr. Pellic.</hi>
               </note> them all (besides such as were of the Priests;) nor it seemeth any of the others that were to do inferior seruices about the House of God. But then specially sending for
<pb n="518" facs="tcp:7530:271"/> some of both sorts of them, he got two hundered and eight and fifty of them: and so had in all one thousand, seauen hundred forty and foure. But that these espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially were no more forward <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> themselues, but that <hi>Ezra</hi> was faine so to send for them, it seemeth necessarily to argue one of these two: eyther that they were exceeding slacke in that point of duty; or else, that some way or other they vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, or at least themselues conceiued, that the estate of their bretheren that were already returned, was yet so hard, that they durst not aduenture yet to goe thither. Sure it is, that oft-times wee haue experience of both: namely, that such as by their function or charge ought to be of the formost, are oft-times of the slackest; and that the maintainance of the Ministery is so kept from them, that they are faine to leaue of their calling therein, and otherwise to shift for themselues so well as they can. How it pleased God to prosper him in his way homeward we soone may finde, first in the beginning of that his iourney; then, throughout the whole course of it besides. In the beginning of that his iourney, we finde it in two principall matters: one, about his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> whole iourney; the other, about one speciall charge he had with him. That which was about his whole iourney, was for the safety of their passage or getting home, in <note place="margin">Ezra. 8: 21-23 1 Esd. 8: 49-52</note> respect of such as might haue assaulted them by the way, as the iourney was long, and the world loose then: and this so much the rather, because they had omitted one helpe before; and so was God very good vnto them, to put into their minds to take hold on another now. That which they had omitted before, was to haue desired forces of the King to haue conducted them home against their enemies: and this doth <hi>Ezra</hi> acknowledge that he was ashamed to doe, for that he had before borne himselfe so much on the assistance of God, on behalfe of those that were his, against all their enemies. The other, that God did put in their mind, now to take hold of to make supply, was, that they held a Fast to the Lord, and ioyned prayer withall, that it would please him to defend them, and to bring them safe home: the better way of the two, and more seemely for those that professe God; and yet the other in no wise to bee refused neyther, when the case doth so require, or it pleaseth him to offer it to any. A good patterne also, how the children of God in their distresse do seeke vnto him: whereas the manner of others is, euer to secure themselues by earthly helps, and neuer lightly to haue any mind of the other. That speciall charge of theirs where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they tooke some order also, was about certaine treasure that they had with them, <note place="margin">Ezr. 8: 24-30 1 Esd. 8: 53-59</note> and were to carry vnto <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> being dedicated thereunto already; now making choyce of certaine speciall men of the Priestes to whose trust to commit the carriage of it: which when they did, then did they see, how notably God prospered them ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. For so they found, that they had a notably rich offering giuen to the Temple: namely, one hundred and fifty Talents of Siluer, and in Siluer Plate one hundred Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents more; in Gold both one hundred Talents, and twenty fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>re Basins besides, and two other parcels, but whether of Amber, or of some other rare mettall, very faire al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, and as precious as Gold it selfe. A notable and a rare contribution or free-will offering, of those Heathen people towardes the House of God in <hi>Ierusalem;</hi> being, no doubt, mindfull enough (at least, as many be probably conceiued) that it was rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly furnished already by that faire and beautifull Plate, which we may conceiue, came as neere as well they could, to that which <hi>Salomon</hi> in the midst of his glory made for <note place="margin">Ezr. 1: 11 1 Esd. 2: 10-15</note> it before, no lesse than fiue thousand and foure hundred parcels of it, that <hi>Cyrus</hi> had <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> sent home already, all of them being eyther of Gold or Siluer: but a great condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation withall, to those that spoyle the Churches of God of thinges most needfull; or but as vnrighteously with-hold them now, as they were taken away before.

            <p n="9">9 What <hi>Ezra</hi> did there, when thus hee was come, beeing now to bee seene, we are to know, that we haue but part of it in the Story that now wee are in, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> which we haue in the Booke of <hi>Ezra:</hi> but then haue we more in the Booke ensuing, which is intituled to <hi>Nehemiah.</hi> So are we now but onely to consider of that, which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> we haue in this Booke intituled to him: and to take the other where we haue it deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered vnto vs, in the Story of <hi>Nehemiah.</hi> That which we haue heere deliuered vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs, doth some part of it seeme to appertaine to the time of their first comming thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: and some part againe, to the time some-what after. Of that which seemeth to appertaine to the time of their first comming thither, most of it is altogether among themselues: but some part of it, betwixt them and others neere adioyning. That which was among themselues, rested in two principall points: one, the discharging of a point of trust to them committed; the other, a farther duty by them performed. The trust that was to them committed, was, that when they should come to <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem,</hi> then should they make true deliuery of those thinges that were committed vnto them to the vse of the Temple, and of the seruice of God among them: which <note place="margin">Ezr. 8: 32-34 1 Esd. 8: 61-63</note> they truely did, the fourth day after they were returned; taking the meane time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, some-thing to refresh themselues after that long iourney of theirs, and to get those things in some better readinesse against the time that they should be deliuered. A notable patterne for Princes, and all other Patrons of the Church-liuinges: who haue indeede nothing else before God, but onely a trust to them committed to prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue and keepe them to the vse where-unto they were appointed; and then with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out impairing (of that which is due and needfull maintenance) delay, or corruption, to bestow them againe. This had beene a faire booty for <hi>Ezra,</hi> and the chiefe of that company, to haue concealed and shared among them: especially, the Temple being so richly furnished, as by the other it was already. But they haue giuen a better example than so. They did not embolden themselues to be doing with it, because the Temple had enough already: but belike they considered, that what God had thought good to moue the harts of the King, Princes, and people to bestow vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, that were not they to turn aside to other vses, much lesse to pelfer it vnto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues; nor so much as to enuy or thinke much, that the Temple should haue it. We also our selues (so many as are of any moderation at all) doo not thinke much one with another, if it please God to giue vnto any, of earthly blessings, a much greater measure than he giueth to vs: though Noble-men haue many Lordships &amp; honors; and though Princes heue many rich and mightie kingdomes. Those that are but in weake measure endued with godly wisedome, neuerthelesse do not allowe, that any of the greater sort whatsoeuer, should (after the vsuall worldly manner) be: at any time striuing to make them-selues greater, by laying Lord-shippe to Lorde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,

And such moderation ought to be in vs al, one towards another for al such matters: much more in those things that it pleaseth God more plentifully to bestow, towards the aduancement of his glory, and the eternall good of his chosen people. Yet in these things we not onely vse our freedome to censure them as we think good, to appor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion them also, and to mince them at our owne pleasure: but also wee thinke, that therein we may lawfully do it; and that some there are that in duty ought so to do. Not in such sort working on those things that were vniustly, or, any way ill besto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed on the Church (for that is not the case; and there is no question, but that such things may, and ought to be amended) but thus grating at those thinges that came as orderly to the Church, as wee haue any other right in the world: such as good Kings, Nobles, and others, yea, euen whole Synods and Parlaments too, mooued by the good spirit of God, and laying before their eies the example and worde of God himselfe, in good zeale and vprightnesse of heart, to Gods glory, and Soules health of others, did willingly offer vnto the Lord to bee his for euer. So did not these: and beware that they be not condemnation to others. That farther dutie that they performed, is of that nature, that in it also we might doe our selues some wrong, if wee should not but superficially or sleightly consider of it: and yet I trust wee neede no farther than this, first to consider of it as it standeth by it selfe; then, as it is ioyned vnto another.

That other whereunto it was ioyned, was, that their faithfull deliuery of those holy thinges, that were to their trust before committed: of which when in good sort they had discharged themselues, then might religious worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping kindly and orderly follow thereuppon; and when they did not reserue those thinges to their priuate vse, out of which the blessing of GOD was to be deriued to their bretheren also, on that so good a care of their bretheren, they might well <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> woorship for them likewise. But wee, still failing the trust committed vnto vs, and turning to our owne worldly luker, that which by right should bee the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of others nowe, and those no meaner nor lesse needfull, but that by their Ministery much people should bee instructed nowe in the knowledge of God, and afterward led to eternal glory, can neuer truely either giue thanks or pray for them: and, where equity and vp-right dealing goeth not before, there will neuer any sound deuotion followe after. Wee may so gloriously prosesse, and beare such a shew of godlinesse and zeale, as that indeede wee may thereby deceiue others, and our selues too: but so long as we doe so strongly with-hold, but in earthly respect, that which others by right should haue to much better vse, it will bee hard to finde any one ounce of sound deuotion, in great heapes of such profession. In that which was betwixt them, and others adioyning, wee are to note the good successe that now they had. For they did no sooner acquaint the Gouernors and Officers of <note place="margin">Ezr. 7: 36 1 Esdr. 8: 66</note> those parts with that their commission, but that therupon promoted or had in honor not onely the people themselues: but also, which was much harder to them, euen that house of God likewise. We on the other side, haue wrestled long, and stil do, with those that with vs haue beene enemies to our selues and our buildings, euer since wee haue had in hand the building of the house of GOD among vs: and yet neuer obtaine that curtesie of them; nor so much neither, that they would bee but quiet and let vs alone, without their trouble and molestation. But belike they e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spie, that wee go not so kindly about the worke that we pretend, as did those that
<pb n="521" facs="tcp:7530:272"/> now we speak of: belike they note, that we strongly with-hold those holy vessels, (to vs committed) to profane vse still, and daily are embeseling out of the Temple such as were brought home before; and so conclude, that whatsoeuer wee prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, we haue no regard indeede, to builde vp that house of God among vs. So is there, on eyther side, a kind of conclusion implied: on the one side, that wee may still keepe those to our priuate vse, and yet haue it our meaning, well to build vp the house of God too; on the other, they still with-hold thinges that were to them committed, and daily seeke to get into their handes such as were brought home before, and therfore cannot haue it their meaning well to build vp the house that they speake of. Now betwixt these it may well be doubted, that if the latter of these be Logicall indeede; then is the other but Sophisticall onely: a matter for the Reader in that faculty, to thinke vpon, and to determine.</p>
            <p n="10">10 That part of the doings of <hi>Esra;</hi> which seemeth to appertaine to the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> time some-what after ensuing, was about those vnlawfull marriages which many of the people had made since they returned from the Captiuity, before that <hi>Esra</hi>

When wee are to see how ill hee tooke it, we are not onely to marke how hee behaued himselfe thereon: but withall, what may seeme to bee his reason that so hee did. Hee, no doubt, so behaued himselfe thereon, as dooth sufficiently wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, that it was exceeding greeuous vnto him: first, but sorrowing by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe; but then soone after praying to GOD. While hee did but sorrowe with himselfe, we are again there to marke, what his sorrow may seeme to be then: and how farre it wrought with others. His sorrow then dooth very plainely seeme to be great: he so fared with his garments and with his haire; and was so greatly <note place="margin">Ezr 9: 3, 4. 1. Esdr 8: 70, 71.</note> amazed at it. It wrought so with others, that such as feared God among them, did thereuppon repaire vnto him: themselues (belike) being sorrowfull also, that so reuerend a man as he, should be so farre disquieted by any of them. When he set himselfe to pray vnto God, it was at the time of the Euening-Sacrifice of that day when he heard it; not hearing of it, belike, till after the time of the Morning-Sacrifice before: and then going to the Court of the Lordes house, there falling downe on his knees, and stretching forth his handes to the Heauens, hee so made his Prayer to God. Wherein it shall be good that we consider, not onely of the effect of his prayer: but withall, of some circumstances thereunto appertaining. As touching the effect of his prayer, it seemeth, that then hee did not vtter all that be meant: but that some of the company, pittying and sorry to see such a man so vexed by them, and thereby the better perceiuing the foulenesse of their offense therein, made so bold with him, as, after a sort, to intterupt him; professing rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinesse, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> therein to be said and ruled by him.

The time was, the Euening-Sacrifice-time; the place, the house of the Lord: both of them seeming to insinuate, that he had a meaning, in godly wisedome, besides the confessing of the sinne vnto God, in such sort to do it, as most effectually might touch the harts
<pb n="522" facs="tcp:7530:273"/> of the people, especially of those that were the offenders. And to that ende it seemeth likewise, that he rather twineth his speach so as he doth, from the Lorde himselfe to the people then praesent, speaking then of the Lord but in the third <note place="margin">

The reason why it may seeme, that he did take it so ill, was not onely (as I conceiue) the greatnesse of that fault, with all the euils and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conueniences thereto appertaining; but withall, that he was so crossed; as there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he might soone see himselfe to bee, in that good course wherein hee was: and that, both in respect of that▪ which hee had already done; and in respect of that which now he came among them to do. For probably we may conceiue, by that great liberality of the King, his Nobles and people, and both those other sauours besides that the King vouchsafed to <hi>Ezra</hi> (of which we haue already heard) that he had already brought the King in great good opinion of that people, for holinesse, and all good carriage besides, in all their other waies whatsoeuer. Great honour also had he procured to the House of the Lord; and many faire and rich Ornaments to it besides: matters of too great a price, for such degenerate, and mungreell wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippers, as now they were. He meant now to haue deliuered vnto them, some exact knowledge of the Lawe of the Lord: and so to haue raised such a people to God, as should be an ornament of that age, and a patterne to the ages ensuing. But now there is no matter to worke-on: they are so farre degenerate already, that it is impossible to make any such workmanship of them. He meant likewise, what by his industry in teaching them all the Lawe of God, and by the ciuill power that now hee had gotten, to haue brought all the people confining on them, yea and all their Gouournours &amp; great men among them, in some good measure to haue ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> themselues vnto thē, euen in the profession of their Religion. But now had they (and he wist not of it) so abased and corrupted themselues, that in no wise they were any meete people, to haue any such addition vnto them: much lesse, so honourable an augmentation. These or such like, so mainly crossing that speciall good course that he was in, might very well bee a great part of the cause, that hee was so excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly grieued at those ill tidings, and strucken with such astonishment with them. A matter that speaketh plaine <hi>English</hi> to vs, and that goeth not behind the doore to tell vs, that Popish matchings, by such as neuerthelesse professe the Gospell, doe euer lightly bewray all such to be, and for their Issue much more doe bring in, but a mungrell people: neuer but cyphars in the Church of God, and vnworthy the least of those fauours that not onely God, but good Princes also doe sometimes giue forth to the vse of his people; a matter too vntoward, of whom to make any good workmanship, and none of those men to whom others may be ioyned to any edify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of theirs towards God.</p>
            <p n="11">11 That part of this Story which we haue set downe vnto vs as by some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> is all that followeth: and it may wee account to bee set downe vnto vs, not as by <hi>Ezra</hi> himselfe, but as by some other, because in this, <hi>Ezra</hi> doth not speake vnto vs as in his owne person, as he did before; but, as it were some other besides, rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vnto vs more matter of him. The effect whereof is, to shew vnto vs, how ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually it wrought with others, that he tooke this so ill as he did, in that he pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed so earnestly against it: and first, what effect it tooke at that praesent; then, vpon some farther deliberation. At that present it tooke such effect in that company then gathered together, that <hi>Ezra</hi> himselfe might take great comfort in it, and plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly see that God had much blessed his trauell therein: first in respect of that which then was done; then, in respect of the parties that did it. That which then was done, was first no more in effect, but onely (and yet that was much, and a speciall great blessing of God, that it came so readily as it did) that they yeelded confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity vnto him: but then soone after there followed a confirmation or assurance of it by their corporall Oaths. When it was no more but onely a conformity yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vnto him, yet then also came it in very good manner: shewing their readinesse <note place="margin">Ezr. 10: 1-4. 1 Es. 8: 90-94</note>
               <pb n="523" facs="tcp:7530:273"/> vnto it, and encouraging him to set in hand with it. When they yeelded assurance <note place="margin">Ezr. 10: 5 1 Esdr 8▪95 Ezr. 10: 1. 1 Esdr 8: 90 Ezr 10 <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> thereof by their oathes, we finde that <hi>Ezra</hi> now tooke heart to require it of them, and thought it wisedome so to doe: then that the others did as readily yeelde it. As touching those that were parties in these two actions, in the former of them it is noted of all the people generally, that they wept and made great lamentation: otherwise it was in a manner but one man onely, nor hee any of the Priestes and Leuites, but one of the people whose Father also was one of the offenders in the matter now called in quaestion, <hi>Shecaniah,</hi> the Sonne of <hi>Ithiel,</hi> one of the Sonnes of <hi>Elam;</hi> but one whom it pleased God so to blesse in this his good and readie zeale, that it seemeth by that which followed, that they all accorded vnto him, and sure it is, that no body (so farre as we read) stept vp against him. A good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, in such case, for all to bee doing; and not still to tarry on those that should rather doe it: God sometimes not opening the mouths of such at all; but stirring vp more vnlikely persons, yet giuing a speciall blessing vnto them. In the latter of them, it was an <hi>Ezra</hi> that did mooue them vnto it (and such had they neede to bee among vs, men of speciall good reckoning themselues:) and then, euen the chiefe of the Priestes, and of the Leuites, and of the whole people besides, both gentle and simple, did readily yeelde it. A speciall good example to teach vs, how good successe may be expected of an earnest and faithfull prayer: and a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull thing to see, how it pleased God thereupon to bend, euen the harts of them all vnto him. But it cannot lightly be, and in peculier and speciall cases, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in some certaine of them, wherein there may be prayer conceiued in such sort as it ought to be: the case requiring some speciall necessity, that it may bee earnestly craued; and that it bee very agreeable to the will of God (a matter that is not in such particulars so easily found, but when God is disposed by such meanes to effect it: but then dooth he specially raise vp the Spirit of him by whom hee will doe it, to a speciall good hope to obtain it) that so the Praier may be faithfull also. A matter to be the rather marked, that as on the one side we neuer slip the benefit of prayer when occasion is offered: so, on the other, wee doe not lightly attempt it, at the pleasure of others, whereby men haue beene (in their facility and good inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) some-time abused. In the effect that it tooke vpon some farther deliberation, we are to consider, what course it was that then was holden: then how it pleased God to blesse it. The course that then was holden, was partly in <hi>Ezra:</hi> and partly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> in the Princes and chiefe of the people. In <hi>Ezra</hi> we finde, that when he and the <note place="margin">Ezr. 10: 6.</note> rest had done (for that time) with that Seruice of God in the Temple, and had now with-drawne them-selues to some conuenient place, there to take their meate (as it seemeth) and other-wise to refresh themselues, hee neuerthelesse did neyther eate nor drinke with them: but still mourned, for that the people had so grieuously sinned. They had giuen good tokens before, that they meant now to amend it: but belike hee could not yet satifie himselfe therein, for that hee knew their brittlenesse also. It may likewise, that he doubted some speciall wrath of God to be towardes them which he would not reuoke (for so had he dealt with the whole people before) for that which they had already done: notwithstanding <note place="margin">Num 14: 39-45.</note> these tokens of amendment that yet they had giuen. In the Princes and Elders of the people we finde, that they, mooued belike by that sorrowing of <hi>Ezra,</hi> yet continuing, presently made proclamation, both in <hi>Ierusalem</hi> it selfe, and in all the <note place="margin">Ezr. 10: 7, 8.</note> Country besides, that all those that were of the Captiuity, or of their own people among them, should within three dayes repaire to <hi>Hierusalem</hi> to the Princes and Elders there; or other-wise to forfeit all theyr goods; and themselues to bee sepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from their wonted society with all the rest. And truely, euen Princes, and the chiefest Elders of all the people ought to haue speciall good regard to the sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing and vexation in spirit of the better sort among them. <hi>Ezra,</hi> I grant, was a rare man, and a great personage too; and therefore the more to be regarded: but more likely it is, that it was not so much for his great authority wherewith he came furnished vnto them, as for that godly disposition that they saw to be in him, that they had so good regard to that his sorrowing. Hee had indeede good cause to
<pb n="524" facs="tcp:7530:274"/> sorrow: but it may probably seeme, that the godlier sort among vs haue more. His sorrow was, that so many of the people, had so dangeously matched themselues in marriage, with the women of those sinfull nations that dwelt among them: and especially, in respect of that mungrell race, that was in such towardlinesse to bee raised vp therein. Ours may bee, first in the same kinde: then, in another much like vnto it. In the same kinde it is, that so many of our people, Gentle and sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, haue so mingled and matched with the Popish race: and haue thereby (in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of the Faith) such a mungrell seede. The other that is much like vnto it, is, that we see so many of our women, Mothers, Wiues, and Daughters, to be now al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so matched as badly as they be; and this distastfull and pitifull disparagement, still to grow vpon vs more and more, euen in these daies of the Gospell: the alienation <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> I meane of our Church-liuings, such as were the due and needfull maintainance of the Ministery; occasioned by the example of that allowance that God himselfe did set downe to his people of old, and accordingly laid-foorth by our better Elders, than those that since haue so cleane withdrawne them from all Ecclesiasticall vse so much as they haue. For so many of them, as by the helpe whereof wee our selues or any of vs haue beene won to the knowledge of God, wee may well, at least not absurdly, account our Mothers: as by their helpe, borne and brought foorth chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to God. Wiues they were also, in respect of their former marriage to holy vses: and Daughters likewise, in respect of those from whom they descended. There is likewise another grieuous disparagement among vs, of the wonted main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainance and liuings of those, that time out of minde haue beene well imployed in good and needfull labours; which others of the greater sort since haue beene suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to incorporate vnto themselues, eyther to more homely or at least to lesse vse a great deale, than before: to the vtter dispeopling of many Granges and Villages, and of diuers whole Townes besides. Now there is no quaestion, but that the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter sort among vs, in all estates whatsoeuer, doe sorrow at these: as also that our Princes and Elders cannot be ignorant of the sorrow that is heereupon conceiued; at least, that such sorrow there is, though, it may bee, they conceiue not the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse or the bitternesse of it. But whether any due regard hath beene had vnto it, or not, if we refer the deciding thereof, to that which yet hath beene done for the mittigation of it: I nothing doubt, but that this patterne of the Princes and Elders of <hi>Iudah</hi> doth giue vnto vs a farther light than yet we vsed. How it pleased God to blesse this good course of <hi>Ezra,</hi> the Story ensuing doth sufficiently witnes: first, in that which was done at <hi>Ierusalem</hi> at this repaire of the people thither; then, in that which was done there and elsewhere as that their businesse lay, in the three moneths next ensuing. At this repaire of thirs vnto <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> first it is noted, that they orderly came, according to the commandement giuen them: then, that when <note place="margin">Ezr. 10: 9.</note>
               <hi>Ezra</hi> did reproue them for those bad matches of theirs, and required amendment thereof, they readily yeelded thereunto; onely requiring, that whereas it was a <note place="margin">Ezr. 10: 10-14</note> matter that would aske some reasonable time to doe it, and the weather was vnsea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable then, they would take some farther time vnto it, and that it might be inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vpon in their Citties at home, their meaning belike beeing therein, not onely that themselues were not troubled more than neede should be, but also for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> dispatch of the businesse it selfe. That which was done in those three moneths next after ensuing, was the dispatch of the businesse it selfe: wherein also we haue a particular note of many that were offenders therein. The businesse it selfe was, that <hi>Ezra</hi> and certaine of the principall Fathers, together with those that were appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, <note place="margin">Ezr. 10: 15-17</note> in those three months and one day more, going vnto the Citties themselues and sitting there, did make a seperation of all those women and of their children, whom they had so married against the Lawe of God, and was now the matter in quaestion. Such Commissioners, as that, the mo at any time we haue in our need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full causes, that are like vnto them, the more are wee beholding to God for them: the fewer we haue of that kinde, the more may we finde, that certainely God is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended with vs, and doth not meane vs that good as yet; but will rather suffer vs to runne-on still, vntill wee haue filled our measure so full, as more fitly requireth the
<pb n="525" facs="tcp:7530:274"/> stroke of his iustice. As for those vnkindly and hard matches of ours, that before we spoke of, though there be such order taken for those that are of the same kinde as wee may hope will in time doe much good in that matter: yet neyther doe those our Church-liuings (euen where the greatest multitudes are) nor those so many habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the meaner and common people, wherein, time out of mind, their praedeces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors and elders did comfortably passe their daies before, finde themselues so blest, as yet to haue any such Commissioners to them allotted. The offenders that then were <note place="margin">Ezr. 10: 38-44</note> found in that case among the <hi>Iewes,</hi> were not ful-out (as their note is left vs) six score in all: and yet would not <hi>Ezra</hi> (not the rest of the Fathers, when they saw how grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous a thing it was vnto them) suffer those to enioy that place among them. Yet were the <hi>Iewes</hi> that first returned, better than two and forty thousand in all, besides <note place="margin">Ezr. 2: 1-42</note> all such as (by likelihoode) would afterwards be dropping in vnto them. Our Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish-Churches are not found to bee ten thousand in all; but to want some few hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds <note place="margin">Chr. Saxton.</note> thereof: yet were it good newes (as I doe take it) whosoeuer could assure vs, that the number of those that smart by our vnkindly hard matches, were not much greater. The like also, it is not vnlikely, may be conceiued by the other. Those <hi>Iewes</hi> were but seuerall persons: those others of ours, are, one sort of them, of the most populous Parishes of all; and the others, oft-times great companies also. Could we bee in heart indeede inclined to that we professe, it were no matter of any great difficulty, to do exceeding much good therein: and such seruice in these, would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> be thought, any way inferior vnto the other.</p>
            <p n="12">12 Not long after <hi>Ezra,</hi> came <hi>Nehemiah;</hi> and we haue Story of him, that he <note place="margin">Nehemiah</note>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> came thither twice, and both times after this comming of <hi>Ezra:</hi> but wee haue no Story at all of him before, when the first company of the <hi>Iewes</hi> returned vnder <hi>Zoro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babell.</hi> So that although he be there also named, as one of the chiefe of those that <note place="margin">Ezr. 2: 2.</note> then returned (as we saw before:) yet doth no part of the Story that now we haue of him, appertaine to that time, but onely to the time that now we speake of. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer of those two times that he came to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> was, about thirteene yeares after the comming of <hi>Ezra (Ezra</hi> comming thither in the seauenth, and <hi>Nehemiah</hi> in the twentieth yeare of the same King) and vnto this his former comming thither, dooth <note place="margin">Ezr. 7: 8. Neh. 1: 1.</note> appertaine the most of his Story: first shewing vs, in what sort he now came thither; then, how he was occupied when he was there. That now he came thither, it was vpon a speciall occasion giuen him: and so are wee to consider, first of the occasion that so was giuen him; then, how himselfe followed vpon it. The occasion that was <note place="margin">Neh. 1: 1. 2: 1</note> giuen him, was, that certaine of his bretheren that came from <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> vpon his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring of the estate of the people there, gaue him to vnderstand, that the estate of <note place="margin">Neh. 1: 2, 3</note> the people there was yet very hard: and withall gaue him in some such particulars, as out of which himselfe might be able plainely to see it. The he inquired of the estate of his bretheren, hee hath giuen a good example to vs to doe the like. Hee was an Officer in Court, and in speciall fauour with the King: and so though our selues bee well, yet should we remember those that are not. That <hi>Ierusalem</hi> also was in so hard case as yet, hauing such fauours as already it had, may bee a sufficient notice and war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to all, especially to such as are in Authority, how hardly the Church of God (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once brought downe) getteth vp againe, vnlesse it be specially holpen, with rare and extraordinary fauour. The particulars were, that the people were in reproach: and that <hi>Ierusalem</hi> it selfe lay open to the enemy, without eyther Gates, or Walles. The reproach that they were in seemeth to be, that the peoples and Nations among whom they dwelt, did vpbraid them with their misery and weaknesse, as seruing such a God, as eyther was not able to doe them good, or did make no reckoning of them. So when Princes and the great men of the world, do not yeeld conuenient and need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full helpe, to raise vp the Church againe being once decayed, they leaue the faithfull <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> to the open reproach of all about them: whether knowne enemies, or no more but false bretheren onely. But the matter is strange, that <hi>Ezra</hi> comming downe with so great Authority so few yeares before, the people and the Citty were yet in so piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full case as they were. We haue not the Story whereupon we may account should
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:7530:275"/> arise so great a change in the daies of one and the selfe-same Prince: so well minded when he sent downe <hi>Ezra</hi> in the seauenth yeare of his raigne; and so well minded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine when he sent downe <hi>Nehemiah</hi> thirteene yeares after. And needs it must be, that there was some speciall bad accident in it: but such is oft-times the estate of the people of God; one deepe calling another. But though wee haue no Story of it; yet haue we Story of that which may probably seeme to haue giuen a good part of the occasion of it: namely, that by the meanes of <hi>Ezra,</hi> they did so abandon from them, both the women of those peoples whom before they had married, and the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren they had borne vnto them. For this, if we marke it, was such a matter, as might very sore nettle all the people among whom they were placed; and, with most men, much sinke the credit of <hi>Ezra</hi> besides: and then lesse maruell, if thereupon they all sent vp to the King against him; and that the King and his Counsell, not thinking so well of him now as they did before, reuoked the Authority which before they had giuen him, and thought the worse of all the <hi>Iewes</hi> too. For it might seeme to all that people, that this was for that praesent a very hard and vnneighbourly part: and that for the time to come, they might neuer looke for any good neighbour-hood or friendship of them. There might be also of the people of God themselues that might hardly censure him therein, and that whole action: first, as being done cleane out of season; then, as being more too, than absolutely was at any time needfull. It might seeme to be done cleane out of season, for that he had such Authority to teach them all, and to punnish those that should disobey: teaching first, being (in all wisedome) to go before all such actions, as by the ignorance of any might be offensiue. Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe also might see, that he could not so deale in that matter, but to the offense of all those peoples: and that those, of whom hee had all those great fauours so lately be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, were not themselues so well acquainted with the necessity of any such dealing, but that if those peoples should thereupon desire them to bethinke themselues, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he were such a man as they tooke him to be, it might very well hazzard all those sauours that now he had gotten. And then; how much better had it beene for him first to haue dispatched all such thinges as were of speciall importance among them, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> while he had beene teaching them withall the necessity of that other: and, when hee had both dispatched those, and shewed the needfulnesse of the other too, then to haue set in hand with that matter? It might seeme likewise that it was more than at any time was absolutely needfull, first by some practice they had among them: then, by the nature of the inhibition it selfe whith for that matter was giuen them. Their practice was, first of sparing the <hi>Gibeonites,</hi> who by the vertue of that inhibition <note place="margin">Iosh. 9: 18, 19</note> should not haue beene suffered to liue among them: then, of <hi>Salmon</hi> that married <hi>Rahab</hi> a <hi>Canaanite,</hi> and of <hi>Booz</hi> that married <hi>Ruth</hi> of the <hi>Moabites;</hi> yet did not after put them and their children away, but, in processe of time, had Christ by them. The nature of the inhibition it selfe seemeth not to bee such, as might in no wise haue <note place="margin">Mat. 1: 5.</note> beene broken: but onely made for their good, and to haue giuen them both ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uise what was best for them to doe; and thereby to allow them so to haue done. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise wee see not how the people might haue kept their league with the <hi>Gibeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites:</hi> neyther could wee finde the sinne of <hi>Saule</hi> (in destroying certaine of them <note place="margin">2 Sam. 21: 1</note> after) to bee so great, as the punnishment of the whole Land three yeares together for it, did shew it to bee. That <hi>Ezra</hi> had a very good purpose, and meaning with him, when hee came among them, there is no quaestion; nor that now this doing of his proceeded of a godly zeale: but it may bee, that as Christ commended the ill Steward, that hee made shift in time, but not the manner of it; so in the doings of <hi>Ezra</hi> now, the prosecuting of that his good meaning and zeale, in that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar that now, wee speake of, it may well bee, was not so answerable to that his good meaning and zeale as was to bee wished. Howsoeuer it was, wee see that the case was with the <hi>Iewes</hi> altered now: the estate of them beeing so very pitifull, and yet both the selfe same good King that gaue <hi>Ezra</hi> so great Authority both liuing and raigning aswell as before; and <hi>Ezra</hi> himselfe liuing yet, and as it seemeth (for there wee finde him shortly after) beeing at <hi>Ierusalem</hi> also. That <note place="margin">Neh. 8: 1.</note> these strangers doe farther tell <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> that the Wall of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> was bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="527" facs="tcp:7530:275"/> downe, and the Gates burnt with fire, and this seemed so strange to <hi>Nehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah,</hi> and that now he was so affected with it: it seemeth thereby, that they doe not speake of them as they were left hy <hi>Nebucadnezzer</hi> before; but rather, that they had some-thing repaired them since they returned, but that theyr Enemies would not suffer the same to stand. There is a plaine Testimony (though not so vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted authority) that the same <hi>Darius</hi> who was of the <hi>Medes,</hi> and came in with <note place="margin">1 Esdr. 4: 43, 47, 48.</note>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
               <hi>Cyrus</hi> to the Conquest of <hi>Babylon,</hi> first himselfe vowed to builde <hi>Hierusalem;</hi> and soone after gaue speciall charge, that it should bee done: and else-where it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, by vndoubted authority, that the same <hi>Darius</hi> did make great reckoning of <hi>Daniell;</hi> and was well perswaded of the true God too, whom <hi>Daniell</hi> worshipped, <note place="margin">Dan. 6: 1-3, 14, 16, 25-27</note> and whose Citty peculiarly <hi>Hierusalem</hi> was. But by reason it selfe we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, that comming home there to dwell, there would they likewise builde or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire not onely some houses to dwell in, but their Wals and Gates likewise after a sort, such as vrgent necessity did most require: and seeing they were by authority allowed, there againe to inhabit, it is a necessary appendant thereunto, that that there also they were allowed to haue reasonable defensiue helpes, though not of power to make any speciall resistance (which would be suspicious) yet such as was needefull for conuenient habitation; and seeing wee finde not that inhibited vnto them, wee neede not to doubt, but that so farre some-times they were do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing though the Enemies also would bee as ready to ruinate all againe, so oft as they might. So it seemeth, that it was of such breaking downe of the Wall, and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Gates of the Citty, that those did now speak of; rather then of that which was doone so many yeares before, as of which no body could bee so igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, nor haue the force of their affections so durable, as to thinke so strange, and to take it so heauily, as <hi>Nehemiah</hi> nowe is noted to haue doone: as if theyr mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning were to let him vnderstand, that theyr Bretheren were yet so trodden downe of the people about them, that neyther Wall nor Gate could yet stand for them, but that still they brake downe the one, and burnt the others. But I am not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, that others there are of speciall account, that doe other-wise take it. This occasion beeing giuen him, and wee beeing now to see, how hee followed <note place="margin">Lyr. Conr, Pel. Tremel. Iun.</note> thereuppon, first wee finde, that hee was occupyed about that hard estate of theirs that now they were in: then, about some remedy for it. That which hee did about that praesent estate of theyrs was, that hee sorrowed for it, and did much la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <note place="margin">Neh. 1: 4.</note> the same: a good example to vs, that so farre as our case is like vnto theyrs, we also should doe the like. For our <hi>Hierusalem</hi> also is not yet so fortifyed, by strength of Lawes, and by concurrence of authority with them, but that in some thinges of speciall moment, wee may finde good cause to bee heartily sorry. To obtaine a remedy for it, wee are to consider, what course hee taketh: and how hee speedeth. The course that hee taketh, was first with God; then, with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> the King: and this hee dooth twice. In the former, vnto GOD, first hee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth his Justice therein: but then withall desireth his helpe; and euen to <note place="margin">Ibid. 4-11.</note> obtaine the fauour of him, whose fauour his place it selfe might witnesse, that he had in good measure already. So should we first seeke vnto God: and not onely when other-wise wee haue no hope; but euen in the best hopes that wee other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise haue. When hee was to deale with the King, first himselfe gaue some occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion vnto the purpose hee had in hand; and, as it seemeth, not of set purpose nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but that hee could not other-wise doe. For it was by the sadnesse of his <note place="margin">Neh. 2: 1:</note> countenance, which it seemeth hee could not dissemble, no not in the Kinges pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, though faine hee would for feare of displeasure. But fewe there are of vs, that so take to heart the hard estate of the Church, but that wee can easily put on a good and cheerefull countenance whensoeuer wee will: and yet, of one and the selfe-same body, when one member is payned indeede, all the other members, lesse or more, doe suffer with it. A matter so much the sooner espyed in him, for that it was not his manner before to be sadde in his praesence: a very good token, of a good member of the Church, that would so easily digest the discontentments of
<pb n="528" facs="tcp:7530:276"/> Court; and yet on the behalfe of <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> could in no wise put it of, but must needes be so heauy. Then, when by occasion heereof the King asked him of the cause of it, he plainely tould him, that it was because the chiefe Citty of his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue <note place="margin">Ibid. 2, 3.</note> Countrey, in which likewise the Sepulchres of his Fathers were, could as yet haue no wals but they must be ruinated, nor any gates but they must be burned. In the latter, when the King thereupon did aske him what was the thing that he desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, <note place="margin">Ibid. 4.</note> hee first againe prayed to God, before he laid forth his suite to the King. He sped so well, that whereas he besought the King, if so it might stand with his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, <note place="margin">Ibid. 5-8. 5: 14</note> to graunt him, by the helpe of his Officers and Captaines in those parts, both safe conduct for his owne passage thyther, and to be furnished with thinges neede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full when he came there: the King did readily grant him all his owne desire there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; and withall both made him Gouernour of <hi>Iudea,</hi> and sent certaine Captaines and Horse-men with him for his better safety in the way, and belike to doe him that honour in the sight of others. All which <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> looking vppe, higher than so (as in such case wee all should doe) attributeth to the good hand of God <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> vppon him. In the way as hee went, hee acquainted the Gouernours of those partes with the graunt of the King, that so farre as to any of them should apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine <note place="margin">Neh. 2: 9, 10.</note> to be assistant vnto the businesse hee had in hand, they might so perceiue, what was the Kinges pleasure for them to doe: and two of them hee found to bee much grieued, that there was a man come, which sought the health of the Children of <hi>Israell; Samballat</hi> the one, and <hi>Tobiah</hi> the other, the former of them beeing the Gouernor of the <hi>Moabites,</hi> the latter of the <hi>Ammonites,</hi> and both those peoples being neere on the East to the Land of <hi>Iury.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="13">13. Beeing so come to <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> and wee beeing now to see what <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> he did there, soone may we see, that first he imployed himselfe to hold out the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my: and then to get the people in good order at home. The better to holde out the Enemy, hee now at this praesent thought good to get the Citty fensed: and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward was carefull, to haue it better peopled also. That it might bee fensed, first hee endeuoured to get the Walles repayred, and the Gates to bee like-wise renewed: then, to be well and orderly kept. To get the Walles repayred, and the Gates to bee againe renewed, that so Hierusalem might bee fortifyed, it is not vnlikely, but that himselfe did see, that it was a woorke of that Nature, as that the Enemies would bee much greeued at it, and therefore hinder it so much as they could. That the people had theyr beeing there, and there did exercise their Religion, it was not so greeuous a thing vnto them, so long as they lay so open withall, that when they would, they might haue beene on them: but now so to bee fortified, that afterward they could not hope, to haue so open a way to wreake theyr wrath vppon them so oft as they would, that goeth sore against the Wooll with them. So may wee see it, with vs too: that Religion may be profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and the due maintenance of the Ministery for the time, in some measure yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, when Superiors will needes so haue it; but, by strength of Law to bee so for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified, that when they would they might not impeach it, that can many in no wise like of. This that hee might the better doe, for a while at the first wee finde, <note place="margin">Ibid. 11-12</note> that hee kepr himselfe close: but afterward hee shewed himselfe plainely enough. In that he kept himselfe close, comming vnto them, it may seem, but onely as a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate man, and for a time not imparting vnto them what he meant to doe, wee may reasonable plainely see, that hee did not altogether after the manner of the great men of the World, comming to Hierusalem in so priuate manner as it seemeth hee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> did. Others lightly are close enough all, if they haue any secret purpose with them: but few there be, who at their first comming would not haue the honor done vnto them which in such case they might, &amp; account to be due to the person they bear. Yet is it for the most part seene, that such as least seeke to be honoured of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, doe neuerthelesse most good vnto them; and so deserue most honor of them: Christ himselfe afterward cōming thither also, in much more priuate estate than, he
<pb n="529" facs="tcp:7530:276"/> and a great deale more meanely; but blessing them with euerlasting peace, and deseruing much more honour of them, than they could yeelde him. But while hee kept him-selfe so close, hee by night, and hauing but few with him, secret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">Ibid. 12-16.</note> viewed the ruines of the Citty and Breaches of the Wals: doing it secretly, and hauing so few with him therein, it might very well bee, eyther of wisedome; or of modesty, or of both. In wisedome hee might doubt, that Enemies had theyr Spyes among them: in modesty, it is very likely, hee could not make shew of doing any thing, till he did it indeede. And wee see by experience, as rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son also plainely teacheth, that such haue readyest dispatch of theyr businesse, that can best keepe it from theyr Enemies knowledge: and that such as talke most of what they will doe, least of all doe it; the greatest part belike of their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose beeing spent in a few wordes, and so hauing little remaining to bee spent in deedes. He shewed himselfe plainely enough when hee had in seceet viewed in what case those thinges were, that were of them to be repayred. Which when he did, then are wee to see, not onely how him-selfe dealt with them about this matter: but what it was also, that on all handes was thereupon doone. His dealing with them was, that first hee did put them in minde of theyr praesent mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable <note place="margin">Neh. 2: 17, 18</note> and reproachfull estate in that they saw that Citty of theyrs, the Head-Citty of all the Land, euen the Citty of GOD himselfe, to lye so wast, and so open to the spoyle of all; and then, both acquainted them with that speciall opportunity of helping themselues therein that GOD now had giuen them; and mooued them to buckle themselues vnto it. That which was on all hands thereupon done, was for a time without interruption or trouble: but then soone after they hadde some businesse withall. Without interruption or trouble it was, that praesentlie vppon that good newes and motion of his, they set in hand with it: and diuiding <note place="margin">Ibid. 18. and 3▪ <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>-32.</note> themselues into seuerall companyes, as to such purpose was meetest, they were building round about the Citty all at once. How long they were so occupyed, and how farre they raysed theyr building before they were interrupted or troubled <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> therein, we cannot tell: but it is most likely, that such as were so grieued, that any man should bee carefull for the good estate of the people, would also haue such an eye vnto them, as that they could not bee long about so needefull businesse as it, but that they would quickly be with them. And wee haue it plainely set downe; that at certaine times they did trouble them indeede: but themselues began to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of them. They troubled them first, while the wals were yet but in building: then againe, when they were builded. While the wall was yet but in building, we finde that they troubled them before it came to halfe the heigth of them: and then againe before the residue of them was finished. Before the wals came to halfe theyr height, we find that they troubled them twice. For first <hi>Samballat, Tobiah,</hi> &amp; <hi>Geshem</hi>
               <note place="margin">Neh. 2: 19, 20</note> the Kings Deputies ouer the <hi>Moabites, Amonites,</hi> &amp; the <hi>Arabians,</hi> first, as it seemeth by the aunswere that <hi>Nehemiah</hi> gaue them, made shew, as if they also would haue holpen them: but when that would not bee accepted, then both they would haue made them belieue, that without their help they could neuer do it, and both mocked them as not building to any purpose, and yet in their owne weake conceites as if by the strength thereof they might be able to stand, euen against the King himselfe. But <hi>Nehemiah</hi> making no reckoning of those their scornings, and directing his answer but to such points as were materiall, doth plainely tell them, that in trust that God wil prosper them, they wilbe doing: but as for them they had nothing to do in that busines, neither did they belong vnto it. Then againe we find, that when <hi>Samballat</hi>
               <note place="margin">Neh. 4: 1-5.</note> and <hi>Tobiah</hi> were on a time together, and, as it seemeth, but at <hi>Samariah,</hi> much neerer to the Iewes than theyr owne Countryes were, and there hauing an Army too (but to what purpose wee doe not finde) they, both of them scorned at the Iewes building, as neuer able to bee of any force, not so much as to beare the force or weight of a Foxe, if he should happen to leape vp thereon. At which time we finde that <hi>Nehemiah</hi> turned him-selfe to prayer: yet not as it seemeth in feare of that Army, but against those bitter scornes of theirs. As wee also di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers times see that the forces of the Enemies of the Gospell are nothing so fearfull,
<pb n="530" facs="tcp:7530:277"/> as their scornings, being against the truth, are bitter to those that themselues doe loue it. Immediately after both which Stories it followeth, that by this time the <note place="margin">Ibid. 6.</note> Walles were ioyned and reared vp to halfe the heigth of them. Before the rest of the Walles were f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>nished, we find not onely that their enemies were brogging at them: but also that there was such an hinderance among themselues, as in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> might well haue impeached the finishing of them. The enemies wee speake of, were first those two Captaines againe last remembred: then also certaine peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples <note place="margin">Ibid. 7-23.</note> ioyning with them, the <hi>Arabians</hi> and <hi>Ammonites,</hi> and part of the <hi>Philistims</hi> (such as were of the Citty of <hi>Ashbod.)</hi> All which were determined secretly on the suddaine to rush in vpon the builders and to slay them, and so to make the work to cease: the fortifying of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> being such a thing as the enemies can neuer brooke. But the <hi>Iewes</hi> getting vnderstanding of their intent, first sought vnto God, and then so prouided for them, that the others thought it would be to hot a peece of seruice for them to attempt: and so gaue it ouer, thinking it better sport of the two, to sleepe in an whole skin, if so they might. At which time it is good to marke, that the <hi>Iewes</hi> were faine to stand to their defense when they were fortify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> the one halfe of them to be armed, ready to receiue the enemie, the others also that in the mean while builded, yet to build but with the one hand one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and to haue their weapon in the other: but that so taking courage vnto them, and buckling themselues, in that quarrell to cope with their enemies if needes they would, their enemies then were quiet enough, and would not meddle. Both which in these daies experience hath often renewed vnto vs: namely, that such Kingdomes or other States as take with the Gospell, must also prouide against the enemie; but that so doing, their enemies then grow wily enough to looke ere they leap.</p>
            <p n="14">14 That hinderance that was among themselues, that in reason might wel haue <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> impeached the finishing of this work among them, was certaine hard dealing of the greater sort with the meaner: many of the people beeing by it discouraged, till it was by <hi>Nehemiah</hi> amended. In the hard dealing that heere is noted, it shall bee good to consider, not onely what is reported of it: but also to what ende there is such remmbrance of it heere. That which is reported of it, resteth in two principall pointes: one, that the people complained, that it lay very sore vpon them; the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to note whence it came vnto them. In that they did so much complaine that it lay very hard vpon them, and yet the burthen (it seemeth) was no greater but onely the hundreth part of the loane for one month, which commeth no higher but onely to twelue or thirteene in the hundred (but others there are, that do otherwise take it) such as are in Authority are to take good heede, that so neere as may bee, there be no such oppression among their people. And seeing this was so grieuous vnto them, and did so sore ouerlay them, when it came vnto them but onely from <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> the richer sort among them, and not from him which was then in chiefe Authority vnder the King, which at that time was <hi>Nehemiah</hi> himselfe: then, any people must of necessity be much more grieued, or borne downe with such burthens, when be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the toleration of those, euen their Deputies themselues, lie heauy vpon them. For so is it their manner sometimes to do, and to account it a needfull point of wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome too, that thereby making them vnable to stir, they may afterward impose vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them whatsoeuer hard measure they shall thinke good, &amp; haue the others quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to take it: in which case the people, howsoeuer they might haue preuented the other before, or at that praesent might turne a-side from it; yet this kind of burthen can they in no wise auoid, but needs must beare it how vnable soeuer they are to do it. That there is such remenbrance of this hard dealing heere, it may likewise giue vs to vnderstand, that such thinges tolerated in the richer sort of the people, and immoderate impositions from higher Authority also, may, wheresoeuer they come together, much more hinder the fortifying of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> in any of our Christiā king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes likewise, and therefore no maruell, if the course of the Gospell doe not in such places so effectually proceede as were to bee wished; especially there, where
<pb n="531" facs="tcp:7530:277"/> impositions (though smart enough in them-selues) were notwithstanding but an easier burthen, so that the things, themselues remaine, out of which they were to be raised. In that <hi>Nehemiah</hi> did goe so readily about to amend it, first it argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that he did thinke it a mattet needfull to bee amended▪ then, because wee see that he did it, it shall bee good to marke what course hee obserued therein. That he did thinke it needfull to be amended, is not (I graunt) of force to inferre, that we should be of that opinion also: but yet it is a faire warning to vs to take heede, that his dutifull regard in that matter, be no iust condemnation to any carelesnes of ours therein. The course that he obserued therein, is, that first hee was much grieued at it: and then did labour to haue it reformed. In that he was much grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued <note place="margin">Neh. 5: 6.</note> at it, both it was a good token that hee was a good Magistrate: and yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded withall good hope of amendment. And yet it may not be denyed, but that he might seeme vnto some, to bee ouer-populer therein: yet not iustly but onely to such, as would rather allow much more than needeth vnto the greater, than very needefull vnto the meaner. When he laboured ro haue it performed, first hee dealeth with the partyes whom it concerned: then hee entereth into some speciall consideration of his owne wayes in such matters, belike to cleere him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe in his owne conscience, that in this matter hee did not lay a greater burthen <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> on others than himselfe did beare as well as they. Dealing with the parties whom it concerned, first he endeuoureth to obtaine their good will therein: then, after that once he had obtained, he laboureth to confirme them in it. When he laboreth to obtaine their good will in it, it is not in vaine, for that they very well did yeeld vnto him. So first how he did deale with thē in it: then how far they yeelded vnto him. His dealing with them was at two seuerall times, in eyther of them praeuay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling some-what with them: first striking them mute, so that they held their peace; then obtaining what he desired. When he did but so charge them, that they had <note place="margin">Neh 5: 7, 8.</note> nothing to answere, he both reprooued, euen the chiefest and greatest of them for that they had done: and, the more to conuince them, he both set before them, as it seemeth, a great number of those with whom they had dealt so hardly; &amp; his own better example. An happy man, in the meane season, that could so do. When it so <note place="margin">Ibid. 9-11.</note> fell out in the end, that he obtained what he desired, againe first he reproueth them, and commendeth an example of his vnto them: and then requireth, but by entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, what he desired. At which time they yeelded fully vnto him: a rare example <note place="margin">Ibid 12.</note> if we marke it, and seldome to be matched among vs all; our priuate lucre, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer we get it▪ euer hath that interest in vs. When now they haue thus far yeelded, <note place="margin">Ibid. 12, 13.</note> then to confirme them in it, both hee tooke oath of them, or at least of certaine of them: and withall pronounced a solemne cursse to so many of them as should refuse to doe as themselues had promised now; with a great and generall applause of all the company. Entering into the consideration of his owne wayes du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the time hee was Gouernour there, and to this ende, as it seemeth, that hee might better cleere his conscience towardes God, in that which now hee requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of the chiefe men among them, first he meditateth of those his waies by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe: and then directeth his speach vnto God. In that his Meditation by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, <note place="margin">Ibid. 14, 15.</note> first he considereth as it were but simply, that he had not beene so chargea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vnto them, as by the example of other Gouernours hee might haue beene: then by comparison, that though his charges were greater than theyrs, yet had <note place="margin">Ibid. 16-18.</note> had hee not taken the benefite of that aduantage. When hee dooth it but sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply in it selfe, his reason is, for that he feared GOD. When hee dooth it by way of comparison, because of the greater charges that hee was at, more than they, both in fortifying some part of the Wall himselfe, and in more chargea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble House-keeping besides, his reason then is in commiseration of the people, as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> beeing brought ouer-low already. A notable patterne for all Gouernours of Prouinces whatsoeuer: both in his whole course generally; and in certaine parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars besides. In his whole course generally wee finde, that hee was very carefull for the good of the people: and that he would not bee chargeable vnto them. Whereas for the most part the good of the people is not by such much regarded:
<pb n="532" facs="tcp:7530:278"/> and yet themselues are very chargeable to them notwithstanding; as obtaining a people on whom they may prey at their own pleasure. Those particulars are, some of them such as do concerne but eyther himselfe, or else his company: and one that doth concerne them both. That which concerneth himselfe, is, that albeit the other Gouernours before him had giuen him example, or made him a ready way to large allowance: yet hee, fearing GOD, could not follow theyr steppes therein. Many of ours thinke, that they can feare God well enough for theyr purpose: and yet be so farre from remitting any thing that was wont to bee had; that they thinke they bestirre themselues but ill, if they doe not yet raise it higher. That which concerneth his company, is, that whereas the Seruaunts of other Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours did rule ouer the people, hee suffered not his so to doe: but brought them all to the woorke that then they had in hand. Notwithstanding which good example of his, it is a wonder to see, how imperious ouer the people, and how deepely exacting of them, not onely the Bretheren, Kinsfolke, and Friendes, but euen the basest of the Seruants also, of many of our Gouernours and diuers other Officers can bee: especially so oft as theyr Lordes and Maysters haue not a good eye vnto them for all such matters; or (which too too often is theyr case in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede) that those Maysters of theirs doe not themselues maintaine them in that seruice of theyrs, but let them haue their countenance onely to prey vpon others, and some-times sell them those roomes besides, yea euen at an excessiue and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilesse rate. That one that did concerne both him and his company, was, that none of them were any Purchasers, or bought any Land: a point that seemeth to be cleane abandoned by most of ours (whether they bee Gouernours or Officers themselues, or but their attendants) and to be left as a point of notable folly; all of them in a manner, chusing rather therein to be like to <hi>Gehazie,</hi> euen to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining <note place="margin">2 King. 5: 20</note> of his Leprosie too, than to be so grosly ouer-seene, as in their iudgement <hi>Nehemiah</hi> heere was. Yet is it no rare thing, neuerthelesse right worthy the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, to see, howe, if the Gouernour, or Officer himselfe, be a man of that bent, and in such sort leadeth before, then, all his retinue doth follow after: euery fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lower <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> hartily shaming in that course not to hang on; if nor to the formost of all, yet at the least vnto his immediate leader. Directing his speech vnto God, hee, <note place="margin">Neh, 5: 19</note> desireth him to remember him in goodnesse, according as hee had beene sincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly carefull on behalfe of his people: both a good token, that he had done his part sincerely indeede, when as hee so pleaded to God him-selfe; and a comfortable example to shew, howe readily wee may haue recourse vnto God, so many as haue had any speciall care of his people heere, and haue dealt truely therein.</p>
            <p n="15">15 When the wals were now builded, and the Gates not yet set vp, the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> trouble that then was, was chiefely to <hi>Nehemiah</hi> himselfe: partly by his enemies; and partly by diuers of his owne people. In the trouble that hee had by his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, hee first relateth the same vnto vs: then he turneth his speech vnto God. As he relateth the same vnto vs, we finde the trouble that was intended against him, was first, by moe of his Enemies together: then, by one of them onely. When it was by moe of them together, as by those three Captaines before mentioned, and others with them, theyr deuise was then, to intice him foorth among <note place="margin">Neh. 6: 1-4</note> them, and then, hauing him there, to doe him some mischiefe: but <hi>Nehemiah</hi> did refuse to come at them, in respect of his businesse he had at home (as also it is both best and safest for vs too, euer to sticke fast to our businesse;) and so persisted vnmooueable, though foure seuerall times they sent about it, very desirous to haue had that Collop, if by any meanes they could haue it. When it was but by one, which was <hi>Saballat,</hi> the ceefe man among them, hee also sought to get him foorth, and belike to the same ende that before, but nowe shewing <note place="margin">Ibid. 5-9.</note> some cause why: but <hi>Nehemiah</hi> made no reckoning thereof, but counted them as vaine &amp; false allegations, and so refused to come vnto him; and giueth his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of these their dooings, that they were done to fray him and the rest, that so they might be discouraged to proceede in their building. When hee turneth hys
<pb n="533" facs="tcp:7530:278"/> speech vnto God, it is, that God would strengthen him against all such discourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments <note place="margin">Ibid. 9.</note> whatsoeuer: the way that all the people of God haue in all their necessities, and much more ready and sure, than any of the children of the world haue of those that they best like of, and where-unto in their distresse they flie. Of his own peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> we read of diuers that were badde members to such a purpose, and no doubt wrought no little trouble vnto him in this his businesse: but yet haue we this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt them, that of some of them we haue relation what hurt they dyd; of the residue no more, but that they were such as might wel be accounted dangerous members. Those of whom we haue relation what hurt they did, were certayne that were endued with the spirit of prophesie, or at least so professed: and of these we haue some Story, before we haue relation made howe the worke was finished. So first of their Story: then of the finishing of that his busines. The effect of their Story is, that he was so troubled by one of them, that he prayeth against those that did set him on worke: and against the others much like vnto him. That one by whom he was so troubled, was <hi>Shemaiah</hi> a Prophet, who woulde haue put him in <note place="margin">Neh. 6: 10-13</note> feare: but <hi>Nehemiah</hi> would not; and then perceiued that <hi>Shemaiah</hi> was hyered by <hi>Samballat</hi> and <hi>Tobie,</hi> so to worke on him, thereby to bring some reproch vnto him. Praying against those two Captaines that woulde haue brought that shame vppon <note place="margin">Ibid. 14.</note> him, he then also together with them putteth <hi>Noadiah</hi> by name, a Prophetesse al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, and other Prophets too, all endeuouring to haue put him in feare. As touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">Ibid 15, 16.</note> the finishing of that his businesse, he recordeth vnto vs, that notwithstanding those impediments it was in good time dispatched: and that all their enemies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them were now affraid, because they sawe that it was of God, that the Iewes had so good successe in it. Those others of whom wee haue no other storie, but onely such as well may conuince them to haue beene dangerous members, were as it seemeth for the most part of them that were of any note, but onely of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: but it is noted, that there were many of them; and then we may be sure, that there were some store of the others too, though we haue none others named. But in the story of these also, we haue one such matter noted withall, as might well be some trouble to <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> and may seeme, though it be not certaine, that it came by their meanes also. Of those Princes, and such others as were of that sorte (if there were any moe, as it is most likely there were) it is noted, that they had much enter course with <hi>Tobiah</hi> aforesaide, or on his behalfe, both by letters, and by word of mouth too. When it is noted, that it was by Letters, there are two Reasons <note place="margin">Neh. 6: 17, 18</note> thereof giuen: one, that many were sworne vnto him; the other, that he was of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finity with certaine of them. When it was but by worde of mouth, there it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
               <note place="margin">Ibid. 19.</note> that euen in the presence of <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> they spake good of him: and reported to him againe whatsoeuer <hi>Nehemiah</hi> by such occasion did at any time deliuer of him. That other matter which we haue noted withall, which might be some tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> and may seeme to come by their meanes too, was that <hi>Tobiah</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ibid. 19.</note> likewise did seeke to put him in feare, by certaine Letters that hee sent vnto him. Out of which we also may learne (as in this land we haue had experience, in these dayes of ours, in plentifull measure) that when Christian Princes endeuour to forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie their <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> there will be euen Prophets, or such as are of some specyall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of wisedome, or of prudent fore-sight of dangers ensuing, that will cast per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rils, and put in feare; such also as are sworne to the enemy, haue intelligence wyth him, and speake good of him till he may come and spread his net ouer vs: and that of all others, such as haue affinitie with the enemy (as many of ours haue for euer and a day wedded to that vsurper of Rome) are in such case, and for such practises, most to be doubted.</p>
            <p n="16">16 The wals being now all repaired, and the gates in their places renu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> and set vp, his next care was, to haue those gates orderly kept; and shortly after the Citie to be better peopled also: these wauls likewise and gates would he haue, in some solemne and publike manner, to be dedicated vnto the Lorde. Al which are so neere of kin the one to the other, as that we might looke, that in course of histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="534" facs="tcp:7530:279"/> they should followe immediatly, and each one of them after another: but so they doe not. That the Gates bee orderly kept, hee taketh care praesently, soone after that they were erected: but then, aduising himselfe next, of getting the Citty better peopled, the Story twineth, as it were, a-side to other matters first; and then afterward commeth both to the peopling of the Citty, and to the dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the wals now lately erected. For the orderlie keeping of the Gates, it followeth immediatly after, that ste committed the opening of them in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and the shutting vppe of them at night againe, vnto certaine men of spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall <note place="margin">Neh. 7: 1-3.</note> trust: and appointed Warders besides throughout the Citty. When he next aduised him-selfe of getting the Citty peopled, the Story continueth in this course but a while: but, like to a Riuer that sometimes leaueth the wonted chanel, and a good while holdeth that new course, before it returne to the wonted chanel againe; so doth this Story now take vnto it another course than wherein it first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, and yet aftet returneth vnto it againe. For hitherto it hath gone in the name of <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> him-selfe all this while speaking vnto vs in his owne person; and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> so yet goeth it a little farther: but then altogether it leaueth that course, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though diuers times after it speaketh of him (thrice out of quaestion in plaine <note place="margin">Ne. 8: 10. 10: 1 12▪ 26.

So may wee take most of this that commeth betwixt, as a kinde of digression: and so are wee first to consider of it; then of the residue, when the Story commeth to that his former course againe. VVhile it is yet for a time in the former course, as before I no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, <note place="margin">Neh. 7: 4, 5</note>
               <hi>Nehemiah</hi> first noteth that the Citty was large, and the people but fewe: then, casting how to amend it, hee acknowledgeth that GOD did shewe him a <note place="margin">Ibid. 6-73</note> good way vnto it; and, for the residue of that Chapter, dooth make recitall of it. The effect whereof is (for although some there bee that allot the foure last Verses <note place="margin">Vulg. edid. Tremel Iun. Ioā. wolphius. Lyr. Con. Pellic</note> to the time of <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> that nowe wee are in: yet seeing others are of other iudgement therein, and Saint <hi>Hierom</hi> him-selfe noted to bee so too, I thought it the safest, so to leaue it; so much the rather, because our Bybles doe so like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise) that getting a Catalogue of those that with <hi>Zorobabell</hi> came from <hi>Babylon,</hi> first, he conceiued that by the helpe of it, seeing it sorted them into their seuerall Families, hee might be able to finde, who might best bee called vppon, and vrged too (if neede were) to come to <hi>Hierusalem</hi> to inhabit there. But we doe not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward find, that which was done therin, to be done by the help of that catalogue, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> nor by <hi>Nehemiah</hi> neyther, as, when we come to the place, wee are then farther to see. But now, whereas the people yet were so few in <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> yea euen when the Walles were builded, and the Gates set vp (for it was lesse maruaile, if they made no hast theither before) when as notwithstanding the Temple (and so the only place of worshipping) was there, &amp; the same (as we saw before) richly endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it plainely argueth one of these two: either, that the daies were very doubtfull
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:7530:279"/> yet, there to inhabit, notwithstanding all those grauntes they had before; or else, that the people were nothing religious, so generally planting themselues so farre from the Temple. We also may haue by our superiors, in some sort, very good countenance borne in Religion, when neuerthelesse in diuers things wee finde no security to be any thing forward therein: as also on the other side, many of vs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard but litle to be any thing forward in the sincerity of our profession, how plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly so euer we see, that we most safely do it.</p>

But it is cleere, that now the people were very religious: and that the speciall zeale where-with they were touched then, did soone after sort it selfe to speciall good effect too. That they were religiously giuen, it appeareth first in all the people generally: then in certaine of them, and the residue agayne ioyning with them therein. In all the people generally it appeared the first daie <note place="margin">Neh. 8: 1-12.</note> of the month, they all desiring <hi>Ezra</hi> to reade the Law of God vnto them, and to acquaint them with it: and, when they had heard it, beeing so effectually touched therewith as they were. For they did so weepe and sorrow, belike in respect that their Elders and they had so much offended, that whereas at that time, as their case was then, they were in duty to reioyce and giue thankes, that both <hi>Nehemiah</hi> and <hi>Ezra</hi> them-selues, and many others of the chiefe men besides, were faine to stay them, and to turne that their mourning, vnto a publike ioy and reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing: and, it seemeth, had much a-doe to obtaine it of them.

How this good zeale of theirs did soone after sort it selfe to speciall good effect too, is likewise ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry plainely declared, in that within very few dayes of that solemnity already passed, <note place="margin">Ibid. 9: 1-10: 29.</note> they in such sort praesented themselues againe, abandoning their vnlawfull marry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages (so many of them, belike, as yet remained) and confessing all their other sins generally, so diligently exercising themselues like-wise in the word of God, that thereby perceiuing, now better then before, that they had exceeding much on their part broken the Couenant, they now thought good, on their part to renue it again, in some actuall and solemne manner: which also they did, accursing al that did not; and binding themselues, both by sealing and swearing vnto it. In which it shall be good more specially to consider, first of that their excercise in the word of God: then, of the points of this their Couenant. Of that their exercise in the word of God, seeing it seemeth to bee implyed to haue beene daily for the time, whether three houres at once, or the fourth part of the day, as some doe take it, may not as well stand by the propriety of that tongue: as foure times a-day, which is for the <note place="margin">Tremel.

An opinion more odding from the iudgement of others, than standing on warrant of the Text it selfe: or can well agree with the nature of those Sacrifices that were of thankes-giuing, wherein, after the oblation, they were to dresse for themselues, and therewith to Feast before the Lord. Those points of the Coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, were, one of them more generall: the others, more speciall. That which was more generall, was, that thenceforward they would walke in the Law of God, <note place="margin">Neh. 10: 29</note> and obserue and do all such thinges as he appointed. Those that were more speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, were concerning certaine duties, whereunto, as their case then was, they need to haue some speciall regard: some of them being but concerning their owne pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate waies; others, the Publique Seruice of God. Those that concerned their own priuate waies, were one of them to praeuent that they did not degenerate into a base or mungrell people; the others, of certaine duties to them appertaining, as they stoode cleere the people of God. To praeuent that they did not degenerate, they now did couenant, that they would not thenceforward make any marriages with <note place="margin">Ibid. 30.</note> the people of the Land. Those other duties to them appertaining, as they stoode cleere the people of God, which now they make part of their couenant, were two: one concerning one speciall day; another concerning one speciall yeare. That speciall day, was the Sabboath: concerning which they now did couenant, that if <note place="margin">Ibid. 31.</note> the people of the Land should thenceforward bring any wares or victuals on the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Sabboath day (as before they were wont) they would in no wise take any of them; a very good kind of checke to such profaine Merchants, victualers and to all such as vse to sell, if, when themselues will not be ruled, the people then would take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of them, but make them carry it home againe.

But whether, eyther themselues promised, or the Law requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, vtterly or cleane to forgiue what was owing vnto them, and they could not get vp before, or but onely for that yeare to spare them: that is a point that seemeth not perfectly yet to be cleered.

Now it is plaine, that that which they promise heere is for all their debts indifferently; not excepting the rich more than the poore: and it seemeth they were in so good minde now, that indeede they yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to that which the Lawe required of them. But by all likelihoode there were many of them whose estate was not able to beare to forgiue all, both one and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="537" facs="tcp:7530:280"/> euen the great as well as the small: and so it was not their meaning, and yet that they meant so much as the Lawe required of him. In the Law also it selfe, though our translations seeme to import, that such a kind remitting is meant, as that hee to <note place="margin">Deut 15: 1-4.</note> whom it was due, might neuer so much as afterward aske it: yet the <hi>Hebrew</hi> word is noted so to bind vpon hard and streight dealing, that it seemeth there is no asking <note place="margin">Ari, Monton.</note> of it after forbidden, but such as hath hard dealing in it. So it seemeth rather to be the safer of the two, that wee go no farther heerein, than to conceiue, that the Lawe did before require, and that they now did couenant, but onely, that, as for that yeare they would not take benefite of their owne Land to their owne priuate vse, but for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare it then; so, whatsoeuer debts were owing vnto them, they would not that yeare vrge them of any: but then, on the other side againe, that as the Lawe did not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid them, afterward to take vse of their Land as before, neyther did they meane to abandon their right to the vse thereof farther than so; so neyther did they take it, that the Law did require, neyther did themselues meane, but afterward in good manner to looke for such debts as were due vnto them, where they might conueniently and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> orderly haue them. And this so much the rather, for that there is another Law for releeuing of those that were decaied or in neede among them. Out of which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding it may bee obiected, that the respect of the seauenth yeare is so menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned there, as if it might seeme that it should bee the losse of it cleane. It is so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede: but yet may it aswell signifie no more, but onely the drift of time, that so hee should be put of a yeare longer, before hee should see his owne againe; which with Money-men, is it selfe a matter irksome enough. Neyther yet is it to bee denied, but that, as in the fiftieth yeares institution, God would so moderate the desires of such as would buy Land out right, or take for yeares, as that they should not extend their desires therein but onely vnto that fiftieth yeare: so, it might please God to haue it his mind for this also (as a rudiment, or point of discipline, wherein he would haue his people to exercise their obedience vnto him) that such debts as they could not well get vp before, they should then cleane remit; which if they could not wel beare, then might they accordingly moderate their lending before. But in respect of that which already is said, it is not amisse to take heede to a marginall note that wee haue in some of our <hi>English</hi> Bibles, seeming to import, that of the richer sort euen in the <note place="margin">1594. in Deut 15<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

So likewise, that it is conceiued, that such debts should be to the poorer sort cleane remitted, to prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue <note place="margin">Lyr. in Deut. 15.</note> them from Idolatry, for that poore men being hardly vrged, might easily take occasion thereby to flee the Land, and to seate themselues among Idolatrous peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and so become Idolatrous themselues: first there is no such thing set down in the Text; then also that consideration dooth not infer, that men may not looke for their owne, but that they may not, to get it againe, deale hardly with any. Of those that concerned the Publique Seruice of God, there be two sorts: the former of them for <note place="margin">neh. 10: 32-34 Ibid. 33-39</note> the performance of the Seruice it selfe; the latter, for the maintainance of those that should do it. These matters are plaine enough in the Text, and leaue two good lessons vnto vs. One, that we do not truely repent, or turne vnto God, but so farre as we haue care that his worship bee well performed among vs: the other, that wee haue no sufficient regard of it neyther, but so farre as we restore to the Ministery the maintainance that is due vnto them.</p>
            <p n="18">18 Those that were ciuill, were chiefly two: one the peopling of <hi>Ierusalem;</hi> the other, about the dedication of the Walles lately builded. Vnto the peopling of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
               <hi>Ierusalem</hi> wee haue some other thinges annexed, by occasion thereof, as it seemeth: so that first we are to consider of that matter it selfe; then, of those others, that by oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion heere of seeme to be thereunto annexed. As touching that matter it selfe, as it did of old appertaine to the Tribes of <hi>Iudah</hi> and <hi>Beniamin,</hi> the Citty it selfe stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding part of it in the one Tribe, and part in the other: so it was for them to haue a speciall regard vnto the inhabiting of it, as their owne proper possession. The Priests
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:7530:281"/> also and the <hi>Leuites</hi> were to haue the like regard thereunto, because the Temple was <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> by Gods appointment erected there, and because the seruice therein to be done, did by the same appointment of God belong vnto them. So, what by naturall inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to our ancient right, that commonly raigneth in vs: and by the duty that in such case, men of any reckoning doe acknowldge they ow vnto God, it is very strange, that <hi>Ierusalem</hi> the head Citty of all the Land, and so specially graced by the Temple there, should neuerthelesse haue speciall care imployed about it, to get so many peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple there to inhabit, as might bee conuenient to furnish the Citty. But such is the rage of enemies oft-times against the people of God, and so dogged displeasures they euer cast to doe vnto them so oft as they may, that many good men are thereby driuen, both to abandon their owne right, and that which otherwise they could most comfortably of all other things enioy: and withall to withdraw themselues from such duties in Gods holy Temple among vs erected, as otherwise neyther in conscience they could, nor, if with any quietnes they might be so imploied, willingly would. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthelesse diuers there were, both of the chiefe and principall Fathers of all sorts of <note place="margin">Neh. 11: 1, 2</note> them, and of the people that of their owne accord willingly yeelded there to inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit: but yet was it a thing, though otherwise needfull, so full of danger and trouble, that all the rest thanked them much, and counted themselues beholding vnto them therein. But because these were nothing neere enow, they were faine to take some farther order: and because to do it by lots, culling out the tenth of them all, was most indifferent, they so resolued, and did accordingly.

But if as the words seeme to import, he was for the King in all af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires toward the people, then is it somewhat hard, that there should be any other in the times of <hi>Ezra</hi> and <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> in so great authority there: vnlesse it should be vnderstood of some time that toucheth not their aforesaid gouernment; or els be restrained as afore, which for this cause also it may seeme so much the rather to be.</p>
            <p n="19">19 That which is of those that were of the Priest-hood is, as it seemeth, but <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> onely certaine seuerall notes of them, in this place recorded, that so the memory of them might the rather continue, &amp; the same to very good purpose, as the case may diuers times be: some conceiuing, that therfore they are recited here, for that the dedication of the wals which next after followeth, was to be performed especially <note place="margin">Lyr. Conr, Pel. Ioan. wolph. Tremel. Iun.</note> by them, and that therefore they were to be recited first; others, and the more like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the two, as I doe take it, that it was by occasion of reciting those others be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that inhabited <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and of those also that dwell in the Countrey. But it is the manner of the Scripture very often, while it is in other matter of Story, to <note place="margin">Gen. 5, 10, 22: 20-24. 25: 12-18. 36: 9-30</note> breake off for the time, and then to take in matter of Genealogy: and so lesse mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell, if we haue it heere, or any where else, not on praesent occasion offered there, but to serue the purpose some where else. But whereas here we haue so speciall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citall of the Priest-hood, thus much may we bee bold together, that for that time, (&amp; so likewise so oft as we haue the like testimony for any time els) it pleased God to be gracious vnto them in that he had his Ministery among them, and a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all succession of it. As we also may in like sort reckon of the fauour or displeasure of God, as it pleaseth him to vouchsafe vs that externall meane of our good estate in him. For the order of these notes here, we may note thus much, that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as those that appertained to the Priest-hood, were either Priests or Leuites, we first haue relation of both together; then of certaine of them a-part by themselues: &amp; that this order is obserued twice. In the former of these our first note is, both of <note place="margin">Neh. 12: 1-7.</note> Priests and Leuites, such as first came with <hi>Zorobabel</hi> out of their Captiuity from <hi>Babylon:</hi> first shewing what the Priests were who then returned; then comming to the Leuites also. Those others of whom we haue note heere apart by themselues, <note place="margin">Ibid. 8, 9.</note> are onely Priests: and first of the High-Priests onely; then of others, such as were of special reckoning too. The note that is of the High-priests, is of so many of them <note place="margin">Ibid. 10, 11. <hi>Ioseph. Antiq. lib.</hi> 11. <hi>cap.</hi> 7, 8</note> as successiuely did reach the whole time frō their return out of Captiuity to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the time that yet wee are in, euen to the time of <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, a fewe yeares after the Story of <hi>Nehemiah:</hi> who in all that time were sixe, one after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by lineall descent. The note that we haue of other Priestes besides, who also were of good reckoning among them, is not of any such large compasse of time, <note place="margin">Ibid. 12-21.</note>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> but of such as liued, in a manner, all together: and were in place, in the time of <hi>Ioakim,</hi> the second of those sixe High-Priestes that we spake of, the Sonne of <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shua,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ezra. 2: 2.</note> who was the High-Priest when they returned; that time beeing noted to be twenty and eyght yeares, <hi>Ioakim</hi> himselfe beeing High-Priest so long after the <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Fanct. Chronol. in an.</hi> 3492.</note> death of his Father, in whose absence hee had occupyed the place before. But in it wee may note two thinges: one, as touching the estate or degree that they were of; the other, of the number of them. For the estate or degree that they were of, they are plainely saide to be chiefe Fathers: and yet were all these vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der others, and such as were no High-Priestes neyther. There are if we mark, in the note of those that returned with <hi>Ieshuah</hi> (as wee sawe in the first note heere placed) two and twenty seuerall persons that were all Priestes: and all sayde to bee chiefe Priestes or principall men in that function, and yet not the High-Priestes <note place="margin">Ibid. 7.</note> neyther, as there also is noted. And these others that now wee speake of were all vnder them; euery of them vnder one of those others: and all them in the selfe-same order, but for some varryance in some fewe of theyr Names;
<pb n="540" facs="tcp:7530:282"/> and in one of them it faileth clean. The names do varry most, in the fift, seauenth, eight, and ninth of the first note: and a little in two or three afterward following. That, wherein it faileth cleane, is in the sixt of the first note also: all the others be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Which variety of their names, in two places so neere together, and wherein the latter hath so speciall relation vnto the former, may well bee thought to giue great probabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, both that these are seuerall notes, and that they were not put together by one and the selfe same person; yet both of GOD, sometime vsing one instrument in such seruice of his, and sometimes another: the variety of many of the Hebrewe <note place="margin">

In that one wherein that course faileth cleane, that otherwise is obserued in them both throughout, is that note of the number of them: and it is no more but this. That whereas <hi>Dauid</hi> ordeined foure and twenty courses for the better seruice of GOD, and that so it might bee lesse <note place="margin">1. Chro. 24: 1-31, 25: 1-31</note> troublesome to the parties themselues, in the former of these two notes that nowe I speake of, there bee but two and twenty; and but twenty and one in the latter: the sixt in the former, hauing none vnder him in the latter, as all the residue of his fellowes haue. Whereby it may seeme, that some of their courses were yet wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, till they were supplyed or renewed againe: and a faire blessing of GOD it was, that in so troublesome and corrupt times as they were in, there was no grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter decay than so. Yet on the other side, seeing they had one fewer in the dayes of <hi>Ioakim</hi> the Sonne, than they had in the dayes of <hi>Ieshua</hi> his Father, and euen then, when that Father of his came first from <hi>Babylon,</hi> when as notwithstanding himselfe was afterward High-Priest (as it is noted) thirty and sixe yeares by himselfe, and <note place="margin">

But it may seeme rather to be, that Religion and the worshippe of God was by those Princes so little aduanced, when as it was so long before the Temple might bee builded: rather than by any slacke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes in them; but that already they were enough and enough to that purpose there, yea and twenty times mo than were needfull yet for any such businesse as was there to bee done. As with vs also, if learning bee not so followed as it should, where most it ought, so to supply the roomes that want, the fault is not there where it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to lye, but in those that giue the occasion of it, discouraging much good pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding in learning, by keeping away so much of the reward thereunto appertay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and impayring the rest so fast as they doe. A matrer so much the rather to bee marked of those, that seeke to the Authour aforesaide that found no difficultie herein (and sure an Authour right worthy to be sought vnto, both for learning and godly wisedome, both in this Booke and diuers others: but <hi>Homer</hi> himselfe slum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> sometimes) for that in the same place also hee professeth, hee sawe nothing woorthy the marking for our instruction. In the latter of those, our first note is <note place="margin">Neh. 12: 22.</note> both of Priestes and Leuites together, as before; but nowe wee haue no recitall of them here, as in the others, but onely a remembraunce that such a note there was taken of them; and therein the Leuites (who were the inferiours, if they were no more than Leuites; but many of them were) first named, before the Priestes that
<pb n="541" facs="tcp:7530:282"/> were the superiours. In this note wee may marke, first that whereas already wee haue note of such as were in the dayes of <hi>Ieshua</hi> and <hi>Ioakim</hi> two of the first of those sixe High-Priests whose Genealogy or lineall descent we had before, now is this of all such as followed after in the daies of the last foure of them, <hi>Eliasib, Ioiada, Ioha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nan,</hi> and <hi>Iaddua:</hi> and that, seeing this note was taken in the raigne of <hi>Darius</hi> King of <hi>Persia,</hi> it referreth vs to the last of that name whom <hi>Alexander</hi> ouerthrew, none <note place="margin">Tremel. Iun.</note> other of that name reaching vnto the time of <hi>Iaddua,</hi> one of those that here is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. Then that seeing it did not please God here to recite them; nor to reserue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs that note where they were entered into record, it is not absolutely needefull for the Church of God to haue the Story of succession, in particularities to bee still continued. Hauing promised that he will be with his euen to the end, so we make vndonbted assurance of it, the matter is lesse if we doe not euer distinctly know by whom he hath done it, or from time to time doth it yet. Of the Leuites, a-part by themselues, we haue two notes moe: one, much like to this other of the Leuites &amp; Priests together; the other, therein varrying from them. For the former of them <note place="margin">Neh. 12: 23.</note> is no more but only a remembrance here, that such a note is else-where taken; and that, of the chiefe and principall Fathers of the <hi>Leuites:</hi> but this note heere, both referreth vs to the Booke of the Chronicles; and telleth vs, that there we haue all, euen to the time of the last but one, of those sixe High-Priests afore-said. What Booke of Chronicles is it that here he meaneth, himselfe dooth not shew. But true it is, that in the Book of Chronicles which we haue extant, there haue we the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall Fathers of the Leuites expressed, and their courses withall; by the rule and patterne where of such as followed were euer to repaire their courses decaied: and so is it by diuers taken, that that is the meaning of the Text heere. But seeing hee doth so praecisely note by the person, a man well knowne, how farre that Register <note place="margin">Lyr. Trem. Iun.</note> should extend; and seeing those other notes are of the chiefe Fathers in particular: it seemeth rather, that he pointeth to some such Booke of Chronicles as now wee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> haue not; and that God hath not thought good to reserue it vnto vs, as wee know it hath pleased him to deale with many other Monuments besides. Another Testy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, that particular succession neede not to be so knowne vnto vs. That which herein varryeth from both those last before, is the same that followeth next, and is the last of them all: it both noting the persons themselues, and their seuerall func<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions <note place="margin">Ne. 12: 24-26</note> (one sort of them to be imployed in giuing of thankes and such like, and the others to keep the gates;) and shewing besides, in whose daies they serued, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in the daies of <hi>Ioiakim</hi> the second of those High-Priestes afore-said, and in the daies of <hi>Nehemiah</hi> and <hi>Ezra</hi> that now we speake of.</p>
            <p n="20">20 About the dedication of the walles we haue some-thing noted vnto vs (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <note place="margin">Neh. 12: 27-30</note>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> the Story dooth yet returne vnto his wonted course again) concerning diuers of those that should be speciall Agents therein: &amp; first what was done, as touching them; then, what certaine of them did. Those that should be speciall Agents in this businesse, were the Priestes and Leuites; and that which was done concerning them, rested in two principall points: one, that against this time, and against this businesse, they were from all places diligently gathered together vnto <hi>Hierusalem;</hi> the other, that they were purified also. That they were so diligently gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it seemeth to arise, not onely of those that so did call them together: but also, of themselues that so readily came in thereupon. Those that called them together, seeme to bee all the Princes, Fathers, or Leaders of the people generally, or the whole Congregation of them: as yet hauing no mention (as soone after we haue) of <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> as any doer in this matter.

<pb n="542" facs="tcp:7530:283"/> like businesse in hand now, doo take a better order therein: euen seeking out the Priests and Leuites, wheresoeuer they dwelt in the Countrey about them. There were many at <hi>Ierusalem</hi> already, as we heard before: but those will not serue (such <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> is their zeale now;) they will haue all. Yet was it but Thankes-giuing and Prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, that was the substance of this businesse: a matter that many thinke they can suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently performe, euen by themselues; some conceyuing farther, that those serui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are of the kind, that they neede not be so careful to performe them in best man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, God himselfe being euer readye, by the very Nature of them to take them, though our selues bee not so carefull to praesent the same vnto him so well as wee might. It may be likewise, that euen <hi>Dauids</hi> company, at least many of them, made no great reckoning to haue the Priests and Leuites with them, in that first at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of <hi>Dauid.</hi> For the Text it selfe doth witnesse, that <hi>Dauid</hi> at the first so or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered <note place="margin">1. Chr. 13: 1, 2</note> his speech to his Nobles and Captaines about that matter, that it seemeth his plaine meaning was (it seemeth I meane, by the Originall, <hi>Ʋatablus,</hi> and our Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Translation; and is plaine by others) to haue the Priests and Leuites wyth the rest to haue beene assembled vnto it: and yet in another place notwithstanding, that <hi>Dauid</hi> chargeth the chiefe of the Priests and of the Leuites, that they were not <note place="margin">1595. <hi>Vulg. edit. Lyr. Con. Pellic Tremel Iun.</hi> 1. Chron. 15: 11-13.</note> at that time with them. Being then so, that <hi>Dauid</hi> would haue had them, &amp; yet that they were not there (and both these by very good warrant) that they were not there, it seemeth to lye betwixt the Priests and Leuites themselues on the one side: and those Nobles and Captaines of Dauid, on the other. First for the Priests and Leuites, it is not likely that the fault was in them: first because the honor &amp; nature of the action and all probability besides, leadeth vs to thinke, that if they had bin sent for or called to that solemnity, they would not haue fayled but to haue come; then also because <hi>Dauid</hi> was no more offended with them, which by all likelyhood he would haue beene, if they had so farre disobeyed, especially the case falling out as it did, that by their absence the good action it selfe was defeated, and all that whole solemnity pittifully disgraced besides. But then as touching the Nobles and Captaines, albeit we may well hope, that many of them also were verie honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably minded heerein: yet may it well like-wise bee doubted, that many of them were yet irreligious; and such not vnlikely some way or other to disapoynt the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of the Priests and Leuites with them in that peece of businesse. That many of them were yet irreligious was likely enough to bee, for that <hi>Dauid</hi> was but newe come to his kingdome: and that in the dayes of <hi>Saule</hi> few or none sought after the Lord. If many of them were irreligious, it may be, that some of them were other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise <note place="margin">1. Chr. 13: 3.</note> notwithstanding in such fauour with <hi>Dauid,</hi> hauing so lately yeelded their al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance vnto him, or for some other good parts in them, that they might ouertreat <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Dauid therein, by arguments of the needlesnesse of their company, or some such like: or else so frame the Letters were sent, or so deale with the Messengers that went, that the Priests and Leuites should bee sure to haue no warning. For such is the generall corruption of vs all, that wee haue a naturall dislike of those that are on the behalfe of God towards vs; euen as people that are vnder obedience to a forraign Prince against their wils, do hardly brook his Officers also: and when any earthly praeheminence, cōmeth in withal, as of blood, possessions, fauour &amp; such like, then do such things stir vp that natural dislike that is in vs to be the more vehement, &amp; when occasion is offred, or we haue fit matter, to work accordingly. If any of thē so defeated the Priests &amp; Leuites at that present to be partakers of that solemnitie, both <hi>Dauid</hi> himselfe and all the company were little beholding vnto them for it, as the matter fell out in the end: and yet fell it out none otherwise, than such dealing had iustly deserued. God indeede had made speciall choise of these to such pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses; and <hi>Dauid</hi> had distributed them into certaine courses, and assigned to eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one wherein more specially to employ them-selues: but yet all this to the vse of Diuine Seruice, publickely to bee perfourmed, first in the Tabernacle, then in the Temple after. This should be publicke too; yet but voluntary, and in nature in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour some-what vnto the other, and so more freely left to the liberty of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues: yet such as were appointed for the other, those thought they (and so let vs
<pb n="543" facs="tcp:7530:283"/> conceaue too) would be meetest for this also; and those would they haue, euen in the best plenty they could, to be their chiefe Leaders and dealers herein. As this ready assembling of them together, came of the Priests and Leuites themselues (as we may probably thinke, because it was their owne cause also, that partly it did) therein haue they giuen all of that sort a good example in all such cases to be ready to put too their hand to al good actions (though none of those whereto they were chiefly ordained) and to help forward the same the best that they can: and that so much the rather, for that the good and orderly performing of such actions cannot be intended to proceede from any, more than from them. In that it is noted they were purified also, though the action or doing of it lay altogether on themselues: yet the manner of speech seemeth to import, that it was the desire and motion of others also. As also it doth very naturally arise, that when people are bent to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny good action, and would haue it performed so well as might be, then to call vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on such as are to bee the speciall actors, to addresse themselues vnto it in the best <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> maner that they are able, and to be earnest with them therein: and that the others being so stirred vp by the whole company, as accounting themselues to be interes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in it, and then considering their owne duty strongly to vrge it vnto them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, doe thereupon more earnestly stir vp themselues to set in hand with their bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse in the best manner they are able. A very good example to vs, both for the whole company, and for all our principall agents, in all our actions, that are of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to bee carefull to performe them in the best manner wee may, and each sort therein to put to our hands the best that we can. That which these did, when thus they were gathered together, and when thus they had purified or praepared them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, was, that they did the same to certaine others also, to whom in that case it appertained: praeparing them first, or making them ready vnto the businesse they hadde in hand. Concerning which, the truth is, that by the Lawe of God both men themselues, besides the vncleannesse they got by sin, might other-wise also be Legaly vncleane before God: &amp; so might other things about them besides, as their houses, garments, and vessels; as we do more fully shew when we haue those laws in hand. True it is also, that by such ceremonial or legall vncleanes, either in people themselues, or in thinges to them appertaining, if any such should be by their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault, men might very grieuously offend God, and pluck down on themselues some heauy iudgement: not because such things (for many of them) were otherwise ill of themselues; but onely that God had set that burne vpon them &amp; thereby would teach them, in all things to depend on his will and pleasure to them deliuered, and euer to take notice of their vncleannesse. Now therefore was it the part of these Priests and Leuites, thus gathered together to this solemnity, so soone as first they had clensed themselues, then to aduise themselues of others also: and then, seeing the people especially, then also euen the wals &amp; the gates, might some way or other be in some pollution, they were likewise to haue an eye vnto them, and to see them all praepared in the best manner they could; least that otherwise, by the slip of some one, it might so fall out, that God might be offended with all. So first, beginning with the people, they were to put them in mind of all such things as might in such case defile them, and earnestly to labour them to put away all such things whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer: and then were they themselues also to clense them as was appointed. Then comming to the wals and gates, there were they to see, there were nothing that by Law might make them vncleane, nor those that should bee imploied about them: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> then to clense them also Legally, as they did the people before. All which it is here said that they did.

            <p n="21">21 The Story nowe returning to his former course, bringing in <hi>Nehemiah,</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> speaking vnto vs again in his owne person, hauing a while vsed that course, it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth soone to turne from it againe. So are we againe to consider, what it is that in the person of <hi>Nehemiah</hi> it deliuereth vnto vs: and what it giueth vnto vs besides, as in the person of some other. In the person of <hi>Nehemiah</hi> it deliuereth vnto vs, how,
<pb n="544" facs="tcp:7530:284"/> when the praeparation was in such sort made as we heard before, then he dedicated <note place="margin">Ne. 13: 31-43</note> the wals, and with them, not onely the Gates, but euen the whole Citty also vnto the Lord, as committing the same to his protection, and desiring him to extend his fauor towards it. But as touching the maner of doing it, though some things there be plaine enough; yet others there are somwhat hard to be conceiued: and in this case, as I do take it, it shall be good more specially to consider of both. First, as touching that which is plaine, their purpose was, in some set and solemne manner to giue thanks and praise vnto God, for that which he had done for them already; and to solace themselues therein, euen in the face of all their enemies round about them: and to make praier withall, for the continuance of that his fauour towards them and that Citty, and euen to the Wals and Gates thereof which now in some sort they had repaired. This did <hi>Nehemiah</hi> conceiue might best be done, for some part of it, by deuiding themselues into seueral companies: and other some part, by vniting them together againe. Seeing some part of it may best be done by diuiding themselues into seuerall companies, and <hi>Nehemiah</hi> did so accordingly, we are first to consider what he to that end did: then, what was done therein by them. Hee first diuided them into such companies; and then sent them forward about theyr businesse, appointing to each of them the way they should take. The companyes were, first of the Priests and Leuites: then of the residue of the people. The Priests and Leuites he diuided into two companies: the residue of the people likewise, at least the chiefe and principall of them to other two. Those two companies of the Priests and Leuites were to go before, and in the name of all the companie to giue thanks and praise vnto God, both with their voyces &amp; Instruments too: and those other two compaaies of the people were to follow after; one part of them follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> the former, <hi>Nehemiah</hi> himselfe and the residue following the latter. That which was done by these companies therein, is no more, but that they did as was appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. That which was to bee done, by vniting them together againe, was, that both companies both of the Priests and Leuites, and of the rest of the people, comming all to the Temple, there they worshipped in very good manner, and to the speciall reioycing of all. These things are plain enough vnto al: and these are the substance of all their doings. But now whereas the Text doth farther tell vs, which were the waies that each of these companies tooke, and we haue certaine reports &amp; descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the forme and manner of that Citty, some of them of more auncient time, others more late; whereas also diuers of the learned haue commented or written hereon, both in former ages, &amp; in these our daies also: yet the way that these com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies kept, is not onely, not as yet described by any of them (that yet I haue seen) but not so much as medled withall neither, but slipped of all, as past their reach, and yet not so acknowledged neither. And there is no quaestion of this, but that time is euer wont to make such alteration of Cities, either to the better, or to the worse, or some way or other transposing the particular estate of most part of them: as that it may well be, that this report that heere wee haue of certaine particular places of that Citty then, can in no wise agree to such descriptions thereof as haue reached to vs, for that when those descriptions were taken, it was not in those particulars such then, as it was at the time that now we speak of. It may be also conceiued, that it is not materiall or needfull, to haue this direction that we haue here, to be answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by such descriptions as we haue of that City since: as indeed it is not, absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. But seeing it hath pleased God, that wee should haue these particular places so specially noted vnto vs, it is not vnlikely, but that hee would haue vs make vse of them also: and, it may be, that as it was a figure of a better Citty aboue, ordayned for vs in Iesus Christ, so would I haue the forme thereof, so much the more careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to that end praeserued, albeit, that now we otherwise haue little vse of it. And see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there be diuers of the learned that haue trauailed to describe the same vnto vs, and it may be, that yet there are others that will bestow some labour therein: it is not amisse, in that respect also, out of this to note, what defects may bee already in those that we haue, and how some others might be therein amended. Of those de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptions that we haue, although there be diuers commended vnto vs: yet is it not

Where they did set forth or began to enter into that solemnity, we haue not by name or particularlie set down vnto vs: but yet it seemeth, it may well be gathered. For <hi>Nehemiah</hi> plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> telleth vs, that he brought the Princes of <hi>Iudah</hi> (&amp; the rest withall, as that which <note place="margin">Neh. 12: 31</note> followeth of appointing his two companies there, doth imply) vp, vnto some part of the wal which stood high: and from whence, that one of the companies that he appointed to go towards the Dung-gate, should go on the right hand of the wall, as they held their way thither. To find out likewise what Coast should lye to their right hand, we must conceiue how then they stood, which by all likely-hood was, their faces bent towards the Temple, whither now they were to take their way. So falleth it out, that now they were come together to the North end of the citty, neer to the wal there, thence to set forth in that their intended solemnity vnto the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. But whereas the most of our translations, and the very originall it selfe, doe so speake of the wall heere, as if this company stood, and thence went forward, on the Wall it selfe: it is more significantly set downe by others, that they were but <note place="margin">Tremel Iun.</note> brought vppe vnto it, and not vppon it. For neyther could any such part of quantitie of the Wall contayne such a multitude of people, all to stand at once

By which also we may see, that it was not the out-side of the wall by which they went, because so the first company should haue gon on the left hand of it: and the ditches being so broad as they were, would haue kept them a good way from the wal, and haue giuen oportunity to the enemy, both against themselues and their Citty. So are they yet at the North-end of the Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, neare to the wals, but yet within them. Againe, seeing the former of these two companies must make their way by the Dung-gate, and the latter of them was to goe by the Tower of the Furnaces, thereby are we led to conceaue, that nowe they <note place="margin">Tremel.

The first place that we haue named to the former of them is that Dung-gate before mentioned, being in their way towards the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, euer keeping on the right hand of the wall by which they went; and the gate of the Fountaine and the Water-gate, are the next: both which <hi>Adrichomius</hi> doth <note place="margin">Neh. 12: 37</note> make but one, and placeth it on the East-side of the Citty; but, from whence they set foorth, about halfe so farre beyond the Temple, as they wanted of it when they <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pag</hi> 167 <hi>num.</hi> 158.</note> were at the Dung-gate aforesaide.

But true it is, that if from the gate of the Fountain or waters, they twined then into the Citty and left the wals, then had they staires iust before them in two seuerall places going vp South-ward to the city of <hi>Dauid.</hi> But that seemeth not to haue beene their course, for that so they should haue left the wals, when they had gon but the quantity of one side onely, and shold leaue all the rest vnto the others.

That which is of the people, is, that then they took order for the gathering in of all such maintenance as was due to the Priests and Leuites: and <note place="margin">Neh. 12: 44.</note> the reason added withall, is, for that then the people reioyced that the Priestes and Leuites were now occupied in their ministration. A good cause for much people of Christendome to reioyce likewise, that now the Ministery, in these daies of the Gospel, we are also imploied in the ministration to them appertaining: but wheras the <hi>Iewes</hi> were carefull thereupon to get in that which was due vnto thē, so do not many of ours; yet many of them professors too, but still hold that which they haue, and scamble for more; than the which they need no better proofe, that as yet they truely ioy not in their ministration. Those of the Ministery, of whom we haue some <note place="margin">Ibid. 45. 46</note> Story too, are certaine of the <hi>Leuites</hi> such as were to attend about the Temple, and eyther to sound foorth the praises of God with voyce and Instrument; or as Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to attend the doores, and to keepe out all vncleane whatsoeuer: as touching whom, both it is noted that they did well performe theyr duty; and that the vse of Musicke in such case did stand, by the example of godly ancients before. Those other times besides, whereunto wee haue some part of this appertaining, are, first a time that was before when <hi>Zorobabell</hi> gouerned: then the residue of the time of <hi>Nehemiahs</hi> gouernment among them. As touching both which it is recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that during their time, there was that regard to the worship of God, that euen those Singers also were maintained: and that the <hi>Leuites</hi> had their due so truely paid, that they also were able to giue their due to the Sons of <hi>Aaron;</hi> and that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly so they did. A report, as it may seeme, importing, that so oft as there bee good Gouernours, the cause of Religion is so truely regarded, that euen the matters of lesse importance, are not for sparing with-held from it; and that such as are of greater moment, are to the full, yeelded vnto it: and that they are neuer good Gouernours indeede, where that course is not obserued. That wherein <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemiah</hi> in nothing at all remembred, is, that the people (about that time) hearing
<pb n="548" facs="tcp:7530:286"/> (out of the Law of God read vnto them) how far they were to estrange themselues from the <hi>Ammonites</hi> and <hi>Moabites,</hi> or to stand of from them, did thereupon make <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> a seperation from diuers that were mingled among them. In which it shall bee good to consider, first of that point of the Lawe of God: then of that pliablenesse in the people. In that point of the Lawe of God we haue noted vnto vs, how far God doth exclude them from his people: and what was the cause why so hee did. He exculded them so farre from his people, as that neyther should they euer haue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <note place="margin">Neh. 13: 1-3 Deut. 23: 3-<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </note> speciall place among them, not so much as to bee any member of their society or body politically: and that the people of <hi>Israell</hi> were discharged, if neuer they did specially seeke the good or welfare of any of them. Truely a strange and heauy iudgement, that the people of God themselues, who are euer generally taught to be good vnto all (and are not allowed to do those any hurt neyther, nor to nourish in their hearts any malice against them) neuerthelesse are allowed to be so inexora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to these, that they neuer suffer them to get vp among them, nor any way imploy themselues, in any speciall maner, about the good of their earthly estate heere: but that they bestow that care on others, to whom they are allowed to doe it. The reasons are two: one, because they did not vse them kindly as they passed by them when they came out of <hi>Egypt;</hi> the other, because they would haue done them hurt by <hi>Balaam</hi> but that they were not able to doe it. Many of vs vse little kindnesse to such of our bretheren; and some of vs would by the <hi>Romish Balaams</hi> of our time, haue done them hurt too, though one way or other we were not able: and then, so <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Wee also are many times called vpon in matters that concerne vs as much as this, and oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times too, euen for hauing ouer great society with such among vs, or for being too inward with them: but seldome wee doe so readily amend as these did heere. In which pliablenesse of these, likewise wee haue a good experiment, how forcible <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> euen the Reading onely of the word of God is to so many as duly regard it: a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that of late was much called in quaestion among vs; and, that is more strange, euen by some of those that professed the Gospell themselues; sauing that them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues do sufficiently by their waies declare, that so far as they mislike such Readers, euen themselues so far are no followers.</p>

               </gap>tly as we should, it derogateth nothing from the Storie it selfe; and yet are wee farther behoulding to God, when hee sheweth vs, to what time we may much better referre it. Those that are plainely inough declared, are of certaine disorders that in his absence were crept in among them, and how he at his returne did reforme them againe. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, if we marke, wee may distinctly note, that first he dealt with one that concerned but some fewe seuerall persons; but then soone after, that hee dealt with another that concerned many, if not the whole people generally. Those few seuerall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons whome that disorder most concerned, were <hi>Eliashib</hi> the High-Priest, and <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biah</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
               <note place="margin">Nehe. 13. 4-6.</note> an Ammonite, and, as it seemeth, at that time also the Gouernor ouer them vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the King: and the disorder was, that part of those roomes that belonged to the Temple for holy vses, were by the High-Priest himselfe imparted to the said <hi>Tobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah</hi> vpon some alliance that was betwixt them. Not much vnlike to that which in many parts of Christendome, euen in these dayes of the Gospell we haue among vs (but in much greater measure) that so many of our Church-liuings, both the houses themselues, and the maintenance thereunto appertaining (whereas <hi>Tobiah,</hi> that we read of, had no more but house-roome onely) are so inuested as they are to profane and Lay-vses, and still so strongly with-held thereunto: &amp; that many of the chiefe Fathers of the Clergy, haue had their handes deeply enough in that matter. But when <hi>Nehemiah</hi> returned, hee was so grieued at it, that hee could in no wise abide <note place="margin">Ibid. 7-9.</note> it: and so dispossessed that vnnaturall and vnlawfull occupier, and restored those roomes to their former vse againe. Such <hi>Nehemiahs</hi> are dainty Gouernours on earth among is. <hi>Tobiah</hi> indeed was an Heathen man, at least not knowne to bee a conuert to sound Religion: ours, by generall profession are; but otherwise many of them either knowne to bee corrupt therein, or at least not vndoubtedly knowne to beare any friendly hearts vnto it. Howbeit, that, wee may see was not the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: for that when hee tooke it from him, hee did not then place some of their No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles or Gentle-men in it; but onely restored it to the former vse againe. <hi>Tobiah</hi> likewise was a man of speciall reckoning: and hee had, that which hee had, by the authority of the High-Priest himselfe. Being a man of such reckoning, and yet ioyning affinity with one of them, it might argue some good-will in him towardes them: and so giue them better hope, of the more quietnesse, the better they helde friendship with him; and reasonable plaine notice withall, that if they did not, they should breed themselues more trouble by it. In that he had it by the authoritie of the High-Priest, it might seeme to make a sufficient right; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t least to let that passe for this once, and to take better heede to others: especially, seeing he had but only the roome; and most likely that they at this time had more, than yet they could oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupy. But these things doe nothing moue him; he onely considered, what aequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and duty in that case required; that onely should be the course he would hould. Those many were the whole people to speake of, who now in the absence of <hi>Nehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah</hi> were so slacke in bringing in their tithes and other duties, that such as were to serue in the Temple were faine to leaue their duty there, and to take to some other <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> labour whereby they might be able to liue. This when he went about to reform, of that which he did therin, he did but some part at this present: then more a while after. He did but part at this present, belike because hee espied other matters also that might not be slipped: and so, as it were, stepped aside to them also. In that which at this time he did, wee finde that hee ioyned prayer thereto in the end. So first of that which he did; then, of his prayer also. That which he did, was of such force, that it wrought much with others; and so occasioned him thereupon to goe
<pb n="550" facs="tcp:7530:287"/> somewhat f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ther. That which first he did of himselfe, was, that hee reproued the <note place="margin">Ibid. 10, 11.</note> Rulers, who had suffered the House of God to bee so forsaken: and gathered in the Priestes and <hi>Leuites</hi> againe to their wonted businesse. In that which farther hee did on occasion, first the occasion was, that the people then did well bring in their Tithes: <note place="margin">Ibid. 12. Ibid. 13.</note> then that which hee did thereupon, was, that hee ordained such as were accounted faithfull, to be as Treasurers and Officers, to take those things into their custody, and to distribute the same to their bretheren. In his prayer, hee desireth God so to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept <note place="margin">Ibid. 14.</note> of his seruice therein, that he remember him in mercy: so declaring withall, that he had sincerely dealt in that matter, when he could so appeale to God therein. We also haue a <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> who one day wil reprooue such rulers as haue so little cared to see his holy worship maintained; and, it may be, not forget them neyther, one way or other, in the meane season: as also, though wee may haue, and haue such Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, as are doing something therein, and thinke besides, that they do well; yet can they neuer plead on sincerity, vnlesse they haue dealt according to their patterne gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen them. And while others are in effect but shadowes, those are the kindly Officers of the Kingdome of God indeede, that gather together the Priestes and <hi>Leuites</hi> vnto their places and duties: and see that they haue their due maintainance also. Those other matters whereunto as it were hee <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ppeth a-side before he deale any farther in this, are two: one, of the Sabboath; the other, of marriage. That of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boath, was, that in his absence, it grew to bee much profained among them: in which likewise, first hee sheweth vs what hee did therein; and then falleth againe to prayer. That which hee did, was first about the abolishing of that praesent profanation: then, for the praeuenting of the like afterward. For the abolishing of that profanation which already was, hee found the fault both with his owne people: and with strangers. His owne people hee roundly reproued: and yet <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> not onely for greater profanations that hee espied, euen in <hi>Ierusalem;</hi> but also <note place="margin">Ibid. 15.</note> euen for buying and selling of victuals. For that which hee found in strangers, hee first reproued but the Rulers for bearing with them therein, and caused the Gates to be shut against them: but then, when diuers of them were yet vnruly, hee threatned <note place="margin">Ibid. 16-21</note> the next time to lay hold on them; and so got them at length to giue ouer. For prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenting of the like afterward hee caused certaine of the <hi>Leuites</hi> to keepe the Gates: <note place="margin">Ibid. 22.</note> and thereto also to sanctifie themselues first, so to bee more carefull therein. His prayer now againe was, that God would remember him in this, and padon him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording <note place="margin">Ibin. 22.</note> to his great mercy. That other of marriage, was, that in his absence like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise diuers of them had taken strange wiues againe: and one man of speciall account among them. Concerning whom, first hee noteth, what his dealing was with ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them: then what was the effect of his dealing with them all. Setting in hand to shew what his dealing was with eyther of them, in those that had made this fault <note place="margin">Ibid. 23-27</note> generally, first he noteth what mungrell-children they had thereby: then also he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued and punnished certaine of them, and tooke an Oath of them, that they should no more do it. That one of speciall reckoning among them, was one of the Sons of <hi>Ioiada,</hi> the sonne of <hi>Eliashib</hi> the High-Priest; whom therefore hee chaced away <note place="margin">Ibid. 28, 29.</note> from him: and accounted that dealing, so great an indignity offered to that holy fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, that he earnestly prayeth against all those that any way defile that holy calling. The effect of his dealing with them all, was, that hee clensed them from all the stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers that were among them. In that which farther hee did about the Diuine Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice <note place="margin">Ibid. 30.</note> of God, first he sheweth what it was: and then againe falleth to prayer. That which he did, was, first he appointed the Wards or courses of the Priests and <hi>Leuites,</hi> euery one in his office (which belike was now more deliberately done, and better <note place="margin">Ibid. 30.</note> established, than hee could doe on the suddaine before: and that heerein it varied from that other:) then, that hee made prouision for them besides. Wherein, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause hee doth so specially name those two particulars that there he nameth, belike those were such thinges as came hardliest in: the Countrey it selfe hardly yeelding <note place="margin">Ibid. 31.</note> the former: and mens hearts as hardly yeelding the latter. For as touching the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, <hi>Abraham</hi> many hundred yeares before this, comming to doe sacrifice there, is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 22: 3, 6, 7</note> noted to haue taken wood from home with him (which by likelihoode he would not
<pb n="551" facs="tcp:7530:287"/> haue done, but that then also it was scant in those partes:) and we haue Story of our time, in some of those hotter Countries, of seeing Wood thirty miles, and <note place="margin">In the English Nauigations: in the storie of Tho. San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders pag. 196 Ibid. 31.</note> plucking vp Iuniper, and such like by the rootes, and laying the same on Camels backes, for the scantnesse of it. And as for the other we may easily finde our hearts so straight laced for such matters, that we may bee expositors to our selues, wherefore <hi>Nehemiah</hi> tooke so speciall order about it. His prayer now is, much like as before, that God would remember him in goodnesse. Wee also, when we haue done all that we can, and though we haue doone vnto God speciall good seruice, in comparison of thousandes of others: yet neuer doe we any thing at all, that is worth remembrance with God; or any other fauour at his handes. Inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that euen the best that is, needeth earnestly to entreat God to remember him, and those poore iobs of seruice that he hath doone him; and none otherwise to deale with him, not with the seruice that he hath doone him, but onely in the depth of his mercy: <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> a notable patterne, hauing so plainely led vs the way hereunto. For whosoeuer considereth of those seruices that this Story re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordeth of him, shall quickly finde (if his sight bee any thing good; and, in this last Chapter especially, it is by one very worthily noted) that he was a most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent <note place="margin">Ioan. wolph. in arg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="25">25 As touching those that came not downe at all, neyther yet tarryed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> there for the good of the people, but rather in some other respectes (at least, for the most part of them) wee haue, as it seemeth, two Stories of them: of one there is no quaestion at all, that I doe know of; but of the other there is. That whereof there is no quaestion at all, is that Story of the people in the dayes of <hi>Ester:</hi> a speciall good Story in it selfe; and such as giueth vs good occasion to <note place="margin">Ester.</note> consider of one other thing also. The Story it selfe is first, and for the most part, of a notable daunger that all the whole company of the people of God were in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> that tarryed behinde; and how it pleased God to deliuer them from it: but then, we haue some farther Srory of that State, though much it be not. As touching that their daunger and deliuerance out of it againe, because it pleased him to doe it by one speciall meane, that he to that purpose ordained, therefore doth the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry shewe, first, how it pleased God to prouide that meane: then, how it pleased him thereby to worke their deliuerance, when they were falne in the danger wee speake of. The meane was, that <hi>Ester</hi> being by her lynage or people, a <hi>Iew,</hi> or one of that peculiar people of God, other-wise (for any thing wee know) but a young Woman, of no speciall reckoning more than others, was neuerthelesse ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uanced to bee Queene, the King <hi>Assuerus</hi> or <hi>Ahashoerosh,</hi> called also <hi>Darius,</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king that liking of her, that he ioyned himselfe in marryage with her. Hee was marryed to another before: but as matters fell out, shee was dyuorced, and <hi>Ester</hi> taken in, in her roome. First then we are to see, how it fell out, that the other was diuorced: then, how this was taken in, in stead of that other. The other was diuorced, for that on a time shee did not obey the Kinges commaundement, which notwithstanding was not imposed on her, as she was his subiect; but only as she was his wife. For on a time being purposed to shew forth the power, and riches, <note place="margin">Ester. 1: 1-11</note> and glory of his kingdome he thought good to do the same by honorable &amp; mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent feasting of his Princes and people: and one speciall point of his glory then to be, that they then also might see the Q. in her magnificence. In all which exces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siue roialty of his (which indeed was great, as there it is to vs described) there was notwithstanding one good point of sobriety too. In that his royalty, it is good to learne to know, what is the vttermost pitch of al earthly pomp &amp; glory: and so that there is no more nor greater matter, at the hands of the world to be expected. He
<pb n="552" facs="tcp:7530:288"/> was indeede a mighty Monarch, hauing an hundred and seauen and twenty Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinces vnder him; many of those hauing beene great Kingdomes, and so after became againe, and yet could his great magnificence reach, but onely to such tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fles as those. An experiment of sufficient proofe in it selfe, that the World in that respect is like to a great glorious Merchant in shew, who is a very Banckrout and Begger indeede. But if, when that earthly Prince was disposed, to shew his magnificence, hee could so gloriously furnish his Feast, as it is noted in this that hee did; and so long continue it too: what then may wee looke for at the handes of GOD, when he shall be disposed to shew his glory, to all his Saints, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> in that most glorious Kingdome of his? That one speciall point of sobriety that was there in that excessiue feasting of his, was, that none should be compelled to drinke, but onely as themselues would: a great condemnation to many of vs, that make such wast of the good blessings of GOD: so immeasurably load the weaknesse of others; take such pleasure to see them ouer-taken there-with; and yet professe Christian sobriety too. In that his Queene must come in too, in her magnificence, to helpe to set foorth this pompe of his, wee may note ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vse of marryage, than the Children of GOD doe know, or than Christian sobriety teacheth: but yet such, as experience so bewrayeth in many of vs, that our selues might well enough see (at least the wiser sort doe) that our glory there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is no better than shame indeede; and that so much the more, as all men may see, how great good might redound to others, by the example of such modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in such as are of cheefe rekoning among vs. That the Queene refused to <note place="margin">Ibid. 21, 22.</note> come, when the King had so sent for her, is not any way, I thinke, to be excused: and yet it may seeme, that theyr sentence against her, was not altogether allowa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble neyther. Her refusing, for any thing we know, was in no wise to be excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, for that hee was not onely her Husband (which in most cases had beene suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent) but her Soueraigne (which lightly allowed no exception at all) who then sent for her: and for that he did send for her by so known men as he did; euery of them, as wee tearme it beeing a sufficient warrant him-selfe. Theyr sentence against her was, to bee diuorced from the King; and the King to take his choyce of some other to his owne best liking; and this, first because her selfe hadde so disobeyed; then, because thereby shee had giuen so daungerous an example, to all other marryed Women besides. Whereunto the King farther added, to haue it proclaimed in all his Kingdomes, that in euery mans House, the authority of commaunding there, should euer rest with the man; an order, that it is maruell if it did seeme strange vnto any, when as not onely the word of God, (wherewith it may be they were little or nothing acquainted) but euen the Law of Nature it selfe, and all ciuilitie and good order too requireth the same. Yet are there diuers maried women of so head-strong a Nature, especially if any way they excell theyr Husbands▪ as by possessions, birth, or wit, or but in theyr owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, that it is no great maruaile though this King thought good to publish such a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Law to his people. Yet in that theyr decree against <hi>Ʋashti,</hi> we do not find, that they first inquired any farther of the cause why she came not: &amp; it may wel be, that she had good cause to be loath to haue gon, if it might please the King to spare her. If first they did not make any farther inquiry what reason shee had why she came not, then marryage beeing so indissoluble a knot as it is, hardly could they excuse themselues, but that they were some-what too hasty. The cause that shee might haue, why shee might bee loath to come, if it might please the King to spare her, was in womanly modesty or shamefastnesse for her selfe; and some reasonable good regard of the other Ladies and Matrons that so should attend her. For it is noted not onely of the <hi>Babylonians</hi> before, but also of the <hi>Persians</hi> who <note place="margin">

But whether the sentence were eyther too hasty or to hard, it proceedeth against her, and so is shee thereby dyuorced, and deposed from that her dignity. Howe <hi>Ester</hi> was taken in, in her roome, is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise set downe at large: but in such sort withall, as that by the Story it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, there was there great libertie giuen to the flesh by most part of them: and some infirmitie much to be doubted in the better sort also. Great libertie was giuen to the flesh by the most part of them, and some infirmitie much to bee doubted in the better sort too, first in that they made no reckoning of getting such a number together to such a purpose: then in proceeding to take vnto them the vse of them too. Of getting such a number together, it is plaine, that the most <note place="margin">Ester. 2: 1-4</note> part made no reckoning: first, those that gaue that aduise; then the King that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked thereof, and did accordingly. The better sort that had to doe herein, were <hi>Mordecay</hi> and <hi>Ester: Mordecay</hi> an auncient man, taken to <hi>Babylon</hi> with <hi>Iaco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niah,</hi> and out-liuing all the Captiuity; and <hi>Ester</hi> his Cozin-Germane, yet at this time but a young Woman. The infirmity that may be doubted in them, was, <note place="margin">Ibid. 5-8.</note> that he, it seemeth, consented that shee might be one of that companie; and that shee agreed vnto it. For that company was such, as out of quaestion were all likely to be abused (at least till the King should light on some such, as whom hee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> could be content to marry:) but to come to the estate of marriage with him as vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine as might bee; and such as could light but on one of them neyther. In that course that was held to haue the vse of them, when so they were gotten to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, they againe gaue great liberty vnto the Flesh, both in that they tooke the vse of theyr bodies: and in that there must bee so nice and daynty praeparing of them vnto it so long before. In which also it seemeth the consent of both these was in some measure praesent too: and yet a matter, that by the Nature of it should haue beene more greeuous vnto them, than for the one so to haue beene pent vp vnto death, and euery moment to haue beene vnder the danger of it; and for the other, beeing so auncient a man as hee was, and such a Father to her (his neere Kins-Woman also, as could bee) as hee had beene, rather to haue follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed her an hundred times to her Graue, than in such case so to attend the Court as he did to vnderstand of her estate therein. But loe heere-withall, the vnsearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able depth of the inaestimable goodnesse of God. They haue thus far yeelded, and yet, no doubt, but onelie their infirmity) to foule pullution: she, that should haue kept her body, in holinesse and honor; and he, that should haue bin her Shield and Buckler, yea euen her Knight or Champion in such a quarrell, euen vnto death. And yet it pleaseth GOD, both in the meane season to giue her speciall fauour in the sight of the Eunuch that had the charge of her and the rest; and in her selfe that good moderation, that shee helde her selfe contented with that fauour and <note place="margin">Ibid. 9-20.</note> beauty that God had giuen her, and so did not seeke such other helpes as others, to commend their persons so much the better vnto the King: and in the end to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward that abuse of her body first, with Matrimony immediatly after, and that in so rich and honourable manner as then he did, and to the praeseruation of so many thousands as not long after followed thereon.</p>
            <p n="26">26 The meane beeing thus before hand prouided, the Story of their daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> and deliuerance therein, dooth follow next after: but first of one man one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; then of all the whole company of them. That one man onely that was first in daunger, was <hi>Mardochaeus</hi> or <hi>Mordecay:</hi> for whom like-wise it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed GOD first to lay a Ground-woorke of his fauour: and then thereby to set him safe when hee was in daunger. The Ground-woorke of that his fauour was, that whereas two of the Kinges Seruants thought to haue killed <note place="margin">Ibid. 3: 1-6.</note> the King, <hi>Mordecay</hi> getting vnderstanding of it, so discharged his duty there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> by the mediation of <hi>Ester,</hi> that the King was praeserued: and a note was ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into record, of <hi>Mordecaies</hi> good seruice therein. In the danger he was in, we
<pb n="554" facs="tcp:7530:289"/> first haue deliuered vnto vs the occasion of it: then, what the daunger it selfe was. The occasion of it was, that <hi>Mordecay</hi> offended <hi>Haman,</hi> a man of greatest recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <note place="margin">Ibid. 3: 1-6.</note> with the King, in that first of himselfe he did not that reuerence vnto him that others did: then much more, when he vnderstood that others did put him in minde thereof, and yet then also hee would not doe it. As touching which reuerence, if it were so excessiue, as (for <hi>Mordecaies</hi> sake, belike) it is conceiued to be (otherwise praesupposing, that <hi>Mordecay</hi> would neuer haue denied to haue done that which duty required) then is <hi>Mordecay</hi> to be therein excused: but if it were but ordinary duty, and yet <hi>Mordecay</hi> had so big an heart (for men are men, euen the best of vs al) that, because hee was of the race of the <hi>Amalakites,</hi> ancient enemies to the people of GOD, he could not finde in his heart to doe it, then by omitting that point of duty, himselfe was occasion of that his danger, though it pleased God of his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to helpe him therein. The danger that thereby he was in, was no lesse then death: and not only of himselfe, but of others withall; euen many thousands of his bretheren the people of God. But it shall be good for vs to distinguish them yet: and, for a time, but to consider of his owne perrill onely. And this his death did <hi>Haman</hi> so eagerly goe about (but as I said, of many others withall) that first he did cast for an happy day to sette in hand with his great and cruell designe: but then, <note place="margin">Ibid 3: 7.</note> when he had found out a day to his liking, yet he could not tarry so long for <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decay,</hi> but must needes bee doing with him before; and so came in a morning be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time to the Court, to beg that hee might make him away, and made no doubt but to obtaine it. The daunger that others were in with all, was, that for his sake hee would destroy all the Iewes in those parts besides: and to that end first did cast for a lucky day (as before is said) and tooke time largely vnto it; and then, hauing sped thereof, sent out Commissions into all quarters, to haue the other people in a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinesse against a day, euery where to set on the <hi>Iewes,</hi> and to make a clean riddance of them, hauing first gotten the Kings consent also vnto it. But if it were so pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely and openly done, as by the Text it may seeme it was, it is then a good pattern how God did infatuate the ring-leader in this mischieuous purpose and all his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, that they had not the wit to go no more warily about it, but accounted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues so sure of accomplishing their whole desire, that although the <hi>Iewes</hi> shoulde thereby see, many dayes before, their fearefull and vtter destruction comming vpon <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> them, yet should they no way be able to scape it. This being the danger that they were in <hi>(Mordecay</hi> more specially, and all the rest generally) nowe are wee to see how it pleased God to worke their deliuerance: and first, how he gaue them grace to seeke vnto him for it; then, how he did accordingly help them. That he gaue them grace to seeke vnto him, wee haue but onely a probability of it, if it should be strictly taken: but otherwise it is most likely that so they did, for that so they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed themselues, as can no way else so well bee taken. Yet with this diuersity notwithstanding, that in all places else that which they did was of their own accord, for any thing that we finde to the contrary; but, in <hi>Shushan</hi> the chiefe Citty, by or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der appointed. That which in all places (where the <hi>Iewes</hi> dwelt) was done of their owne accord, was, that they rent their cloathes and did put on sack-cloth and <note place="margin">Ibid. 4: 1-3.</note> ashes, sorrowed, fasted, and wept (at least many of them) as their manner in such case was, when they saw how heauy a sentence was come forth against them, and in what daunger they were thereby: and this is noted to haue beene done, both by <hi>Mordecay</hi> himselfe in <hi>Shushan;</hi> and by the rest of the <hi>Iewes</hi> any where yet remaining in those parts. In that which was done in <hi>Shushan</hi> it selfe by order appointed, wee first haue noted the occasion of it: then, the thing it selfe. The occasion of it was, that <hi>Mordecay</hi> did so shew himselfe to <hi>Ester</hi> (yet but a far of, for that in such mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <note place="margin">Ibid. 4-15.</note> sort he might not come into the Court: and then are the people of God, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing cause to mourne so oft as they haue, barred thereby of much helpe that other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise they might hope to obtaine at the hands of their Princes, if they might haue accesse vnto them) and by messengers both acquainted her with the case as it stood, and required her helpe, first but after the vsuall manner, then more roundly. The thing it selfe was, that thereupon <hi>Ester,</hi> vntertaking to assay what shee could doe, <note place="margin">Ibid. 16, 17.</note>
               <pb n="555" facs="tcp:7530:289"/> required first a publique fast of all the <hi>Iewes</hi> in that Citty for three dayes together; her selfe promising that shee and her company would ioyne with them therein, and then goe to the King about it: which fast was helde as shee required; yet, as it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, but onely such in effect, as of their owne accord many of them had done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, sauing that it may bee they did not so praecisely limit it to a speciall time. In all which wee doe not reade in playne tearmes, that they sought vnto God, or cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> on him: but it cannot bee otherwise better vnderstoode but that they did, the chiefe ende of all their sorrowing beeing to intreate his fauour and helpe. Ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doe wee finde that they acknowledged that fault of theirs, for which it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth that GOD did thus shake the rodde at them: as being so worldly or carelesse of the woorshippe of GOD, as that thereuppon they stayed in those parts and went not downe into <hi>Iury</hi> with <hi>Zorobbabell</hi> to build the Temple. And though afterward <hi>Ezra</hi> came downe with some company with him: yet considering what a fauourable Commission hee had to helpe forward their businesse, his company was but small to such a purpose, in respect of those that this story sheweth to haue beene there still; neyther doe wee finde, that those that came with him, did the rather for this ioyne themselues with him. <hi>Nehemiah</hi> likewise came into the Countrey a fewe yeares after, an Officer in Court, and in great fauour with hys Prince on behalfe of the Common-wealth or estate of the <hi>Iewes:</hi> himselfe also beeing a notable man, and very thoroughly and faythfully imploying himselfe in that peece of seruice. And yet wee reade of none, but his owne retinue that came downe with him. Certainly a rare and wonderfull thing, that when they were so roundly put in minde of that profane carelesnesse of theirs before, and so quickened vp to a better regarde now, yet dooth it woorke so little with them, and still they abide so senselesse therein. So by that which followed after it, may rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable probably bee gathered, that as wee doe not finde, for all their sorrowing, that they acknowledged their fault herein: so indeede they had no remorse there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; but rather that theyr sorrowing was, that they sawe so fearefull a iudgement comming vppon them so fast, and so strongly as it did. GOD againe, as hee is a most gracious GOD, and exceedeth therein, farre aboue that which any heart created is able to conceaue, doth not stay, or delay his help towards them, till they yeelde to humble themselues vnto him therein, for the which he layd his hand vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon them: but holdeth himselfe contented with this, that they are somewhat daunted, and that in some measure they humble themselues, when thus hee knit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the browes vnto them. Neyther doe wee nowe plainely finde, euen in these the better sort of them, that <hi>Mordecay</hi> did direct this Kins-woman of his, whome himselfe also had brought vp before, to seeke first vnto GOD, but onely would haue her helpe to the King: nor in eyther of them, that they finde any defect in themselues, that they had not beene more carefull to aduaunce the glory and woorshippe of OOD at home in their owne Countrey, and to the farther com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> of that his peculiar people; and themselues to woorshippe there with them. So that on all handes that matter may seeme to bee farre from them: and that if GOD will shewe them any fauour, it must bee of his owne goodnesse onely, neyther the whole people generally, nor any of the better sort of them that wee doe reade of, acknowledging to haue offended therein for which nowe hee see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to lay his hand vppon them; and yet that sinne beeing so plaine in it selfe, that a blinde man might easily finde it, and such as were of any remorse coulde not chuse but sorrow for it. Howe neuerthelesse it pleased GOD to helpe them, being now to be seen, we may the better perceiue it, if we haue any reasonable eie to these two: first how weakly it may seem to be set in hand withall by them; yet how strongly (by the goodnes of God) it did proceed. It may seeme to be but weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sette in hand-with (by <hi>Ester</hi> I meane) first for that shee was so vnwilling, at all to meddle with it: then also, when shee had vndertaken to assay what shee could doe. When she was so vnwilling at all to meddle with it, it is good to note,
<pb n="556" facs="tcp:7530:290"/> whereupon it was: and how she was informed therein. It was for that it lay vpon the perrill of her life, by the reason of an order the Kinges of <hi>Persia</hi> had, that none <note place="margin">Ibid. 10, 11.</note> should come vnto them vnlesse they were sent for, except that it pleased him to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done them when so they were come. The praetense whereof (no doubt) was for the safety of the Kings person: but the secret or chiefe meaning of it might bee, that his seauen Counsellers, and such as were neerest about him, might without interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion do what themselues would; yea and readily cut of such as they list, if they should repaire to the King to informe him of any thing against them. For, but saying his arrant (as wee tearme it) before, in such sort as they on their credit might, euen that onely might be enough to cut off any when he should come, though hee were as sak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse as might be. When she stucke vpon that danger, hee sendeth her such word <note place="margin">Ibid. 13, 14</note> againe, as might better informe her what she had to doe therein, first vrging her by strict necessity: then vsing some other reasons that were of force likwise to perswade, but yet not so forcibly vrging, as gently leading her thereunto. For first, he putteth her out of doubt, that it is her owne case aswell as others: so that shee could not es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape, if it proceeded against them, and were not staied. Then also making no doubt, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> but that God would send them helpe one way or other, that if she would not assay to do it, some other should haue the honour of it: but that it might be, that purposely God had brought her to that place, that shee should do it. A good and needefull consideration for all those that are in place of speciall opportunity to doe any good: such place it selfe witnessing vnto them, that therefore God hath giuen it vnto them, that they out of it should yeeld to the people of God, what such place wil at any time affoord. When now being heereby resolued to take it in hand, she set in hand with it, it seemeth she went but weakely about it, in that she had (as it might seeme) speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all good opportunity vnto it twice: and yet each of those times shee did differ it to some time ensuing. It is taken by others, as hauing some speciall policy in it, or as assured that God would afterward giue some better opportunity: but considering <note place="margin">Lyr. Con. Pellic Tremel. Iun.</note> how timerous naturally we are, when wee are to deale with personages of so speciall account, and so much the more if the cause be weighty, it seemeth to me, that time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rousnesse was more likely to be the cause of that her delay, than any thing else; saue onely for the former of them. For when at the first she found her selfe so welcome vnto the King, that she had promise to haue granted vnto her whatsoeuer she would <note place="margin">Ibid. 5: 1-4.</note> aske, euen to the one halfe of his Kingdome, but that <hi>Haman</hi> was now away, whom it seemeth shee thought good to haue in a readinesse when the matter should come in quaestion, so to make the readier dispatch of the businesse, this might seeme to bee as fit a time as she could haue wished: but seeing at this time hee was not there that we reade of, nor as it seemeth, therefore to such purpose, and in the course that shee intended, she might at this time very well thinke, that it was not so fit opportunity as she hoped ere long to haue. But the latter of those two times, when shee had <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ibid. 5-8.</note> at hand, altogether as ready and as fit to her purpose as she could haue wished (for any thing that appeareth to the contrary) and the King likewise now renewed his former offer vnto her, to grant her request, euen vnto the halfe of his Kingdome: that now she put it of againe till the next day, when as delay is in all reason, and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience too, so very dangerous in all such attempts, as hang on tickell and rare oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities, it cannot by any circumstance of Text, or by the best approued iudgements for the sounder course in such kind of dealing, bee so fitly ascribed to any thing else <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> (as I do take it) as to the common timerousnesse wee haue in all such cases, or as wee tearme it, that as yet her heart did not serue her. For that she had any purpose, so to <note place="margin">Lyra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Pellic.</note> deepe point of wisedome in her, and withall a notable moderation of her affections that could yet put of that, which full faine she would haue had: I for my part cannot conceiue, that eyther of them is so like as the other; as also, that shee was giuen to vnderstand from aboue, that within that time that she had now set downe, she should haue opportunity fit for her purpose, hath no warrant at all (that I can see) in the <note place="margin">Tremel. Iun.</note> Text it selfe. True it is, that next day she had (as thinges fell out in the meane sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son)
<pb n="557" facs="tcp:7530:290"/> a fitter opportunity then before, or yet shee had: at least the opportunity as fit as now (for such was the fauour of the King towardes her still, and in the selfe same <note place="margin">Ester 7: 1, 2.</note> tearmes deliuered vnto her) and much greater encouragement, by the honour that was done vnto <hi>Mordecay</hi> the same morning. But this was more than shee could know of, vnlesse it were extraordinarily imparted vnto her: but that wee finde not; and then is it not for vs so to determine. It seemeth rather, that God would there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by shew vs, how weake we are, and how readily our heart doth faile vs, to take such opportunities as God doth giue vs; especially, in such things as are good seruices to him, though those also do much import our selues: and yet, that hee doth not reiect vs in this our weaknesse, but onely leaueth vs so farre to our selues, as is sufficient to shew it vnto vs; and then himselfe worketh after his manner, to his owne glory, and to our comfort withall, and very admirably in both.</p>
            <p n="27">27 Now therefore to see how strongly by the goodnesse of God it did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> notwithstanding that great weakenesse of hers, as the danger they were in did first concerne <hi>Mordecay</hi> more specially; then also, all the <hi>Iewes</hi> or people of God generally: so the course or manner of Gods working for their good, was such, as first respected <hi>Mordecay</hi> more specially; then, all the rest of the people generally. For first as touching <hi>Mordecay,</hi> hee will not onely saue his life; but also bring him to great honour: and both these, in rare and speciall manner. His life hee praeserueth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> with the destruction of him that sought it; and hee bringeth him to the selfe same place of honour which his enemie had, but yet not all at once, but as it were by some degrees: first giuing him but some little tast of it; then, putting him in full possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereof. When he gaue him but some little tast of it, yet was it such (all things considered) as was a great and speciall benefit: being at such time bestowed on him, when his enemies had thought to haue swallowed him vp. Which that wee may the better perceiue, first wee haue set downe vnto vs, how they were deuising against him his vtter ruin: then, how God notwithstanding did euen then begin to aduaunce him. In their deuising against him, wee haue deliuered vnto vs, how a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them the matter was first debated: then, concluded. In the debating of it, himselfe doth first propound it vnto such company as there he had: and then do they giue him such aduise as they thought meetest. That he did now propound it to his friends there, it arose vpon a new discontentment that then hee tooke.

But com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming home, and calling his wife and other friends vnto him, there hee disgorged all vnto them: namely, that whatsoeuer earthly thinges he yet had (which himselfe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted vnto them, and acknowledged the same to bee great) yet they all did giue him no such contentment, but that the discontentment hee had by that stifnesse of <hi>Mordecay,</hi> still persisting in doing no such reuerence vnto him as others did, was more irksome vnto him, than that he could take any comfort in any of those thinges he had besides, or in all together. A very good patterne, both how a man may be enraged on the behalfe of his owne glory, when it is touched, though neuer so light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (for so was this case of his, beeing but one man among many thousands, that did not giue that honour vnto him; nor he of any speciall reckoning yet; nor doing any farther disgrace vnto him, but onely that he did him not that honour:) and how lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle contentment there is in any earthly externall goods, against a small perturbation <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> of the mind among men; and then is there much lesse in them, against the clamo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rousnesse of a guilty conscience towards God. The matter being thus by him pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, his company then were not long before they gaue in their verdit thereon: and it was, that he should first rid himselfe of that his griefe: and then might he more <note place="margin">Ibid. 14.</note> merrily goe with the King to the banquet. To rid himselfe of his griefe first, their aduise was, to get a Gibbet set vp (to be in a readinesse) and, the same of great heigth (according to the desire of the reuenge that was in him, so the better to satisfie the
<pb n="558" facs="tcp:7530:291"/> ranc or of it:) then, that hee should goe the next morning betime to the King, and begge <hi>Mordecay</hi> to bee hanged thereon; a matter that they (belike) did take to be most easie by the fauour the King did beare him, little acquainted (as it seemeth) with that higher ouer-ruling power in Heauen, or if they knewe it, yet in this case making no reckoning of it. This was no sooner mooued by them, but that it was liked by him: and so on all handes concluded among them. Woorke-men are presently set on woorke to make the Gibbet: they were nowe to waite but the next morning; and that night (no doubt) was long, yet short enough if they knew all. They hauing nowe gone almost as farre ar they can, and so wee being to see, how God euen now began to aduance him, the King that night, not being able to <note place="margin">Ibid. 6: 1-12.</note> sleepe, and by that occasion causing some of his Chamber to reade vnto him, they light on the place where it was recorded how <hi>Mordecay</hi> had saued the Kings lyfe, by detecting a conspiracie that two of his seruaunts had against him: whereuppon the King demaunding, howe that <hi>Mordecay</hi> had beene rewarded, and finding that nothing had beene done vnto him as yet, hee demaunded of <hi>Haman</hi> (who nowe was come to begge <hi>Mordecay,</hi> to bee graced with that high Gibet of his, the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of <hi>Haman</hi> nowe groaning for it) if in case hee were disposed to grace any man with speciall fauour, in what sort, by his aduise, hee best might doe it. <hi>Haman</hi> then, conceauing it must needes bee himselfe that the King did meane of, as if all the worlde were fully disposed still to goe with him, hee made the stake so fayre as hee could, making no doubt but hee should get it. The King well liked of his deuise, and bad him doe so to <hi>Mordecay;</hi> and not to faile in any thing that hee had spoken: and hee on the other side (but no doubt with an heauy heart, if hee might haue done otherwise) was faine to doe it; but when hee had done, hee liked so ill of his game then, that hee cast vp his cards, and got him away as fast as hee could, a sorrowfull man. A speciall good patterne, howe the prouidence of God <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> worketh here on earth among vs: and that he faileth not those that are his. For as touching his prouidence, when it still followeth the course of secondary causes, it is so ouer-shadowed with thē, that we do not lightly perceiue it: whereas here, thogh al things be done by men, yet see we nothing in al these maters but such as sheweth it selfe to be the peculiar work of God; al things do so concur together, and so fitly answer each other without any help (as it were) of any. That he faileth not those that are his, though it bee also in his dealing towards all his people there then; yet wee note it but only in that which is towards <hi>Mordecay</hi> now: and that especially to be a mean to stay vs from all inordinate aspiring to helpe our selues, when as that which God doth mean vs, himselfe doth so readily bring in when himselfe thinketh good, that our selues doe not at any time need to slip any seruice to God to goe about it. God had saued the life of the king by <hi>Mordecaies</hi> meanes; yet do we not find, that he took any occasion thereby (as vsing the means which God had giuen him: for that is the thing, vnder which we shroud our greedy scamblings) to make suit for any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence for that his seruice. When God again did now, vnwitting to him, put the king in mind of that his seruice, and framed his heart to shew himselfe thankfull for it, so that he had speciall honor done vnto him, and that by his mortall enemy, so that in it he might plainly see the hand of God extended to his preferment; yet, when he had all that honor done vnto him, he did not follow on that vaine to work farther on it (so to prosecute his good fortune, as men doe terme it) nor beare him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe the higher for it; but returned to the kings gate againe, not any place of cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit or charge as it seemeth, though some haue made such reckning of it (for besides <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Tremel.

But when hee did no better follow on it, then did it so follow on <note place="margin">Ibid. 2: 11.)</note> him, that euen that day, it seemeth, it presented it selfe fully vnto him. When <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> was so gotten home, hee recounted to his Wife and friendes howe sorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful an accident had that morning befaln him: and they on the other side were now so far from giuing him any comfort in that discomfortable case of his that now they

               <hi>Mordecay</hi> were a Iew before whom he had begun to stumble already. A good sentence to be marked in these dayes also: that they made such a reckoning of the fauour of God to that his people, that though God did afflict them some-times; yet when he beganne to vouchsafe them his fauour againe, and for their sakes to call their enemies to account of their doinges, then must the Enemy daily more and more be humbled, and his people more and more aduanced. For the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell in these daies hath an <hi>Haman</hi> in <hi>Rome,</hi> who long hath endeauoured to abolish it cleane (so farre as they haue thought good to stand against it) and to extinguish the memory of it. But in these dayes it pleaseth God to set in hand with the aduancement of the Gospell againe; and that <hi>Haman</hi> hath stumbled already. And his wiser Friends no doubt do see, and haue told him too, that the Gospel being of the Seed whereof it is, it is vnpossible for him to stand against it, and may look for none other, but dayly more and more to fall before it: While they were thus casting their losses at home, the time of the second dayes banquet approached, which <hi>Haman</hi> so little attended now (it seemeth, hee liked his game but ill) that <note place="margin">Ibid. 14.</note> the King was faine to send for him to come away: indeede a dismall banquet to him (though yet he saw nothing neere to the bottome of it, nor any others as yet: neyther the King whom the Issue of it was to passe, nor so much as <hi>Mordecay</hi> nor <hi>Ester</hi> neyther, who were to reape much benefit by it) but a ioyfull banket to others: and that very time, when God would now giue to <hi>Mordecay</hi> the full pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session or fruition of that, whereof he gaue him but a tast before. For at the ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket, <note place="margin">Ibid. 7: 1 10</note> when the King againe would know what was the suit that <hi>Ester</hi> had, promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing now also as great fauour therein as before hee had done, and <hi>Ester</hi> thereupon told him, it was but the assurance of her owne life, and of her people that she desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, shewing him withall in how praesent danger they were by <hi>Haman</hi> there prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent: the King then was so thoroughly mooued against <hi>Haman,</hi> who had so much <note place="margin">Ibid. 8: 1.</note> abused him therein, that praesently hee tooke his Signet from him, and so put him out of authority, and office thereby, and soone after gaue sentence of death on him, and to be hanged (at his owne doores) on that very Gibet, that himselfe had prouided to hang <hi>Mordecay</hi> on. The Enemy being thus taken away, then the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> King both gaue vnto <hi>Ester Hamans</hi> house: &amp;, when she acquainted the King how neere <hi>Mordecay</hi> was vnto her, he then committed his Signet to him, and put him <note place="margin">Ibid. 8: 1, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="28">28 Thus farre did the course of Gods working respect <hi>Mordecay</hi> chiefly: and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> now are we to consider of it, as it respected the rest of the people generally. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which deliuerance of theirs, the Story doth so deliuer it vnto vs, as occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioneth vs to consider, not onely what it was in it selfe; but also what it was vnto them, or as they esteemed of it. As it was in it selfe, it resteth in two principall points: one, as it was graunted of the King; another, as it was wrought foorth by by them. As it was graunted by the King, it was not the reuoking of that heauy <note place="margin">Ibid. 8: 3-14.</note> sentence that by <hi>Hamans</hi> meanes had passed against them before (the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe acknowledging that hee might not so doe, that beeing a thing that was alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether against their Lawes or manner of gouernment) but an authorizing of them also to stand their owne defense against those that by the vertue of the former de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree should goe about to suppresse them; and not onely to defend themselues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them, but also to bee auenged on them, giuing them liberty therein both to destroy their persons, and to make spoyle of their goods. As it was wrought forth <note place="margin">Ibid 15-17 Ibid. 9: 1-16</note> by them, it is noted first, that it was great comfort and ioy vnto them that <hi>Morde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay</hi> one of themselues was so greatly aduanced, and that they had that liberty giuen them against their Enemies: then also, that according to the liberty giuen them, they euery where assembled themselues to be auenged on those that meant euill a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them. As touching which matter wee haue it more specially set downe what was done, first in all other places besides, throughout all the Dominions and Prouinces to him appertaining: then, in the Citty of <hi>Shusan</hi> it selfe, the royall Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="560" facs="tcp:7530:292"/> or seat of the Kingdome. In all the other Prouinces it is noted, that euen the Rulers and Gouernors themselues were fauourable to the <hi>Iewes</hi> in this businesse, for <note place="margin">Ibid. 9: 1-5, 16, 17.</note> that they vnderstoode of the greatnesse of <hi>Mordecay,</hi> and so were afraid to come in any suspicion with him: and that the <hi>Iewes</hi> destroyed of those that would haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed them, to the number of threescore and fifteene thousand, but that they neuer <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> medled with the spoyle, though they were vnto it authorized also (though many of ours without authority doe fall to the spoyle where least they should) and that this they did, all on a day, on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, the selfe same day that their enemies had gotten by the former decree, on which to haue destroyed them. In <hi>Shushan</hi> that which they did, may seeme to be the stranger, vnlesse there <note place="margin">Ibid. 9: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>-15</note> be some reason conceiued. For there when they had taken their pleasure, as it were, on the day appointed, and therein destroyed fiue hundred persons, and the ten sonnes of <hi>Haman</hi> besides (but heere also not medling with the spoyle) by Queene <hi>Ester</hi> they craued, that they might haue liberty, the next day also to doe the like: and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing that graunted vnto them they then destroyed three hundred mo; and hanged vp (for example and terror) those ten Sonnes of <hi>Haman</hi> that were slaine the day before. The reason why they desired another day there, and had it granted, is not set down: but it seemeth to bee implyed, that their enemies there, were not yet quieted or set downe, by the first daies worke; and therefore that another was thought to be need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. And very likely it is, that the <hi>Iewes</hi> being strangers there, and but captiues but a little before, were not suffered much to inhabite there, that being the chiefe Citty and the seat of the Kingdome then: and so that the <hi>Iewes</hi> being but few there in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison, and their enemies many, another daies execution there was needefull for them, to haue rest from those enemies that the former decree had set vp against them, which being obtained, then qucikly they got them rest from them all. What this deliuerance was vnto them, or how they esteemed of it, it is a matter plaine enough in it selfe: and yet is it good that wee doe more specially consider, in what sort them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues did testifie, how they were affected at it. For if we marke, we may note, that in such sort they did it, as both might witnesse what comfort and ioy it was vnto them; and withall might scorne the folly of others. What comfort and ioy it was vnto them, they shewed, first for that praesent: then also for the time to come. For that praesent they shewed it, in that they kept the next daies ensuing, the foureteenth <note place="margin">Ibid. 17-19</note> and fifteenth of that month with so great festiuity or reioycing as they did: the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth, for that rest they got from all their enemies generalry, on the thirteenth day before; &amp; the fifteenth, for that farther assurance therein, that they got in the chiefe Citty of all, the foureteenth day of that month also. For the time to come they did it, in that their Superiors ordained, and themselues agreed, that thence-forward <note place="margin">Ibid. 20-32</note> they would keepe those two daies with ioy and gladnesse: <hi>Mordecay</hi> first at that prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent writing to all the <hi>Iewes</hi> in all the Prouinces so to do; and then, both the Queene <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> and he againe the second time, setting downe a plaine decree for the due obseruing of them, to all their posterity ensuing. Those others whose folly therein they would scorne, were those their enemies, and especially <hi>Haman,</hi> the very ring-leader vnto them all: and that which they would scorne in them, was that their busie cyphering <note place="margin">Ibid. 24, 26, 28, 31, 32.</note> or casting of lots for a luckie day, wherein to doe this their intended feat, running ouer almost a twelue-month therein, that so they might light on a luckie day wherein to dispatch it. So they called these two feastiuall daies, <hi>Purim,</hi> or the daies of Lots, in scorne to those that had light on such daies, as whereon their owne deuise turned to bee so bloody, and reprochfull vnto themselues. A good example to vs, both to be carefull to commend the speciall fauours of God towardes vs, to all out poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity ensuing: and what account to make of that heathenish superstition, that some daies are such as afford no good successe vnto such businesse as wee haue to doe, and therefore to cast for some luckie day when we haue any speciall thing to do.</p>
            <p n="29">29 That farther Story that we haue of that state (indeede, not much) is part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> of the King himselfe; and partly of this great Officer of his now, <hi>Mardochaeus,</hi> or <hi>Mordecay.</hi> Of the King himselfe there be two thinges reported: one, that he laid <note place="margin">Ibid. 10: 1, 2</note>
               <pb n="561" facs="tcp:7530:292"/> a tribute on all the maine Land, and on the Islands of the Sea that were any part of his Dominions; the other that his power and greatnesse, were in the Chronicles of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Persians,</hi> recorded. Like lips, like Lettice againe. If there bee no worthier matter in him, but readily to lay vpon his people the burthen of such pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as Princes are wont sometimes to doe (more than they neede, but to keepe their people low, that so themselues may so much the easilier impose the yoke of some kind of seruitude on them) euen those Chronicles of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Persians,</hi> are suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient records of all his greatnesse: Chronicles, that are not extant now, nor haue beene these many ages already past; and if they were, yet of small credit, and in no great request, euen in the world. And whereas the iudgement of those daies was, that in comparison of those two other Kings of <hi>Persia</hi> that went immediately before him, <hi>Cyrus</hi> the one, <hi>Cambyses</hi> the other, allowing <hi>Cyrus</hi> to haue ruled as a Father, and <hi>Cambyses</hi> as a Lord, they did set downe this <hi>Darius</hi> to be, as it were, an Huckster, or one that made Money of all: it may bee, that the Spirit of God did now note that in him, as a principall part of his gouernment among them, to see that none of his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> escaped those paiments that he meant to impose vpon them. Men, indeed, are wont to bee discontented with such paiments as are iustly required; and so their censure may oft-times in such case be of no great reckoning, to touch the conscience of any: but if the Spirit of God do concur withall, improuing the course that of any is taken therein, then is there no quaestion, but that that censure is indeede to be fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Much better had it beene (so farre as hee had no neede to vrge them) rather as a Father, to haue beene so giuing vnto them, than taking of them, that his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse might rather haue beene recorded in the hearts of his people, than his greatnes in the Chronicles of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Persians.</hi> Of <hi>Mordecay</hi> who was but his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant, neuerthelesse there bee more honourable thinges reported: and first what hee was with the King; then what he was with his owne people. With the King he was <note place="margin">Ibid. 2, 3.</note> in so speciall fauour, that he did so greatly aduance him, that it also was entered into those Chronicles together with the greatnesse of the King himselfe: an argument of great probability, albeit we had no farther knowledge of him, that hee was a man of speciall great worth, whom so mighty a Prince as he, should so greatly aduance as to make him next to himselfe, being still a stranger vnto him, and, a little before, a cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue too. With his owne people the <hi>Iewes</hi> he was not onely great, but acceptable <note place="margin">Ibid. 3.</note> too, or of great price with them: and no maruell, because it is noted of him, that he procured the wealth of his people, and vsed to speake peaceably vnto them. A ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good token, that such of our great men are good, as are in speciall Authority vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their Prince, when they are of great price with the people also. But that can they not be, if they seeke aboue measure to gird them in daily more and more: or, if but in speech they deale roughly with them. We are all their owne people and bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theren now: but though we bee (so farre) all in one case: yet euer there are some, more specially to that reckoing appertaining (as the Ministery often, and the poore Commons euer) of whom there is more speciall regard to be had therein, &amp; in whose estate it is (lightly) vndoubtedly seene, whether those that are in speciall place vnder their Prince, be good or not. Which the more that at any time we finde, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter may we see, that God then doth draw vs vnto him by loue; and wee are so much the more to thanke him: and the lesse againe that we do at any time finde it, the more plain it is vnto vs, that God is then offended with vs; and therefore, that in such case, we are the more to examine wherein we are wrong, and then, amending the same so <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> far as we can, so to seeke vnto God for his farther fauour.</p>
            <p n="30">30 That one other thing, of which this Story of <hi>Ester</hi> doth giue vs good oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> likewise to consider, is not appropriate to this Story onely: but something appertaining to diuers other Stories of Scripture besides, as the people of God haue had some speciall dealing with Forraigne peoples. But because it is very praegnant heere, and the last of that sort (that are of any speciall moment) as I do take it, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thought I it meetest heere to be remembred.

In all which it seemeth, first that there was some fault in those writers: then also, that God may haue other meaning therein. The fault that may seeme to be in those writers, was, eyther of negligence, or else of malice. Of negligence it may be, that they being ignorant of God, and that the <hi>Iewes</hi> were his peculiar people, they did not regard to cast their eyes to any such matters: so that God might do many great thinges among them, and yet little or nothing regarded by them. Of malice it may be, that, because the <hi>Iewes</hi> were, for the most part, very odious to all other peoples, for that they were so diuided from all others in religious rites and ceremonies, and were in such sort to destroy the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naanites</hi> as they were commanded, and might not haue any speciall society with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers other peoples besides: therefore, whatsoeuer might tend to their commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or credit with others, that would they passe by and see not, and of the two ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther chuse to suppresse it, than to commend it to the knowledge of others. GOD also might doe it of speciall purpose, both to shew vs the defect of all such writers, that wee should not ouer-much trust vnto them, when they are so defectiue, as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting of such matrers dooth shew they are: and that hee would make triall of vs, whether we can trust that which it pleaseth him to deliuer vnto vs, though there be no body else to auow it besides.</p>

They professe likewise, that the occasion and argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that demaund doe lead them to bee of that opinion: and yet bring no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther matter for the occasion or argument of it that they conceiue, than the same whereon the others also doe build; sauing, that they account the nature of this demaund to bee such, as that in open sight it dooth no lesse, but much more ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaine, to those that were already returned, than vnto those that taried be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde. This they say; but bring no farther proofe of their opinion: and so is it so much the stranger, that they doe so easily sunder themselues from the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all others besides. Concerning which, it seemeth to mee, that for sufficient resolution heerein (that it should rather bee the quaestion of those that tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried behinde) wee neede goe no farther, but onely to marke the quaestion it selfe: and in what manner it was demaunded. The quaestion it selfe, may seeme rather to respect those that tarried behinde, than those that were come home, because the doubtfulnesse of the quaestion dooth not noely stand vpon the knowledge of the estate of those that were returned: but much more on want of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of it. For if it were knowne, that the Temple was builded, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth set vp againe (though but in some meaner measure) the doubtful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the quaestion were then no more, but onely on this: whether, seeing they tooke vppe those two fasting-dayes, one of them for the ruin of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> the other for the slaughter of <hi>Gedaliah</hi> (by whose vnseasonable taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way

               </gap>, when the Temple was buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and the common-wealth in some measure reared againe. But thus much of the quaestion concerned both sortes of them, as well those that were returned, as those that were not, and both alike. But now, if we goe farther, to consider whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of these two sortes were more likely to knowe the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>y, whether the Temple were yet builded, or any reasonable forme of a Common-Wealth obtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: there is no quaestion, but that those that were returned, were the likelyest to know best in what case those thinges were among them, and so needed they least to inquire for that matter. So falleth it out, that though in the former of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>se re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectes, it stand indifferent to eyther of them; yet in the latter it leaneth altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the one sort of them: nothing at all fitting those that are at home, to moue any quaestion that should depend vpon the not knowing of theyr estate there; but fitting the others maruellous well for that they were many hundred miles of, and might well be doubtful in what estate they were there, if they were not (for many of them) altogether ignorant of it. If we go to the manner of demanding that quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, that beareth witnesse much more cleerely, that it was the quaestion of those that yet were behind; and not of those that were already returned: euen only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they sent to the House of GOD in <hi>Hierusalem</hi> about it. For first there is no quaestion at all, but that this quaestion came from the whole body (as it were) of them: eyther of those that were returned; or of those that yet tarryed behinde. It could not so come from the body (or in common) of those that were returned, because many of them, and the cheefe part of them (for so many) did dwell in <hi>Hierusalem</hi> it selfe: and as for the residue of them, they also dwelt in such sort round about <hi>Hierusalem</hi> (euery one in theyr owne Citties at home) that if they would confer of any matter in common, there were no place so fit for them all to meete in, to conferre thereof, as <hi>Hierusalem</hi> it selfe. For since the time that <hi>Salmanassar</hi> placed those other peoples in the Cittyes of Israell, we neede not to doubt, but that they still kept theyr holde in those. So that when <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> these returned, they had (to speake of) but theyr wonted Cittyes to dwell in, those that belonged to <hi>Iudah</hi> and <hi>Beniamin:</hi> and those, it is knowne, compassed <hi>Hierusalem</hi> on euery side; and hadde theyr combyning or coupling together, as they were all but one body, no where so much as in <hi>Hierusalem</hi> it selfe. And when, a little after this, wee haue it more specially set downe, where the Iewes <note place="margin">Neh. 11: 25-30. <hi>Tremel. Iun.</hi>
               </note> that returned did now inhabit, euen those that are of opinion, that this quaestion was mooued by those that returned, doe neuerthelesse marke, that the Cittyes there named, did all appertaine eyther to <hi>Iudah,</hi> or to <hi>Simeon</hi> who mingled with them: as on the other side for <hi>Beniamin,</hi> the Text it selfe dooth witnesse, that <note place="margin">Ios. 18: 11.</note> theyr Cittyes did lye betwixt <hi>Iudah</hi> and <hi>Ioseph,</hi> (as indeede <hi>Ephraim</hi> lay on the North-side of them, euen as Iudah did on the South) closing vppe <hi>Hierusalem</hi>
               <note place="margin">Chr. Adrichom.</note> as it were in the bosome or middest of them both. But these Cittyes of <hi>Beniamin</hi> that now wee speake of, were I graunt those that were theyr porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on before: which neuerthelesse dooth not altar the case, for that wee haue no reason to conceiue they got any others now; but rather might bee glad if they had all those, or so many of them as now they needed. Then also, seeing it plaine, that they sent, euen that very sending dooth not so well square to those that returned, and in person so often repayred thyther them-selues as vnto those that yet were behinde: all those beeing at <hi>Hierusalem</hi> alreadie, as touching the bodie of them all, and none beeing distant thence but onely as they were particulars, and yet so very often repayring thyther too; and these onely, both in particulars, and in the whole bodie or communitie of them all, beeing absent from it, and the neerest of them far distant also. Being then resolued who they were that sent to <hi>Hierusalem</hi> about this matter, and so hauing the readier way now to come to the matter it selfe, wee are first to consider of the quaestion mooued by them: then of the aunswere that was giuen them from God. In the quaestion
<pb n="564" facs="tcp:7530:294"/> mooued by them, we are first to beginne with the occasion of it: and so to come to the quaestion it selfe. The occasion of it was, that they had taken vppe cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ing dayes before, which euery yeere of their owne accord they would ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue: themselues moouing the quaestion but of one; but the Lorde himselfe dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting <note place="margin">Zach. 7: 1-3</note> his Prophet to remember them of others also, praesently of one moe, and a little after of two other besides. Which Fasting-dayes of theirs are by the help <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
               <note place="margin">Ibid. 5. 8: 19</note> of <hi>Ieremy</hi> noted to be, one of them towardes the ende of one yeare: the others, all in the next yeare ensuing. That which was towards the end of the yeare, was in the tenth month thereof, what time the King of <hi>Babylon</hi> did first begin to besiedge <note place="margin">Ier. 52: 4.</note>
               <hi>Hierusalem.</hi> The others that were all in the next yeare following, were some of them by occasion of farther griefe for that which after befell to <hi>Ierusalem:</hi> and one of them for the pittifull slaughter of a worthy personage among them. That which befell to <hi>Hierusalem</hi> after, were two speciall calamities: one, to the Citty; another to the Temple. That which befell vnto the Citty, was in the fourth month <note place="margin">Ibid. 6, 7.</note> of the new yeare following: and it was, that then the enemies brake into the Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and got it, it beeing greatly distressed by Famine before. That which befell vnto the Temple, was in the next month following; and it was no lesse than the <note place="margin">Ibid. 12. 2 King. 25: 8</note> vtter ruine or destruction of it by Fire: the enemies putting fire vnto it; and it bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning foure daies long, before it was consumed with it. That worthy personage that was slaughtered so pittyfully, was <hi>Gedaliah,</hi> whom the King of <hi>Babylon</hi> had left to bee Gouernour to the people that remained: who accordingly gouerned them so wel, that as then they stood a people yet; so there was good hope that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him that they might haue doone so long, and haue beene in reasonable good case too. But then certaine loose Gallants came treacherously and slue him, as <note place="margin">Ier. 41: 1-3.</note> being too much for the <hi>Babylonians:</hi> whereupon soone after the Land was cleane rid of all the rest of them; and, so were they there, not only no Common-wealth, but also no people at all. Which calamity befell in the seauenth month next en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing. So their foure Fasting-daies, that nowe for many yeares they had euerie yeere kept, were on those daies, it seemeth, on which those calamities befel them: the siedge begun; the Citty gotten; the Temple burnt; and <hi>Gedaliah</hi> slaine. As touching the quaestion it selfe, whereas they had foure Fasting-dayes in all, and yet mooue the quaestion but of one of them onely, it shall bee good to consider, whereupon they may seeme to doe it: then, what it is they mooue concerning it. They may seeme to make choyce of that their first months fast, as most concerning God, because it was on behalfe of his house then consumed with Fire. For such is the nature of Hypocriticall, that is, of all our common or ordinary deuotion, to plead most on such thinges whereby it may most seeme, that wee haue made God <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> beholding vnto vs. That which they moue concerning it, is, whether they were stil to continue that wonted fasting of theirs, or whether now (as the world was men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with them) they might not leaue it; implying thereby, both that themselues made no doubt of it, but that so long as the House of God lay wast, or was buried in the ruines and rubble of it, so long as they had to obserue such a generall set and solemne sorrowing for it; but that now the cause of that their sorrowing being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away, that in their iudgementes they were tied vnto it still, but yet that they thought it to be their duty, first to acquaint him with it, and therein to doe as hee would haue them. Wherein we haue a plaine example, first that we may in time so intangle our selues in such voluntary obseruations, as that in the end, though they were but voluntary first, yet wee account them necessary after: and that then wee readily obtrude them to God, as for his sake being doone; and that, so if it please him, we are ready to continue them also. The answer that hereunto was giuen them of God, consisted of two principall points: one, concerning this that they speake of; the other, as touching some other thinges, nothing at all heere remembred by them. Concerning the matter that now they spake of, the effect of his answer is, that he neuer willed them so to do, &amp; so will haue no dealing at all with it now: but that it was their own doing before, and that (for him) they should now determine of it as they thought good; himselfe would in no wise medle with it. As touching those
<pb n="565" facs="tcp:7530:294"/> other thinges nothing at all remembered now by them, they are in effect, that they <note place="margin">Zac. 7: 4-12.</note> should haue had speciall regard to the word of God sent vnto thē by his Prophets before, &amp; haue behaued themselues wel one towards another; and that so they had pleased him indeed: but that they could neuer like to doe therein as he would haue had them; &amp; therfore that he careth as litle, for this their voluntary seruice in these. A notable place to teach vs two very good and needfull pointes: how carelesse we are of those things that concerne true godlines indeed, and neuerthelesse not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out deuotion in such waies as our selues do like of; and how little God regardeth those waies of ours, and euer turneth vs vnto those others that he requireth. And yet were it hard to finde any one worke of our voluntary worshipping whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, that in our owne iudgement were likely to bee more acceptable to God, than these fasting-dayes of theirs in such sort as they did take them vp at the first, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> and afterward vse them. For they tooke them vp at the first vppon seuerall great and pregnant tokens of the great displeasure of God against them for their sinnes: their head Citty besiedged; soone after taken; their Temple burnt; and the land dispeopled. In all which and in euery of them, they had good cause to stir vp them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues yearely to some speciall sorrow for so heauy an hand of God, so many wayes then laid vppon them. Their manner of doeing it was to seperate or with-drawe themselues for the time, from their delights and pleasures, and from their vsuall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires besides; and to giue themselues to some set sorrowing and lamentation; and many of them euen in sack-cloath and ashes, putting on such homely and base ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parrell, and so deforming themselues besides, as vnwoorthy any better reckoning with any. In all which their fasts, forbearing of meat for the time was an appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant, as the forbearing of their lawfull liberty in other things also for that present: but neither it, nor any of the others being so for the time forborne were of the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of their fasting, no, not in their owne iudgement) but onely their weeping and sorrowing, as their owne very words doe reasonable plainely witnesse vnto vs. For they doe not plead vppon their abstinence from meat, or on the forbearing of those other thinges that otherwise they might lawfully haue imployed themselues about, as but resting therein: but on that they wept and sorrowed, and that they <note place="margin">Zac. 7: 3.</note> seperated themselues from all other things, not as resting therein, but the better to helpe them forward in that other action which at such times they chiefly intended. Whereas on the other side our fastings, though the glory or flower of all the deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that many of vs haue, doe not consist of the substance of fasting: but onely in some appendant of it; and for the most part, but in sleight or easie manner. But if God did looke so strangely on these fastings of theirs, and would haue nothing to do with them: both the vsuall fastings, and many other voluntary worshippings, which were vsed in the power of darknesse, may goe whistle, as they say, for any fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uor they are like to find at the hands of God, for any thing they find in this patterne that now we are in.</p>

As touching which hard estate of theyrs, to the end that we may the better perceiue it, it shall be good, that first wee consider some-thing of it generally: and that then we come to the more speciall consideration of it. That which we are to consider thereof generally, is first within what bounds our matter lieth: then what is the matter it selfe. The bounds of our matter are, partly in the time, and partly in the parties thereunto appertaining. The compasse of time that now we speake of, is some part of it while those yet stood vnder whome as yet they were: the rest, vnder others. Those vnder whom as yet they were, were the <hi>Persians,</hi> whose state is noted to haue stood somewhat better than two hundred yeares in all: but, about one hundred thirty and fiue of those being now spent already since their returne, it remaineth, that wee haue no moe of that state of theirs but onely about threescore and twelue.

Those others vnder whome they afterward were, were the <hi>Graecians</hi> first: and the <hi>Romanes</hi> after. Vnder the <hi>Graecians</hi> they were soone after that that state got vp: and it stood about two hundred threescore and seauen yeares. Vnder the <hi>Romanes</hi> they were likewise soon after that they came to their heigth; and much longer than that part of their story that now wee are in, doeth reach vnto: but after that these got vp, it was about threescore yeares, before that the story of Christ be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth. So may we note, that the compasse of time that this our story lyeth in, is almost foure hundred yeares. The parties hereunto appertaining are the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God: and those that were so grieuous vnto them. As touching the people of God, we are to note, that now they all go vnder the name of <hi>Iewes,</hi> though of the other tribes besides there were diuers mingled with them; and not vnlikely, but that some of the <hi>Canaanites</hi> did so likewise: but, of whatsoeuer people or Nation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them were, it seemeth they were all of one profession, and so were accounted all one people. Wherein it is not amisse to note, that whereas in <hi>Salomons</hi> time <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> when the Temple was to bee builded (and that beeing the time, when that state of theirs was at the highest) there were found to be in the Land one hundred fifty and <note place="margin">2. chr. 2: 17, 18 1 kin. 5: 15, 16</note> three thousand strangers (which seeme to bee all, or the most part of them, <hi>Canaa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites,</hi> the auncient inhabitants of the Land) and now we haue no mention of any of them; but that the peculiar people of God were now the inhabitants of that land: yet neuerthelesse, as the people of God together with those <hi>Canaanites</hi> before, had according to the Prophecy and curse of <hi>Noah</hi> beene seruaunts to the posteritie of <hi>Sem;</hi> so the people of God onely nowe, inhabiting that land, were vnder that part of the curse to others of the posterity of <hi>Sem</hi> at this present, and afterward againe to two other states of <hi>Iaphets</hi> progenie. And seeing they offended so much as they did, lesse maruaile it is, that they inhabiting that Land nowe, haue part of the curse that was giuen foorth against their predecessours before: as also it may seeme, by that which followeth after, that that part of the curse was so farre laid on the Land it selfe (for the others were in no such subiection yet to any of the posterity of <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet)</hi> as that it might be of force against those inhabitants also. Those that were so grieuous vnto them, were, first the latter of these two states or Monarchies, that were in the East part of the worlde, of the posterity of <hi>Sem:</hi> then these other two that were in this North-west part of the world (which wee inhabit) both of them being of the posterity of <hi>Iaphet;</hi> the other part of the knowne world, beeing peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled most by the posterity of <hi>Cham,</hi> hauing none of those foure Monarchies in it, but so farre pertaking (in effect) with that curse aforesaide, though by name it were layd on <hi>Canaan</hi> onely, no ancestours of theirs, but onely hauing one and the selfe same auncestor common to them both. The latter of those two States or Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies that were in the East-part of the world, and of the posteritie of <hi>Sem,</hi> was that of the <hi>Persians,</hi> vnder which they were yet: and the estate of the people of God vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der these is no more in effect (some few particulars only excepted) but that so long as these did yet stand (which we heard, was but about threescore and twelue yeares more) they were in subiection vnto them; but yet both had a Gouernour of their
<pb n="567" facs="tcp:7530:295"/> owne people, and were allowed the freedome of their owne profession. The particulers wee speake of, are but two; and both of them such as much respected the whole estate of the people: one of them, of a taxe or fine imposed on them; the other, of a great stumbling blocke in Religion reared vp among them. That <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> taxe or fine that was imposed on them, was by occasion of a foule murther com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by <hi>Iohn</hi> the High-Priest himselfe, on IESVS his owne brother, and that euen in the Temple too: the occasion beeing for that hee which was slayne, did set <note place="margin">

That Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour therefore both polluted their Temple, and imposed a fine vppon them for seauen yeares together. That stumbling blocke in cause of Religion that was reared vp among them, was neare vppon the end of the <hi>Persian</hi> State: done also by a brother of the High-Priest that then was, a bad man; and the very same, it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, that <hi>Nehemiah</hi> for his profane marriage chased away from him. The mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <note place="margin">Neh. 13: 28 <hi>Ant. li.</hi> 11. <hi>ca.</hi> 8</note> was, that <hi>Manasses</hi> beeing Priest also himselfe, and hauing before administred the Office and dignitie of Priest-hood with <hi>Iaddus</hi> his brother, but afterward bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in great disgrace at <hi>Ierusalem</hi> for that his bad marriage, by the helpe of <hi>Sanbal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let</hi> his Father in lawe the Lord of <hi>Samaria,</hi> hee erected another Temple in Mount <hi>Garizin</hi> neere to <hi>Samaria,</hi> like to that which was at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and himselfe was High-Priest there: many of the Priestes such as had polluted themselues with such vnlawful marriages, &amp; others of the people such as eyther had so married, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise for some bad parts of theirs were called to reckoning at <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> and finding readie entertainment there, leauing <hi>Hierusalem</hi> and the true woorshippe of God behind them, and ioyning themselues to this vp-start profanation, arising out of the proud heart of that grand sectarie the High-Priests brother.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Of those two others that were of the posteritie of <hi>Iaphet,</hi> the former of them <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> was that of the <hi>Graecians:</hi> the other, that of the <hi>Romaines</hi> that followed. That of the <hi>Graecians,</hi> for a while, was one entire State: but soone after, much deuided a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themselues. It was one entire state but onely for the time of <hi>Alexander</hi> himselfe, who raigned in all but about twelue yeares: part thereof, but in <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donia</hi> and <hi>Greece</hi> whence hee came; the residue in <hi>Asia,</hi> where hee ouer-threw the <hi>Persian</hi> State, and set vp his owne. In whose story, or in the compasse of whose time wee haue no more to consider, that dooth properly appertaine to our present purpose, but onely in what estate the people of GOD were vnder him: but seeing he was at the first so notable a Prince, and for his conquests was set on by God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> it shall not bee amisse, first to consider of some fewe other stories of him go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before; and then of the estate of the <hi>Iewes</hi> vnder him. Those other stories that now I speake of, are two: one, while yet he was in <hi>Macedonie;</hi> the other, so soon as he was ariued in <hi>Asia.</hi> While yet he was in <hi>Macedonie,</hi> being then purposed to go to warfare in <hi>Asia,</hi> he either took short, while he was there, or tooke away with him when hee went thence, all such as hee doubted to bee aspiring, and might hazzard him of his kingdome at home, while he was abroad: a good example for all the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunts of GOD, the Souldiours of Christ, first to take short all their inordinate af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of flesh and bloud, or to keep a strong hand on them, when we go forth to the warfare of a Christian life. In <hi>Asia</hi> as soone as hee ariued, and considered on the goodnesse and largenesse of that part of the world, making no doubt but to win it and make it his owne; hee thereuppon then parted and freely gaue <hi>Macedonie</hi> his former kingdome to his Captaines and friends, as hauing enough and enough in <hi>Asia</hi> for him: another faire example for the Childeren of GOD, after that by the knowledge of Christ, they vnderstand how good things are laid vp for them in the world to come, more easily to part with these earthly things heere, to goe and gain others vnto that other fellowship with them; at least to take heede, that in the loue of these earthly felicities they doe not moow-vp or burie themselues. The estate
<pb n="568" facs="tcp:7530:296"/> of the <hi>Iewes</hi> vnder him was good, for that although hee came towardes them with great displeasure, for that (on alleagiance to their former Lords) they sent him no aide to the winning of <hi>Tyre,</hi> as he had required them to doe: yet after perceauing it was the God whome they professed, who had set him a-worke, and had prospered him so farre therein, he was very gracious vnto them, and bestowed great immuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties on them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. When the Graecian State was diuided <hi>(Alexanders</hi> Captaines, after his death, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> he hauing no issue, parting the same among themselues) though they were moe at the first, and afterward the chiefe of them, foure: yet were they but two (themselues, and their successours) who had such dealing with the <hi>Iewes,</hi> as that we neede to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire to their storie, to finde out in what estate the <hi>Iewes</hi> then were. And those two were, such as had, one sort of them, <hi>Egipt</hi> on the South; the other, <hi>Syria</hi> on the North of the people of God: not, that either of them had no moe Countries be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides vnder their gouernment; but that those were the chiefe to either of them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides such others as they had withall, sometimes moe, sometimes fewer. Of these <note place="margin">Dan. 11: 5-9 11, 13-15. 25, 40.</note> two (whome the Angell in <hi>Daniell</hi> calleth, the one, the King of the South; the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the King of the North) it was the King of the South, or that Southern part of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> the Graecian Monarchy that had dealing with the <hi>Iewes</hi> first; but that other Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern part soone after: and so I hold it best that we consider of either of them seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally. So beginning first with that part of the Graecian Monarchy which lay to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the South, there may we note, that sometimes the Princes thereof did make head against the <hi>Iewes</hi> to doe them some hurt: and that once the <hi>Iewes</hi> themselues did so prouoke them, as that they were in great daunger thereby. Those Princes made head against the people of God to their hurt, twice: the hurt that both times they made, being requited, as it were, with some speciall fauour towards them soon after. The former of those hurts was, that <hi>Ptolomaus Lagi,</hi> the first of those Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ioseph. Antiq. lib.</hi> 12, <hi>cap.</hi> 1</note> that enioyed that State, comming to <hi>Ierusalem</hi> as in peaceable manner, to offer Sacrifice, and on a Saboth day, surprised the Citty, and both dealt hardly with them there, and tooke away many of them captiues also: a matter that was by <hi>Agathar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chides</hi> an other Author of those dayes reproachfully laid to the charge of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> as thogh they had of superstitious cleauing to their own ease that day, suffered him so to possesse himselfe of their Citty; and so had dearely bought that little ease of theirs then, by taking vpon their shoulders so vneasie and heauy a Lord, as hee was afterward like to prooue vnto them. The fauour wherewith this was, as it were soone after requited vnto them, was partly by himselfe: but more by him that next succeeded. Himselfe conceauing by the answere they gaue to <hi>Alexander</hi> before, (when hee sent vnto them to come into his aid, they refusing so to doe, on the oath they had made to their former Princes) that they had good regard to their oaths, put many of them in so speciall trust with his holds, and did so much enfranchize them besides in the head Citty of all his kingdome, that many others of the <hi>Iewes</hi> besides, on this good dealing of his with their brethren, of their own accord, came and yeelded themselues to dwell vnder his alleageance. The fauor they found in him that next succeeded <hi>Ptolomaus Pliladelphus,</hi> was such, as that I can hardly think that any in these dayes of the Gospell that wisheth well to the aduancement there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, can reade it, without a sound and speciall shame of these our dayes. Being a <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ioseph. Antiq. lib.</hi> 12. <hi>cap.</hi> 2.</note> Prince that was giuen to the loue of learning, and hauing then already gotten two hundred thousand Bookes to his Library, and beeing in the way soone after to get fiue hundred thousand moe vnto them, or at least to make them vp so many in all; and yet not so content, but farther desiring to get vnto him besides all the bookes of the Law of God by the helpe of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> and to haue them translated into the tongue that was then most common to all: to obtaine his desire therein (of which notwithstanding as yet he had but heard by report of others, nothing answerable <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> to the woorth of the thinges themselues) it may stand for one of the chiefe miracles of the world, to see how that heathen Prince behaued himselfe therein, how graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously and liberally hee first dealt with those <hi>Iewes</hi> that then were in bondage in
<pb n="569" facs="tcp:7530:296"/> those his dominions, redeeming out of his owne treasure aboue an hundered and twenty thousands of them; howe great and rich gifts hee sent first likewise to the Temple at <hi>Ierusalem:</hi> what Interpreters, and how many he sought to haue thence; in how good manner hee sought to haue them; how welcome they were vnto him when they were come; how honourably and howe carefully to that purpose, they were entertained when they where there; how liberally they were rewarded; and how graciously dismissed when they had done. Wee haue better knowledge in these dayes of ours (or more shame for vs) of the Gospell of Christ; we need not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen our owne treasuries, of that which is (by vndoubted right) clearely our owne; we need but restore that which (no doubt) many of vs doe, in our own consciences vniustly with-hold; they are no forreine people to vs, but our our owne bretheren, that need to be by vs redeemed; their bondage is incomparably much greater, and more to bee pittied, than was that of those others: and yet how vntoward wee are herein; how little desire we haue of any such help; and how little we esteem of those by whome we might haue it, and by whome we haue whatsoeuer of that kinde it is that we haue, no man can be of mind to deliuer, but that presently hee findeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe ouer-whelmed with it. The latter of those hurts was about an hundred yeares after the former, or somewhat better; this latter of them, by the course of the story <note place="margin">Tremel.

The thing it selfe was, that this King <hi>Ptolomaus Philopater</hi> comming peaceably to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and orderly offering his sacrifices there, seeing the Temple so beautiful a building as it was, and thereupon offering to go into it, and euen into the inmost place it selfe, because he was first but diswaded by those that were present, but then forcibly stayed by the strong and strange hand of God himselfe, he grew so greatly discontented therby, &amp; so deeply displeased with the <hi>Iewes,</hi> as that thence-forward shee resolued vtterly to destroy them all, within his dominions, and that with a cruell and a strange kind of death. Which being twice attempted, was as often in easie manner by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> of God defeated: first the king himselfe ouer-sleeping his owne appointed time; then, by a strong and strange obliuion, of that which he had before determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. When the third time notwithstanding he would yet set in hand with it again, and more eagerly than before, he was then not only by outward forcible meanes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated: <note place="margin">

The fauor that after this did follow vpon them, was, not onely that he remitted and vtterly abandoned all that his displeasure against them: but also vouchsafed them diuers speciall fauors. When the <hi>Iewes</hi> themselues did so prouoke them, as that they were in great danger thereby, it was in the daies of this king also: <hi>Onias</hi> the High-Priest, the <hi>Iewes</hi> chiefe gouernour then vnder him, being so strongly giuen to his owne priuate, that very much hee had wronged the publique cause; had not another in his roome stoode vp in the gap <hi>(Iosephus</hi> a Nephew of his, of speciall good parts) against that dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>

At which time the <hi>Iewes,</hi> fiding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues more specially to him, were vouchsafed speciall fauours (and those by good record) both at home and abroad. When afterward the Princes or Gouernours of this Northerne State were grieuous vnto them, first it was, but, as it were, a push for the time: but afterward it sate neerer vnto them. While it was but a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> storme of small continuance, and soone after blowne ouer againe, it was no more <note place="margin">2 Mac 3: 4-40</note> but that one <hi>Simon,</hi> a treacherous person from among themselues, was, by <hi>Apollo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> the occasion, that a speciall attempt was made by <hi>Heliodorus,</hi> sent frō <hi>Selercus Soter,</hi> and so euen by the higher power it self to haue made a spoile of the Temples treasure: which notwithstanding is noted to be so very strongly and strangely resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted, not by the people themselues, but by a strange extaordinary protection, that such as came for it, went away without it, and were glad too they had so escaped. When it sate neerer vnto them, and had longer continuance among them, theyr dealing then grew to be so grieuous and so intolerable, that it made an alteration of the State it selfe: and so are we therein to consider, first of that dealing of theirs against them; then, what alteration in the State it was, that came in thereby. Their dealing against them, though exceeding bad in it selfe; yet may it seeme to be iustly occasioned: and so are we first to note how it was occasioned; then, what it selfe was. Iustly occasioned we may account it to be, for that in those dayes <note place="margin">2 Mac. 1: 12-16. 2 Mac. 4: 1-17 <hi>Ioseph. Antiq. lib.</hi> 12. <hi>cap.</hi> 6</note> mingling with the Heathen, many of them nowe gaue vp their former profession of the Lawe of God, and betooke themselues to the waies of the Heathen: and that mnny of the Priestes themselues did now make no reckoning of the Temple, nor of the seruice of God that was there to be vsed; and were besides fouly giuen to much disorder. What the dealing it selfe was, whereof they had experience now, that we may in few wordes the better see, wee are to know, first that it was whatsoeuer mighty and grieuous enemies are in such case wont to doo: then, that there was much more euill inflicted on them, than such dealing of the Enemies dooth (for the most part) reach vnto. That which was but such as in such case grieuous enemies are woont to doe, was, that they did exceedingly spoyle, euen the Temple it selfe, both of the treasure and ornamentes of it: and that they did <note place="margin">1 Mac. 1: 21-24, 20-42. 2 Mac. 5: 11-16, 21-26. <hi>Ioseph.

That which was more, was, that both they forced them from the Law of God; and destroyed, both so many of the Books thereof as they could get, and so many of the people (without respect of age or sex) as would not yeeld: and both aduanced most detestable Idolatry; and strongly vrged (nay, violently rather) the people vnto it.</p>
            <p n="5">5 The alteration in the States that came thereby, was great: and such as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> much respected, not onely these their enemies; but also, euen the Iewes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues withall.

In the former of these, the doubt it selfe is, that in diuers places of the Prophets there are such speeches giuen forth to the people, as may seeme to import, that after their returne from <hi>Babylon,</hi> or in the compasse that now we are in, they should haue another manner of estate than yet wee haue heard of: and such may we finde, both while <hi>Ierusalem</hi> and the Temple yet stoode, before the Captiuity; and when the people were deliuered thence, and returned home a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. While <hi>Ierusalem</hi> and the Temple yet stoode, one place onely may bee suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient in steede of the rest, appertaining to the compasse of time, wherein <hi>Iotham,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Micah. 1: 1.</note>
               <hi>Ahaz</hi> and <hi>Hezekia,</hi> Kinges of <hi>Iudah,</hi> raigned: the two former of whom (especially the latter of them) were such, as committed such things, as for which the iudgements of God came vpon them; but the last of them taking a much better course. For <hi>Iotham</hi> was the last of the three that did shew the State to bee declining, they being so giuen to their priuate, that it is no maruell though the greater sort following their example, became so grieuous in that kinde vnto the meaner sort of the people, as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers others, and this our Prophet doth much complaine: the other was both Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous, and bloody too. The place it selfe is, that charging them first to haue much offended, and for the same denouncing great desolation to their chiefe Citty and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>

When the people were deliuered thence, and returned home, <hi>Hag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gay</hi> or <hi>Aggaeus</hi> the Prophet, encouraging the Elders of the people that then were, &amp; the people themselues, cheerefully to build the Temple that then they had in hand, <note place="margin">Agge. 2: 5-10</note> assureth them of a strange beauty whereunto that Temple should shortly attaine; and of a State they should haue aboue all the Kingdomes of the earth: and for the latter of these, they are by another likewise assured, that it should bee such a State, as both <note place="margin">22-24. Zac. 9: 10.</note> should giue place vnto others (and then must it needes bee superior vnto them) and be of so large limits it selfe, as that it should be from Sea to Sea, and from the Riuer to the end of the Land. Diuers such other places there are: in all which our reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution must be to sequester our expectation from all earthly and momentane things, which are but shadowes; and to fasten it on those that are glorious indeede, &amp; those eternall (according to the nature of him that made the promise of them:) a full ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishment whereof we haue in Iesus Christ.</p>
            <p n="2">2 The latter of them is of a principall part of that blessing, that <hi>Iacob,</hi> in the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> spirit of Prophecy, gaue vnto <hi>Iudah</hi> his fourth Sonne: namely, that the Scepter (or <note place="margin">Gen. 49: 10</note> Tribe) should not depart from <hi>Iudah,</hi> nor a Law-giuer from betweene his feete, till <hi>Shiloh</hi> should come, and that the people should be gathered vnto him. The doubt that hence may arise vnto vs, is out of the common vnderstanding of it: and the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thereunto laid. For the common vnderstanding of it is, that the meaning of it is to signifie, what time the promised Sauiour should come into the world: and that the time should be, when the authority or gouernment should bee taken away from the Tribe of <hi>Iudah,</hi> which it had from <hi>Dauids</hi> time, eyther more or lesse, till a little before the comming of Christ; but that being cleane taken away then, it was a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, that Christ was at hand. And true it is indeede, by good warrant of Scripture, that <hi>Dauid</hi> was of that Tribe; and that hee or some of his line raigned ouer some of the people of God, vntill the Captiuity, and that he who was their Gouernour (vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>Persians)</hi> when they returned, was likewise of that Tribe, and of <hi>Dauids</hi> line: and that our best Authours for those matters do shew, that afterwardes also, till the <hi>Maccabees</hi> stept vp, those that were their chiefe Leaders vnder the <hi>Persians</hi> and <hi>Grae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians,</hi> were of that Tribe and line too; and that, while the <hi>Maccabees</hi> were in place, that their Bench of those threescore and ten Elders, were of the House of <hi>Dauid</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and that they stoode till towardes the very end of <hi>Herods</hi> raigne. But now if we lay the Story to this sense of the place, we do not finde, by vndoubted warrant,
<pb n="575" facs="tcp:7530:299"/> that which may so fully cleere it: and so are we therein, first to consider how far the Story attributeth the gouernment to others; then, how this place that wee speake of may safeliest be taken. The Story we may note to attribute the Gouernment of the people, as by the appointment of God, but onely once before <hi>Dauids</hi> time to the Tribe of <hi>Iudah:</hi> we knowing none that was any Gouernour of them so long as they were in <hi>Aegypt</hi> after the death of <hi>Iacob</hi> (who is out of the compasse) but onely of <hi>Ioseph</hi> for his time, then <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> after, who were all three of other Tribes.

King. 11: 43.</note> Tribe, and but the lesser of the Tribe of <hi>Iadah;</hi> but when they came together again, then were they all vnder that King of the Tribe of <hi>Iudah,</hi> and vnder another of that line, euen hee that next succeeded. When they were diuided againe, not onely of themselues, but of the ordenance of God concurring, the greater part of them had their Kings againe of other Tribes; and but the lesser onely, of the Tribe of <hi>Iudah:</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. King. 12: 1- 2. King. 17: 41 1 Kin. 12: 20-2. Chr. 36: 21. 2. kin. 11: 1 21</note> which succession (euen in it too) was likewise interrupted or broken off, for a:+bout sixe yeares, by a bad Woman, and a meere stranger vnto them. Vnder for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine powers were that lesser part of the people (who were all that now remained) first out of their owne Land: then also, at home. Out of their owne land, while they were in captiuity, that estate of theirs is not like to affoord, that they had any of their owne Nation gouernours ouer them: their King himselfe for most of that time beeing in prison. At home, it is plaine, that still they were vnder forraigne powers: and then is it not much more materiall, that for part of that time they had vnder-gouernours of their own; than that afterward they had none but others, first but of another Tribe, then meere strangers vnto them. How we may best resolue as touching this also, to the end that we may the better finde, it seemeth to me, that the best and the readiest way is, first to go to the originall it selfe: then to make what sense it is, whereunto it most inclineth. In the originall it selfe most of the matter hangeth on one word onely, which may be taken, either for a Rod, Staffe or Scepter; or else for a distinct Tribe, stocke or Family: and so is it accordingly interpreted, or
<pb n="576" facs="tcp:7530:300"/> taken diuersly. If we take it for a Scepter (the chiefe and principall of those rods or staues, which also it may signifie) then we plainely see, that the Story discouereth, that since that Oracle was vttered, both the Tribe of <hi>Iudah</hi> hath often beene without it; and that it was bestowed on diuers others: then may wee in like sort note, that the words which next do follow of the Law-giuer that should euer be among them, do import, in a manner, the selfe same thing; and therefore that those may seeme to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge that former of that conceiued sense, and to allot it to that other, if so it may be conueniently taken. But on the other side, if we take it for a Tribe, as if those words did note, that howsoeuer it should bee with them after, yet should they bee a distinct Tribe till the promised Sauiour should come, both it hath a sufficient diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence from that which followeth next after: and euery where doth the Story accord therewith, throughout the whole.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Howbeit, whethersoeuer of these two readings we take, there is no quaesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> but that it may very well stand, and be strong against the <hi>Iewes,</hi> to shew that their promised Sauiour is come already, whether wee take that word to meane a Scepter; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> or, whether we take it to meane a Tribe: and so it shall bee good in either of these to consider, first, how that sense it selfe will arise; then, of what force it may be vnto others. In the former of those that sense will well arise, if wee can take it, that by that Scepter and Law-giuer, he would haue them to know, that God would so order the mater, or haue so carefull an eye towardes them, as that howsoeuer it went with the other Tribes besides; yet should they haue a tolerable estate, euen vnto the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of Christ: and that doth the Story thoroughly witnesse. The force of this sense towards others, is such, as that it giueh good instruction, first to them all in the meane season: then specially, to so many of them as remaine, after the desolation of that common estate of them all, that long they enioyed. The instruction that it gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth to them all in the meane season, is, that seeing that Tribe should be in so good, or at least in tolerable estate vntill the comming of Christ: therefore neyther should they refuse to take vpon them the ouer-sight or gouernment of the rest, when it should orderly come vnto them, nor diuide themselues from their bretheren, least that so they depriued them of such benefits as by their society or vnion with them, they might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy; neyther should any of the others especially, withdraw themselues from them, for that so they should depriue themselues of that good (or tolerable estate, euen at the worst) that with them they might haue enioyed. Whereby if we examine certaine passages of theirs, or some of those matters that already were passed among them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, wee may finde, first that it may seeme, the Tribe of <hi>Iudah,</hi> or at least the chiefe Fathers or Princes thereof were at one time much to blame: and that others of them very plainely offended. The chiefe Fathers of <hi>Iudah</hi> were much to blame, when <note place="margin">Iud. 1: 1-3.</note> soone after the death of <hi>Ioshua,</hi> inquiring of the Lord who should be their Leader a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst their enemies, and the Lord answering that it should bee <hi>Iudah,</hi> neuerthelesse (so farre as wee reade) they did not take vpon them ouer the whole, or on behalfe of them all: but onely after a more priuate manner, making head or addressing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues against their owne priuate enemies, such of the <hi>Canaanites</hi> as yet remained within their Borders; to that end both desiring the helpe of the <hi>Simeonites</hi> against those (whereas now they were put in such place, as by vertue whereof they might haue commanded ouer all) and promising the like against those those that yet were within the <hi>Simeonites</hi> Borders. Whereunto if we lay, how troublesome and pitifull estate the people had all the time following (in a manner) till it pleased God againe to set the Tribe of <hi>Iudah</hi> in place to such purpose, their ouer-sight heerein may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare so much the greater: especially, if they could call to minde withall, how <hi>Iacob</hi> had behight them such a praerogatiue so long before. Those others of them that plainely offended, were, partly <hi>Abner,</hi> the Generall of <hi>Saule</hi> (who was the occasion) <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> and all the other Tribes besides yeelding thereunto, in that they diuided themselues <note place="margin">2. Sam. 2: 8, 9.</note> then from the Tribe of <hi>Iudah;</hi> especially, when as now they plainely saw, that God had set vp one of the Tribe of <hi>Iudah</hi> to bee their King, and that the same was a man of great worth, and of great Atchieuments already: but most of all, ten of those
<pb n="577" facs="tcp:7530:300"/> Tribes againe, immediately after the raigne of <hi>Salomon,</hi> making such another diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion <note place="margin">1 King. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Sam. 7: 12-16.</note> great) promises made. The instruction it giueth to those that remaine, after that now their former State is long since so cleane ouerthrowne, is an irrefragable conui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction vnto them, that there Messias is come already: themselues not beeing able to deny, first, but as God heereby did promise them some reasonable good estate, till their Messias should come among them, so they had it till Christ in his owne person had beene with them, and till by his Apostles and Disciples hee had farther acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted himselfe with them, and drawne in many of the Gentiles vnto him; then also, that soone after that time, all the good estate they had, went backe-ward daily more and more, till it fell downe cleane to the ground, and so hath euer since remained. In the latter of them, the sense likewise dooth well arise, not onely, because the ory<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall it selfe giueth that sense also as well as the other, and is so likewise interpreted by diuers of very good note: but also, because that people had diuers waies good cause to haue speciall respect to the distinction of their Tribes; and to the Tribe that now we speake of, most of all others. Which sense also is of like force, as the other before, to shew that Christ (whom yet they expect) is long since come against them already: the word of God being plaine, that they should not faile to bee a Tribe till then; and themselues knowing, that for that time they were so indeede, both in that relation they had to others of their Brethren, and in themselues too, but that so they are not now in respect of eyther. Insomuch that the Iewes themselues (as one of their owne company hath noted) are not able now to discerne, who are of that Tribe, and <note place="margin">Tremel. Iun.</note> who are not: themselues, and the remnants of those other Tribes that were left, so intermingling marriage together, as that neyther can they distinguish their Tribes now, neyther haue themselues any care so to do.</p>
